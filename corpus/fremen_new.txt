{{Quote|He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, truthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides) | Muad'Dib]]'s motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of [[Battle of Arrakeen | his triumph]], he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. That is reason enough."|from "[[Arrakis]] Awakening" by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
'''Paul Atreides''' ([[10176 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), predominantely known as '''Muad'Dib''', was the first [[Kwisatz Haderach]], the last [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides]] from [[10191 AG]] until [[10196 AG]], the first and founding [[Padishah Emperor]] of the [[Atreides Empire]] from 10196 AG until [[10210 AG]], and the supreme religious leader of the [[Fremen]] as the accepted [[Mahdi]] from [[10193 AG]] onwards. The only son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides]] {{C|née [[Nerus family | Nerus]]}}, Paul's early years were overshadowed by correct suspicions of him as the Kwisatz Haderach, achieved one generation early due to the disobedience of his mother in producing a son rather than a daughter.  

When the Atreides were forced by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] into moving from their ancestral homeworld of [[Caladan]] to the desert planet of [[Arrakis]] when Paul was fifteen, he was tested with a [[Gom Jabbar|gom jabbar]] by Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], his success in this test proving him human in the eyes of the Sisterhood. On Arrakis, Paul experienced a supposed attempted assassination attempt using a hunter-seeker, although this was in reality staged by the Harkonnens, the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|historic enemies]] of the Atreides, in order to turn attention away from the traitor planted in the Atreides household, [[Suk Doctor|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]].   

Following the [[Siege of Arrakeen]] which killed his father and decimated the Atreides, Paul and his mother were taken in by the [[Fremen]] tribe of [[Sietch Tabr]] after escaping the Harkonnens and the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]], where Paul killed for the first time in a duel with the Fremen [[Jamis]]. After this fight, Paul took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] among the Fremen and found himself becoming a leader among them, and became a good friend to Tabr [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] and the lover of his niece [[Chani Kynes]].  

Fuelled by the historic prophecies of the [[Lisan al Gaib|Lisan al-Gaib]] planted by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] centuries ago, Paul found himself inching closer and closer to great power. The years he spent on Arrakis, also saw his mother Jessica drinking the [[Water of Life]], an act which allowed her to become a Reverend Mother and one which Paul later went through with himself, and the birth of his [[Pre-born|preborn]] sister, [[Alia Atreides]]. Paul also trained the Fremen in the weirding way of the Bene Gesserit to make them into the guerilla warriors known as the [[Fedaykin]], allowing them to deal serious blows against the Harkonnens and turn the tide in the ongoing [[Desert War]] against them. When the Emperor decided to come to Arrakis himself to crush Muad'Dib and get spice production back on track, Paul launched the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in his use of [[Great Convention|forbidden]] [[atomics]] in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], a battle which also saw the death of [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|his first son]].  

Finally meeting the Emperor personally, Paul revealed to Shaddam that he would destroy all of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet in a chain reaction if he did not allow him to take the Imperial throne, leading to chaos across the [[Known Universe]]. After killing his cousin [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] in a kanly duel, the Emperor and the [[Spacing Guild]] submitted to Paul's will and he was Emperor within three years. Despite his love and loyalty to his concubine Chani, Paul married [[Princess Royal|Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino]] in his quest for the Emperor's seat in the [[Landsraad]], but found navigating this relationship complex and difficult at times.  

After ruling his new [[Atreides Empire]] for twelve years, during which the galaxy was at war in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a jihad]] which the [[Fedaykin]] spread across the universe, Paul was blinded by a [[stone burner]] in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a final conspiracy]] against the Atreides throne, but managed to see through his [[Prescience|prescient]] abilities. This presceience-sight ended after the birth of his twin children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], coinciding with Chani's death, and he walked into the desert according to Fremen Law, his sister Alia becoming [[Regent]] of the empire. In the ensuing times he became known as the Preacher, an identity he held for nine years before he was murdered while preaching his 'heresy', shortly after accepting the [[Golden Path]] planned by his son Leto II, who inherited the Imperium as [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] not long after his death and the suicide of his [[Ego-memory|possessed]] sister Alia.  

==Biography==
===Family lineage===
[[File:Dune 2020 House Atreides.jpg|thumb|The Atreides were an ancient Great House dating back to the time of Agamemnon on Old Earth.]]
[[House Atreides]] was an old and wealthy [[Houses Major|House Major]] in the [[Landsraad]], tracing their lineage back thousands of years to [[King Agamemnon]], a son of [[Atreus]] in [[Greece]] on [[Earth|Old Earth]]. The Atreides had a long-standing [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] with [[House Harkonnen]] dating back ten thousand years to the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The family kept their ancestral world of [[Caladan]] a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to the Harkonnen capital of [[Giedi Prime]]. However, the Atreides were also proficient in war; they maintained [[Swordmaster|Swordmasters]], [[Warmaster|Warmasters]] and [[Mentat|Mentats]] to train and lead their army, and had even developed their own [[Battle Language]].

The [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] brought Paul's parents, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica Nerus]], who was secretly the natural daughter of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], together in [[10175 AG]], with the intention of producing an Atreides daughter who could then mate with [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]] the Sisterhood had long prepared for. However, the Bene Gesserit plans were thrown into disarray when Jessica, due to her deep love of the Duke Leto, bore a male heir, Paul, to his House rather than a girl.  

===Early life {{C|10176-10191}}===
Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-rich planet of Caladan, the ancestral Atreides home. Though he lacked companions his own age, he received tutelage from his teachers, men like [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Wellington Yueh|Doctor Yueh]], as well as deep education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday in the year [[10191 AG]], Paul's father revealed to him that his training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a [[mentat]]. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the [[Landsraad]]. Paul's latent talents also earned him the attention of the Bene Gesserit, who tested him with the [[Gom Jabbar]], as they hoped to salvage their breeding program through him.

===Desert War {{C|10191-10193}}===
====Move to Arrakis====
{{Quote|On that first day when Muad‘Dib rode through the streets of [[Arrakeen]] with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: “[[Mahdi]]!” But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the [[Lisan al Gaib | Lisan al-Gaib]], the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a [[Bene Gesserit]] and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib. |from [[Manual of Muad’Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
[[File:Ha paul hunterseeker-1.png|thumb|Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in the first months on Arrakis.]]
Paul accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] relocated to the desert world of [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. Before their departure, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor's [[Truthsayer]], tested him with the [[gom jabbar]]. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

After a supposed assassination on Paul using a hunter-seeker, Dr Yueh lowered the defensive house shields and used sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught in the [[Siege of Arrakeen]]. The Atreides army was crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape. This attack marked the beginning of the War. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] were sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needed to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan was foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hated the Baron and wished to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to kill their captors and escape into the desert. 

====With Kynes and Idaho====
Paul and Jessica initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flde to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they had died from a coriolis storm.

====Alliance with the Fremen====
[[File:Ha paul jamis fight1-1.png|thumb|Paul fights Jamis to the death.]]
In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers came into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures exploded into awareness. He saw many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he could make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive. After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] proved their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu training – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepted them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also met a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], whom he had long seen in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarmed a proud Fremen, Jamis, who took offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenged Paul to a fight to the death. Although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphed easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. Stilgar gave Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gave himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.

When they returned to the troop's sietch, they discovered the Fremen Reverend Mother was near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they made Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen were about to do, accepted to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realized she has made a mistake, that she was involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who could see genetic memories, and realized that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, would also go through the process. This had truly unfortunate consequences, because it was a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby would not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.
[[File:Paul Atreides with Maker hooks (Frank Herbert's Dune, 2000, Sci-Fi Channel).jpg|thumb|Paul preparing to first ride a sandworm]]
By [[10193 AG]], two years later, Paul had become something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani became his lover and bore him a son, whom he called Leto. He and his mother trained the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who sought out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experienced victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grew. However, in order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he had to become a [[sandrider]]. Paul attempted it and succeeded, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr sprung a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognised his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and called on him and his men to surrender. Gurney was overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrendered his men, and joined Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, were some Imperial spies who attempted to kill Paul. They were unsuccessful, and they were captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gave secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lived on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul used the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he had become a wormrider many of his followers had expected him to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul broke tradition and in doing so forced Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus took power without killing his friend. They returned to Sietch Tabr. Gurney was shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believed she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul did not know. Gurney was about to kill her when Paul walked in, managed to stop him, and explained that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney was almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgave him and he was bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

Paul's power among the Fremen grew, but he was still frustrated. He was not all he could be: he could not control his journeys into the future, and much of it was still blank to him. So he took a truly risky step and consumed a tiny amount of spice essence, and so attempted to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man hd survived this experience, and it seemed that he failed also, because he sank into a coma. Paul neglected to tell anyone what he is doing; many people thought he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believed he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, did all she can to wake him but failed, so out of desperation she called Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realised what a mad thing Paul has done, and used spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time had passed, and he gloried in his new memories and powers — he told his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself was currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He had proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declared that it was now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he came to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levied of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again. By now the Emperor was aware of who Muad'Dib was. In advance of his arrival, he sent a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they managed to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but were driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

====Battle of Arrakeen====
[[File:Concept art Battle of Arrakeen (1984 Dune film).png|thumb|The Battle of Arrakeen led to Paul's overthrow of Shaddam IV]]
After the Emperor himself had landed, Paul launched the final attack. Using the House Atreides' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blew a hole in the Shield Wall that protected the capital of Arrakeen from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoided contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". The Fremen attacked under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorted out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar were unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they were in total surprise, and the Emperor was forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loomed in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatened to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they backed off. In the surprise of Muad'Dib's attack, Alia managed to escape, and in the process killed the Baron Harkonnen.

Realizing that Muad'dib was not some mad Fremen religious leader changed the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenged Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Paul agreed even knowing that it is possible he would die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempted treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphed.

=== As Emperor {{C|10196-10210}}===
[[File:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|Paul replaced Shaddam IV as Emperor of the Known Universe]]
Paul refused to take any more nonsense. He forced the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who controlled space travel. He again threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul is capable of it – and they sent everyone home. The Emperor abdicated and retired to Salusa Secundus in 10196 AG. Paul married the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], and assumed control of the Empire. Irulan later wrote extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought. Paul then [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|sent a Fremen jihad across the known universe]].

Upon crowning himself Emperor in 10196, Paul enacted a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire. A result of this action was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. There was resistance, and Paul found himself increasingly isolated from his family and friends as he decided that the Jihad to implement his vision of mankind's future must be bloodthirsty and relentless. Whole planets were sterilized as some of the [[Great Houses]] put up a struggle against Paul's relentless Fremen armies.

====Conspiracy====
After the bloody jihad ended, Emperor Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion. The order of the Known Universe was maintained through the replacement of Corrino imperial power, which was supported by Sardaukar military strength; with Atreides imperial power, supported by Fremen military strength.

Paul's interpretation of his prescient visions also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.

Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]]. Among the schemes of his enemies were the detonation of a [[stone burner]] near where Paul and his forces stood in [[Arrakeen]], which resulted in his physical blindness. Upon Paul's recovery from this incident, he shocked all by his ability to 'see' despite not having eyes. His perfect prescient abilities allowed him to perceive the world around him.

====Death of Chani ====
Despite being able to 'see' through prescience, doubts began to surface in Paul's mind regarding his interpretation of the future. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out. That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, a plot conceived in the presence of a powerful [[Guild Navigator]]. The [[Bene Tleilax]] gave him a [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], who contained a secret trigger. Concurrently, and part of the plan, Irulan slowly poisoned Chani. 

As the Princesses' toxins slowly worked their way through Chani's body, the [[Chani Kynes|Emperor's Consort]] died during childbirth. Immediately, the [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]], who had been posing as Chani's hand-maid, sprung into action and caused the Idaho ghola to remember his Tleilaxu mission, to kill [[Muad'Dib]]. As this caused a great mental conflict within Duncan, he remembered his past with [[House Atreides]]. Immediately, Scytale realized the great scope of change that had occurred; a ghola had recovered memories of its' former life. Scytale bargained with Paul that the Tleilaxu could bring back a ghola of Chani, complete with her life experiences, for Paul to enjoy in relative obscurity—if the Atreides would abdicate. Instead, Paul killed Scytale. He then ordered Duncan to kill [[Bijaz]].

====Walk into the Desert====
After the birth of his children, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], Paul became convinced he had lost his prescient abilities; he did not foresee the birth of his son, only his daughter. Therefore, as no more than a blind Fremen, Paul disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]], as was the Fremen custom for the blind. This action made a powerful statement: it signified to the Fremen that Paul's interest was for the tribe, and that even he, Usul, Paul who was Muad'Dib, was not above Fremen law.

===As the Preacher {{C|10210-10219}}===
[[File:Preacher01.jpg|thumb|Paul as the Preacher of Arrakeen]]
Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert. By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.

==== Death ====
The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront Alia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Leto. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.

Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion. While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transformation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.

== Appearance ==
In his youth, Paul was a small boy with an oval face, with tousled coal-colored hair and green eyes. After his time among the Fremen, he grew to a a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as desiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the leathery skin. His oval face was like his mother Jessica’s, but he had stronger bones and a browline reminiscent of his maternal grandfather. He had a thin, disdainful nose, long lashes concealing lime-toned, directly staring green eyes, and a hardness in the expression like the old Duke, his paternal grandfather.

== Abilities and skills ==
* '''[[Prescience]]''': As the Kwisatz Haderach long sought out for by the breeding programme of the Bene Gesserit Order, Paul possessed a powerful ability to bridge space and time with prescient ability. From an early age, he experienced visions in his dreams which were reported to the Sisterhood by his mother Jessica and was known to have had visions that were accurate, penetrating, and defied four-dimensional explanation. This was one of the key attributes that made them first suspect him being their long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach achieved early. Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Paul's prescient ability was strengthened by the spice melange he constantly inhaled, and it grew greatest during his alliance with the Fremen people, when he first forsaw the jihad that would be waged across the Known Universe in his name, and began to try and avert it. By the end of his reign, Paul's prescience was so powerful that when he lost his eyesight due to a Tleilaxu stone burner, he could interact with the world around him without aid. This was because he was able to remember all the details of his vision of the future. Essentially, Paul knew where everyone would be and what they would say and do. While this helped him in many situations, it was also ultimately his downfall as he was helpless to prevent his future.
* '''[[Weirding Way]]''': Paul was trained by his mother in the Weirding Way of the Bene Gesserit, allowing him to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. When first encountering Sietch Tabr this saved his life, as he was able to overcome the Fremen who saught to kill him and Jessica for their water by means of the Weirding Way. He later taught the Way to many of the Fremen across Arrakis, making them into skilled and deadly Fedaykin by these means, and this was a key factor in his victory in the Battle of Arrakeen.
* '''[[Voice]]''': At the time the Atreides landed on Arrakis, Paul was also developing the audio-neuro control mechanism of Voice used by the Sisterhood to achieve complete control over a reciever. He demonstrated his emerging talent in this field when, after the decimation of the Atreides and the capture of him and his mother into an ornithopter, he used the Voice to order a Harkonnen agent to remove Jessica's gag so that she could use it even more effectively against him, and thus saving both their lives.
* '''[[Prana-bindu|Prana-bindu control]]''': Paul was taught by the supreme control of nerve and muscles known to the Bene Gesserit as prana-bindu by Jessica, which laid the foundations for his use of the Weirding Way and allowed him to gain a higher control over his body which would come to his advantage at many points in his life.
* '''Swordfighting''': In addition to the Bene Gesserit techniques taught to him by his mother for his survival, Paul became a skilled swordfighter after years of training by his chief Atreides teachers, the renowned Swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, who he nearly bested shortly before the move to Arrakis. This proved to be a vital skill, as he employed it not only to best Jamis after he declared amtal during his early years in Sietch Tabr, but later to kill his cousin, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, another skilled fighter, in a kanly duel at the time of his ascension to Emperor. 
* '''[[Mentat]] training''': For the first fifteen years of his life, much of Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a Mentat by order of his father Duke Leto. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as the Duke of the Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a Mentat-Duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. He became a fully fledged "true" Mentat after first escaping the Harkonnens with his mother, and the high level Mentat abilities he gained at that time would help him at many points in his life, including helping handle the data of the battles of his jihad and allowing him to piece together the nature of the conspiracies which were aimed against him more quickly than he could have otherwise.
* '''Endurance''': Paul's unusual endurance, especially for a male, was noted by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam when she tested him with a gom jabbar, a test which he passed through this skill. She noted that he surmounted more agony in the test than any other human of record.

== Relationships ==
=== Leto Atreides I ===
{{Quote|How do we approach the study of Muad‘Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?|from [[Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries]] by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
Paul respected his father Leto, the penultimate Atreides Duke, who had hopes for a great future for his son as a Mentat-Duke. When Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in a supposed assassination attempt, Leto grew enraged at his Mentat Thufir, who had failed to detect the trap, and was angry that the Harkonnens had tried to take the life of his son. Paul was greatly disturbed when he heard Reverend Mother Mohiam tell his mother: "for the father, nothing", and had an urge to tell Leto what she had said, although he never did. Leto felt like Paul was one of the only people to whom he could reveal his weaknesses and fears as well as entrust the fact that he had never distrusted Jessica, a fact which he told Paul to reveal to her if he never could, and which he did after Leto's death. 

=== Chani Kynes ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Paul|You're the strong one, Chani. Stay with me.|Chani|Always.|Paul and Chani's love|Dune (novel)}}
Paul first encountered Chani Kynes, daughter of the great Planetologist Liet-Kynes, during him and Jessica's initial encounter and fight with the Fremen, but by that point he had dreamed of her many times. Stilgar told her to keep Paul out of trouble and Chani helped Paul in his fight with Jamis by warning him that Jamis fought with either hand, and that he should keep his mind on the knife and not on the hand that held it. From that point they grew closer, calling each other Usul and Sihaya, and she ultimately became his concubine, and the mother of his first son, Leto Atreides II the Elder, who was killed by Sardaukar in the Battle of Arrakeen. After Paul's ascension to Emperor Chani was considered his true wife rather than his titular wife, the Princess Irulan, and became the mother of two further children with Paul, Ghanima and Leto II, before her death. The love between them was shown by her last word: ''Usul''.

=== Duncan Idaho ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}
Paul had a close bond with his Swordmaster teacher Duncan Idaho, who trained him from his earliest years, and he was greatly distraught when Idaho fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, he found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Hasimir Fenring ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Shaddam IV|Kill this upstart for me. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now ... you know the way of it. Kill him. Do it!|Hasimir Fenring|Majesty, I must refuse.|Count Fenring refuses to kill Paul|Dune (novel)}}
Paul first met Count Hasimir Fenring in 10193 AG during his final confrontation with Emperor Shaddam IV, the Count's closest friend, following the Battle of Arrakeen. Upon seeing the Count Paul felt extreme shock, as he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures, but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions. When the Emperor ordered Fenring to kill Paul, he realised that this was because the Count was a failed Kwisatz Haderach, and looking into Fenring's eyes he felt a deep compassion for the Count flow through him, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced. Seeing this, Fenring refused to kill him, accompaning the Emperor into exile on Salusa Secundus afterwards.

=== Gaius Helen Mohiam ===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Paul Atreides|Try your tricks on me, old witch. Where’s your [[gom jabbar]]? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You’ll find me there staring out at you! Have you nothing to say?|Gaius Helen Mohiam|I welcomed you to the ranks of [[human]]s. Don’t besmirch that.|Observe her, comrades! This is a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]], patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach | one person]] their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand... but... I... will... never... do... her... bidding!”|[[Jessica Atreides | Jessica]]! Silence him!|Paul defies Reverend Mother Mohiam|Dune (novel)}}
First meeting the aged Reverend Mother Mohiam when she visited Caladan to test him with a gom jabbar, Paul took instant dislike to the 'old crone', complaining about how she addressed his mother and how she treated him. When Mohiam ordered him to sit as her mother did, he told her that he was not his mother and he preferred to stand, from which she ordained that he hated her a little. Despite being judged human by Mohiam in the test, these feelings continued. He encountered Mohiam again during his final confrontation with the Emperor, terrifying her with his final ultimatum of destroying all melange after pointing out her reliance on spice as a Reverend Mother. She recognised that Paul was indeed the Kwisatz Haderach as she had long suspected. Paul declared that he was indeed the One but he would never to her bidding, and that for her role with the Emperor he could gladly have her strangled, but he thought it better punishment that she should live out her years never able to bend him to the Bene Gesserit schemes. He retained this opinion to the last, telling Alia not to execute Mohiam for her role in the conspiracy against him shortly before his walk into the desert, although she disobeyed him.

==Name==
{{Quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.|[[Stilgar]]|Dune (novel)}}

===Etymology===
Paul's surname, that of his family of [[House Atreides]], meant "son of Atreus" in Greek, due to the Atreides' descent from [[Agamemnon]], Orestes' father and the son of [[Atreus]]. 

The name '''Muad'Dib''', given by Stilgar after Paul bested Jamis in amtal, was taken from the Fremen name for the kangeroo mouse of the Arrakis desert. While he originally called himself '''Paul-Muad'Dib''' after accepting this name, as to not completely remove the name given by his father, this did not become a common name and by his time as Emperor he was generally called only Muad'Dib. While this was the open way to refer to Paul, it was also decided after Jamis' death that the private name used within the sietch would be '''Usul''', meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar" in the Fremen language. He was also called '''Abu Dhur''' or '''Abu d' Dhur'''.

===Titles===
In addition to being the '''Kwisatz Haderach''' long sought for by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, Paul was known as both the '''Lisan al-Gaib''' and the '''Mahdi''' to the Fremen. The vanquished of his jihad called him '''the Tyrant''', a title which would later be used more widely to describe his son, the God Emperor, after his assassination. In his nine years as a nameless blind Fremen after walking into the desert, Paul was known by the title of '''the Preacher''' in absence of any name that could be given to him. He was given the postthumous title of the '''Mentat Emperor''' by the Mahdi Spirit Cult. He was given the title of '''Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time''' while being called Abu Dhur by Stilgar and later his son Leto II, who also called him the '''Fil-Haquiqa''' and '''The Reality'''.

===In earlier stages===
In the original ''[[Spice Planet (story)|Spice Planet]]'' which evolved into ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Paul was called '''Barri Linkam'''.

==Behind the Scenes==
=== Paul as a hero ===
According to novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House Atreus. Noting that the characters in ''Dune'' fit mythological archetypes, Brian Herbert wrote that "Paul is the hero prince on a quest who weds the daughter of a 'king'". A primary theme of ''Dune'' and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to "give over every decision-making capacity" to a charismatic leader. He said in 1979, "The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes." He wrote in 1985, "''Dune'' was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question." In a 1970 interview, Herbert noted that the character of Paul was constructed to express "the conflict between absolutes and the necessity of the moment". Brian Herbert wrote:<blockquote>Paul Atreides (who is the messianic "Muad'Dib" to the Fremen) resembles Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), a British citizen who led Arab forces in a successful desert revolt against the Turks during World War I. Lawrence employed guerrilla tactics to destroy enemy forces and communication lines, and came close to becoming a messiah figure for the Arabs. This historical event led Frank Herbert to consider the possibility of an outsider leading native forces against the morally corrupt occupiers of a desert world, in the process becoming a godlike figure to them.</blockquote>The similarity to T.E. Lawrence was reinforced within the novel ''Dune Messiah'', in which a chapter heading-quotation is taken from a post-conquest work of Paul's, with the title ''The Seven Pillars of the Universe''. This appears to have been inspired by Lawrence's account of his war-time activities in the desert, titled ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''.

Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him, and after a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, ''Dune'' is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Paul's riding and controlling a giant sandworm cements him as a Fremen leader, and he eventually gains a level of omniscience which leads to his accession to the Imperial throne and causes the Fremen to worship him like a god.

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of ''Dune'' from earlier heroes such as Superman, A. E. van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn, and Henry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of "painful and slow personal progress". And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through "the application of mystical philosophies and techniques". For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit and Mentats).

Denis Villeneuve, director and co-writer of the 2021 film adaptation ''Dune'', compared Paul to the character Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather'', explaining that "He's training to be the Duke. But as much as he's been prepared and trained for that role, is it really what he dreams to be? That's the contradiction of that character. It's like Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather''–it's someone that has a very tragic fate and he will become something that he was not wishing to become."

The Egyptian-Canadian commentator Khalid M. Baheyeldin has enumerated the obviously Islamic concepts and references appearing in ''Dune'', to the level of finding multiple similarities between the career of Herbert's Paul Atreides and that of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Beyond the obvious general resemblance - both Muhammad and Atreides found a powerful new religion, energizing hitherto disregarded desert-dwellers to topple an old empire and build a new one - Baheyeldin noted various specific similarities between Muhammad's career and that of Atreides.

===Biographical Notes===
In the easy-to-read Basic Dune it is bizarrely extrapolated in what is probably a joke that its fake version of Paul Atreides was born on its underdeveloped Caladan, both in an excerpt from [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan's]] ''Manual of Muad'Dib'', as well as through his own thoughts. However in the great and hard [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson|Kevin J. Anderson's]] Canon Status prequel novel ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'', his birth is revealed in the only serious and Canon to take place on the world of Kaitain. At the end of the day, only Base Dune novices debate this as his birthworld in a serious manner.

In the Canon Status ''[[Paul of Dune (novel)|Paul of Dune]]'', it is revealed to be true in full Canon that Irulan, through her history books, "streamlined the story for mass consumption". This cleverly alleviates any concern ffor ridiculous Base Dune and retains the clearly lower Canon status of the Basic Dune as a lower form, as accpeted by Dune fans globally.

===In Other Media===
Alejandro Jorodowski wanted his then 12-year-old son Brontis Jodorowski to star as Paul in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''.

In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, MacLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.

In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]]. The actor, who has a Scottish accent, reportedly adapted an American accent in a relatively short span of time just to land the role. In the 2000 miniseries, Paul was initially portrayed as a sort of "spoiled brat" in order to show the audience his growth from Atreides heir to Emperor of the Known universe.

In the Denis Villeneuve's [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 ''Dune'' film]], Paul was played by Timothée Chalamet. Villeneuve stated that Chalamet was his first and only choice to play the role of Paul Atreides saying "Timothée has that kind of charismatic power. And I needed that for the audience to believe this young man will be able to raise and lead an army, and then lead a whole planet."<ref>[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/20/timothee-chalamet-dune-denis-villeneuve-rebecca-ferguson/8424993002/ Timothée Chalamet learned this new skill from 'Dune': 'I hope I won't have to use it']</ref>  Chalamet be reprising the role of Paul Atreides in the sequel to ''Dune'', titled ''Dune: Part Two'', which is scheduled to release on October 20, 2023.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dune-2-greenlit-movie-release-date-1235036655/'Dune 2' a Go From Legendary, Warner Bros.]</ref>

Sandworm
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{FeaturedArticle}}
:''This article is about the creature, Sandworm. For information on the novel ''Sandworms of Dune'', see [[Sandworms of Dune (novel)]].''
[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|A sandworm of Arrakis.]]
The '''sandworm''' was an autotrophic animal that inhabited the planet [[Arrakis]]. Where they originated is unknown, but were introduced to Arrakis before the events of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. It lived in the vast deserts and sand dunes that stretched across the surface of the planet. Most importantly, sandworms are an essential factor in the creation of the [[Spice Melange]].

Sandworms lived beneath the sand. Attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations. This was an effort to defend their territory, of which they were highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, was extremely rare, save for the mysterious [[fremen]], who had achieved some kind of mastery over the beast.

== Physical Characteristics ==
The Sandworm was the predominant lifeform on Arrakis, both honored and feared; vital and deadly. [[File:Dune-sandworm.jpg|thumb|276px|Art by Nathan Rosario]]The sandworms were extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sensed each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats.

===Size===
By anyone's standards, Sandworms could grow to an enormous size. Dr. Yueh cited that specimens "up to 450 meters long" were spotted by observers in the [[deep desert]]. To make a comparison, the largest animal of Earth was believed to be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale Blue whale] measuring in at only 33 meters, or about 7% of a large sandworm's length.

Many things commonly associated with [[Arrakis]] are surrounded in myth and mystery, and the sandworms are no exception. Some people believe that worms from 700 to even 1000 meters existed in the southern pole regions, but this could not be confirmed. See [[Paul Atreides]] during his trial of the [[sandrider]] for further reading regarding their maximum observed size.

<br />

===Age===
Due to the difficulty of studying these creatures, not much was originally known about the wild sandworms. The longevity of the sandworm was supposedly extreme, estimated in the thousands of years.

===Appearance===
[[File:Hr-giger-dune-worm-xii.jpg|thumb|Sandworm as envisioned by H.R. Giger]]
[[File:Big-sketch4.jpg|thumb|[[Dune 2000]] concept art]]
Their skin was thick, rough, and orange colored. It served the simple function of armor and was comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size. These scales overlapped and interlocked to form the armor that protected it against internal sand invasion.

As the [[Fremen]] discovered, this armor, while all but impenetrable, could be exploited. By prying open the edges of one or more of the scales, the integrity of the armor would be compromised; sand was now free to enter into the sandworms softer insides. This would cause intense irritation for the sandworm. The beast would then roll itself until the prone scale was at the highest point from the desert floor, thus minimizing the amount of sand that could enter.

A fremen poised to "ride" the beast as it rolled its open scale towards its highest point could literally mount the worm. As long as the scales remained open, the sandworm would not submerge. [[Maker hooks]] were then placed towards the front of the beast to control lateral movement. As a result, [[wormriding]] became a viable, even sacred, method of transport for the Fremen across the surface of the planet. Indeed, distances were even measured in "sandworms", the distance one could ride a worm until it was exhausted and allowed to submerge. A 20-worm ride would be a far and difficult journey.

A sandworm's internal workings resembled that of a massive blast furnace, producing intense heat and flames. This in turn provided the environmental link of supplying oxygen to the nearly plantless Arrakis. The mouth was positioned at the forward end of the creature and could easily consume gigantic objects such as [[spice harvesters]].

===Smell===
The smell of the sandworm has been particularly documented. A strong, flinty, cinnamon smell exuded from the beast, especially from the mouth. Some said it could be smelled before seen. The presence of the [[spice melange]] was intense and so was its odor.

===Lightning===
[[File:ShaiHulud.jpg|thumb|400px|Painting of Oldman]]

The approach of a sandworm towards its breach-point was often indicated by the dry lightning that frequently occurred in the area; a result of static electricity being discharged into positively-charged air.

===Diet===
The main component of the sandworm's diet was sand, and other inorganic and dry components of the Arrakis crust. It is also believed they sifted the sand-plankton for nourishment.

==Water Poisoning==
Water was fatal to a sandworm, even in small doses. Water that entered a sandworm's body would act as catalyst to accelerate its metabolism to the point that it became unstable and its vital biological functions failed. This was a violent and presumably painful death for the sandworm. It was occasionally necessary however, since the byproduct of the sandworm/water mixture was the highly toxic poison called the [[Water of Life]], which the [[reverend mothers]] used on various occasions.

== Creation of Sandworms ==
The process of sandworm creation began when [[sandtrout]] banded together after converging on a store of water deep beneath the surface of [[Arrakis]]. Indeed, water did occur naturally on Arrakis. However, due to the aforementioned process, it was always destroyed. The [[sandtrout]]/water mixture was then converted into a liquid chemical that the sandworm was capable of digesting without being poisoned. On a side note, this chemical could erupt up to the desert's surface in a violent explosion called a [[Spice blow]].

The [[sandtrout]] that survived this event would then coalesce and complete the metamorphosis into a young sandworm.

== Cultural Impact of the Sandworm ==
[[File:Dune Chronicles of the Imperium RPG front cover (art by Mark Zug).png|thumb]]
Insofar as the sandworm was essential to the creation of the [[spice melange]], on a macro scale the sandworm had an enormous impact on humanity.

To the planet's [[Fremen]] population, the creature was a spiritual symbol of their faith and saw them as physical embodiments of the One God of their original [[Zensunni]] religion. Within [[Fremen]] culture the sandworm had several additional names, notably [[The Maker]] and [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously meant ''Old Man of the Desert'', ''Old Father Eternity'', or ''Grandfather of the Desert''

Young sandworms were used by the Fremen for special ceremonies. Inducting new [[Sayyadina]]s or [[Reverend Mother|reverend mothers]] was a prime example of the sandworms essential cultural role.

===Decline of the Sandworm ===
After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the [[Zensunni]] religion across the [[known universe]], the reverence paid to the sandworm spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II]], due to the fact that he had become something of a hybrid, both man and worm.

The terraforming of [[Arrakis]] posed a grave risk to the sandworm, which found life outside the arid desert fatal. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the sandworm once again thrive on Arrakis for approximately another 1500 years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during [[the Scattering]]. This exercise yielded questionable success.

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on [[Arrakis]], including, it was believed, the remaining sandworms. However, this was not before [[Miles Teg]] and [[Darwi Odrade]] had managed to capture a sandworm. Held in an artificial environment on [[Chapterhouse]], the secret and temporary base of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood, this worm would have been the key to re-seeding its population.

===On Chapterhouse===
The first place that Odrade's sandworms began a new [[spice cycle]] was on the [[Bene Gesserit]] homeworld of [[Chapterhouse]]. After their introduction, the [[sand trout]] began to turn the once-lush world into a desert.

== Conception ==
Author Frank Herbert conceived the sandworms based on dragon mythology, particularly fictitious dragons that guard some sort of treasure, such as the creature in ''Beowulf'' and the Dragon of Colchis from the greek myth of Jason. The sandworms of Arrakis will attack humans who attempt to harvest the Spice, as if guarding it (even though the Spice is of no interest for these creatures, since it is waste matter). The sandworms are referred to as "the dragons on the floor of the desert" in ''Children of Dune''. 

Illustrator John Schoenherr gave the sandworm three triangular lobes that form the lips of its mouth. They are also depicted as colossal lampreys or leeches (lacking the three mouth as descripted), as well as terrestrial annelids. 

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
In the 1984 film, the sandworms were portrayed as having the three triagular lobes from their lips. In addition, they were also capable of devouring humans, as can be inferred by Vladimir Harkonnen's ultimate fate in said film courtesy of Alia. For the 2021 adaptation, director Denis Villeneuve spent a year designing the look of the sandworms to make them look "possible" and "prehistoric enough", working "from the texture of the skin, to the way the mouth opens, to the system to eat its food in the sand". Their teeth are more spike in shape, in comparison to previous live-action iterations.

}}{{Quote|What can I say about Jessica? Given the oppurtunity, she would attempt [[Voice]] on [[God]].|[[Reverend Mother/XD | Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD | Gaius Helen Mohiam]]|Dune: House Corrino}}
'''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG/XD|10154 AG]] - [[10256 AG]]), born as '''Jessica Nerus,''' was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son Emperor [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], and of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

== History ==
===Upbringing===
A result of the [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] and [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]], who was called by her birth name Tanidia Nerus in breeding charts.

Due to this, prior to marrying Leto she was referred to as Jessica Nerus in Bene Gesserit records, as opposed to Jessica Mohiam or Jessica Harkonnen, which was top secret information and she was not named this.

She was raised from birth by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides]] heir Leto Atreides I, to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced Bene Gesserit education and training.
====Relationship with Leto Atreides I====
[[Image:Jessica.jpg|thumb|left|The Lady Jessica, bound concubine of the Duke Leto Atreides, played by [[Francesca Annis]]]] The Bene Gesserit plan to couple Jessica with Duke Leto Atreides I initially appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the official concubine of Leto Atreides I, which allowed him to also marry. Such political union prove advantageous for the Great [[House]].

However, Jessica felt a great pity from the grief that Leto felt over the death of his first son, [[Victor Atreides]].

The relationship between the two quickly evolved into genuine love, and due this love, Jessica disobeyed her orders and give birth to a son, Paul Atreides, who would be heir of House Atreides, and ultimately ruined the Bene Gesserit plans.

====Ilesa Ecaz====
In [[10,187 AG]], when Leto announced that he was going to marry [[Ilesa Ecaz]] to strengthen House Atreides, Jessica took this in dutiful stride. Out of her love for Leto, she genuinely tried to welcome Ilesa to [[Cala City]], and showed her the daily tasks of managing [[Castle Caladan]]. Ilesa was suddenly killed during the wedding ceremony, situation that started the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]. Once the war ended, Leto promised he would never marry, and that Jessica would be his one and only mate.

====Tessia Struck====
In [[10,188 AG]], Jessica and Paul visited [[Ix/XD|Ix]] so that Paul could spend time as an exchange student in [[Vernii]] City, just as his father had done decades earlier. To Jessica's dismay, while there, the Bene Gesserit [[guilt-caster]] [[Stokia]] and three other Sisters visited [[Tessia]] Vernius. They demanded that Tessia produce more children for the Gesserit breeding program, which Tessia refused.

Unbeknownst to Jessica, Stokia used her [[psychic]] powers to put Tessia into a comatose trance, which rendered Tessia helpless.

====Bronso and Paul Run Away====
Later that day, Rhombur decided to tell his son, [[Bronso Vernius]], about his true parentage, that he was the artificially conceived son of [[Tyros Reffa]]. Bronso, who was 11 years old, reacted bad and encouraged Paul to run away with him off-world. Jessica was concerned about her missing son, and [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] were dispatched from [[Caladan]] to aide in finding them. A few days later, they received information that both arrived first to [[Chusuk/XD|Chusuk]], and now could be found on [[Balut]] with a [[Jongleur]] performing group.
When Jessica and the rest of the searchers from House Atreides and [[House Vernius]] arrived on Balut, they found both Bronso and Paul well treated by the performing group. The Jongleur group was to give a performance in honor of the Governor of Balut's upcoming marriage in the planet's famed [[Theater of Shards]]. Paul was able to figure that an assassination attempt was planned.

Paul saved the life of the planetary Governor [[Alra Kio]], but when Rhombur pushed Balut's leader out of the way, the intense sound blast hit him, and ravaged his body. Jessica and the others recoiled in horror as Rhombus died, and Bronso cradled his dying father.

Just before Rhombur died, he whispered his last words to his son, "Is Paul safe?" Deeply hurt that his father did not speak of him or his mother while dying, Bronso cast Jessica and the rest of House Atreides out of his life for the next 12 years. The Atreides returned to Caladan.
=== Migration to Arrakis ===
[[Image:Dune210106-12.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|The Lady Jessica takes the Water of Life]] In [[10,191]] AG, when [[House Atreides]] was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]] and their son Paul. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

When [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] seized control of [[Arrakis]], Leto was killed, and Jessica and [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]]. Her grief over losing [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]], who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with his daughter [[Alia Atreides]].

====Life as a Widow====
=====Reverend Mother=====
The Fremen of [[Arrakis]] were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own [[Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her. Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged [[Reverend Mother]], Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to [[Reverend Mother]] status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination]] in her daughter Alia.

=====Duchess of Caladan=====
After her son conquered both [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]] and House Harkonnen to become Emperor, Jessica remained on [[Arrakis]] for a year. She accompanied Emperor [[Muad'Dib]] on his first official state visit back to [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. Paul and Jessica met with the minor [[Ecaz]] official that Paul had put in place as governor of Caladan, the Prince [[Xidd Orlaq]].

While there, Paul attempted to return to the joy of his childhood, but was unable to, as he realized that he was no longer just a Duke, but an Emperor. When a courier came to [[Cala City]], announcing that Fremen warriors had taken [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], Paul made his mother, [[Duchess]] and ruler of the water planet; a post that Jessica was happy to assume. A year later when Jessica visited Paul on Arrakis, she arrived with Gurney Halleck.

In Caladan, Jessica and Gurney settled into the rule of the planet with continued justice and fairness. She exspecailly loved to join in the local festivities in [[Cala City]] during the changing of the seasons. One such festival was the one of the "[[Empty Man]]".

=====Visit to Salusa Secundus=====
Paul asked his mother to accompany [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]] and [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]] on a fact-finding mission to the exiled [[Corrino]] homeworld of [[Salusa Secundus]] provide an update on the status of the terra-forming of the planet. On Salusa Secundus, the former [[Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] and his aide [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] greeted Jessica's entourage and invited them to a formal dinner. While there, the conversation was steered by Fenring towards Paul's sterilization of worlds. Only Chani could speak positively of Emperor Paul's actions.

Later that week, the fact-finding tour was guided to the other side of Salusa to witness terra-forming first hand. [[Lars Siewesca]], his assistant [[Qhomba]] and the rest of the world-altering [[planetologist]]s blew up an underground aquifer. Lars reported to those assembled that the water from the aquifer would irrigate nearby canyons and that Salusa would be a garden in a couple of centuries. Jessica observed that Shaddam had said out loud that he could not wait that long, reminding Jessica of Corrino treachery of the past.

=====The Sisterhood's Offer=====
As the years went by, and [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's Jihad]] reached fever pitch, Jessica began to wonder of her son's sanity, believing that perhaps he had turned to [[Abomination]]. During a visit to the Motherhood on Wallach IX, Jessica was approached by Mohiam and Mother Superior [[Harishka]], who offered Jessica the post of [[Mother Superior]] of the entire Bene Gesserit order, if she kill Paul.

As Jessica thought of all of the human suffering that Paul had created throughout the universe, and though torn by the thought of killing her own son, Jessica inwardly agreed that Paul had indeed become the most brutal ruler in the history of mankind.

=====Rise of Bronso=====
In a secret meeting, Paul arranged to meet his mother and the now restored relationship with [[Bronso Vernius]] of the planet [[Ix]]. Suddenly Paul stepped out of the shadows, to explain to his mother the role of the Jihad.

Paul explained to Jessica that he ''had'' to sterilize those worlds, because the people that had looked upon him as some type of Messiah, have to learn the kind of tyranny that false messianic hopes could foster. After seeing his atrocities, mankind never would trust in one human for a type of salvation again. He calmly explained that he planned to sterilize even more worlds, but was secretly evacuating the populace of each world to limit the number of deaths. He also told her about Bronso's secret mission—to write diatribes and publications about Paul's failings.

=====Murder for Peace=====
Jessica immediately returned to Caladan to find the planet in an uproar. The people of the water world had declared independence from the [[Emperor]], and were holding rallies of secession. Gurney, in Jessica's absence had tried to negotiate and reason with the planetary rebels, to no avail. When Jessica arrived at [[Castle Caladan]] in [[Cala City]], she summoned ten of the secessionist leaders to brokering negotiations. Jessica served them all a bountiful dinner with toasts of drinking water.

Unbeknownst to the rebels, Jessica secretly poisoned the water, and turned the toxic substance into an inert mixture in her own body, by using Gesserit techniques. As the mayor of Cala City, and others that Jessica had known for years fell and dropped dead, realized that she "did what she had to do" to save Caladan from the misguided rebel leaders, and from Paul's wrath had he found out about the rebellion.

====After the Death of Paul====
Immediately after the supposed death of Paul, Jessica returned with Gurney to Arrakis, out of concern for her grandchildren, Leto and Ghanima. By this time, she had somehow learned of her maternal parentage. She was also dismayed about the rising cruelty that her daughter Alia used in consolidating her power after Paul's "death". She watched with alarm as Alia created the [[Mahdinate]], a super-religious organization based on the Atreides family. Jessica was also concerned about how Alia banned all forms of opposing expression, and had executed Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso]] Vernius of Ix, for his writings the changes that Paul had gone through. She eventually returned to Caladan in deep concern for the Empire.[[Image:Jessica2.jpg|thumb|Lady Jessica by M.Stribling]]
===Later Years===
Jessica returned to [[Arrakis]], long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

For her protection against her murdering daughter, [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] (the ghola formerly known as Hayt) "kidnapped" Jessica and took her to Salusa Secundus, home of the exiled Corrino House. There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

===Legacy===
In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]]) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

Otheym
{{Original}}

'''Otheym''' was a renowned [[Fremen]] fighter and devoted follower of [[Paul Atreides]]. He was a key figure in the training of Fremen fighters in the [[Weirding Way]], and in the liberation of [[Arrakis]] from [[House Harkonnen]].

Originally from [[Sietch Gara Kulon]], Otheym came to [[Sietch Tabr]] to join Muad'dib's crusade and was one of the first [[Fedaykin]]. Otheym was also the one tasked with taking the Waters of Life to a very large pre-spice mass, which if intiated, would have created a deadly chain reaction ultimately destroying all vectors of the sandworm.

Otheym later served as a senior commander in the spread of [[Muad'dib's Jihad]] across the [[Known Universe]]. He returned to Dune after contracting the [[spitting disease]] on [[Tarahell]]. A true Fremen and friend to Muad'dib until the end, Otheym provided details on those plotting against the Atreides Emperor. He had one daughter named [[Lichna]] with his wife [[Dhuri]].

'''Alia Atreides''' (November<ref>Book II of ''Dune'' ends in mid-autumn, which is late October or early November. Alia has still not been born. Early in Book III, Alia is stated to be about two years old. We also know that it is still 10,193 at the end of Book III, due to Appendix IV. It seems very unlikely that Book III covers just a month, so we can make a fair assumption that Alia was born in November 10,191.</ref> [[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), also known as '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' and later '''Coan-Tean''' ("the female death-spirit who walks without feet") to the [[Fremen]] and called '''Hawt the Fish Monster''' on the outer worlds, was the posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], born on the planet [[Arrakis]]. She was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides]]. As [[regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based on the cult of her personality. She later leapt to her death in defiance of the possession by the spirit of a younger [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] retained in her [[Other Memory]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Alia was still in the womb when Jessica took the [[Water of Life]]. Thus she was [[pre-born]], and highly susceptible to [[Abomination]] from before birth. After living with the [[Fremen]] for several years, she was present in the palace on [[Arrakeen]] when her brother and his forces successfully conquered the combined forces of the [[Emperor|Emperor's]] [[Sardaukar]] and [[House Harkonnen]].

During the invasion she poisoned Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] with a [[Gom Jabbar]], although not before revealing to the latter her familial ties to Harkonnen, and slew dying soldiers on the battle field for their water, earning her the name St. Alia of the Knife.

===Regency===
====Establishing Her Rule====
Later, upon the death of Paul, and with his children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule, Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]]. She was corrupted by power and established a cult of personality, using rich trappings and grandiose titles such as the [[Mahdinate]] to build considerable political weight.

====Into Abomination====
Shortly thereafter, Alia fell fully into Abomination, and was secretly tormented by the living personalities of countless ancestors. Chief among these was the personality of Vladimir Harkonnen, who sought to use his granddaughter as a tool to reclaim power from beyond the grave.

====Relationships====
Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with [[Fremen]] was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.

Though she loved and admired Paul, her brother, she also partly resented his influence. And her love for the original [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] was ultimately destroyed by a casual affair with [[Javid]], one of her priests who secretly served the [[Fremen]] insurgents who plotted against her.

====Spiralling Downward====
During the same years in which she held herself aloof from family and friends, Alia indulged in massive doses of [[spice melange|melange]], ostensibly for the purpose of broadening her [[prescience|prescient]] vision. However, Alia lacked her brother's prescient ability, and the [[spice trance]] most often failed her. The same drug which had initially keyed her sensitivity to her ancestral voices could be depended upon to keep those same voices from becoming blurred or unavailable. As a result, Alia's heavy melange consumption became a means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors and gave them power.

Alia's actions during her Regency were those of a power-hungry woman aided by the memories of generations of ambitious rulers and princelings. Her people began to mistrust and fear her, calling her, by the time of ''Children of Dune'', Coan-Teen, the "female death-spirit who walks without feet." Her every maneuver including her marriage to the first Duncan Idaho ghola, was seen as having been performed in order to solidify her own position, and her manipulation of the children in whose names she ruled was also considered a devious maneuver. Not content with having destroyed herself, she set about to lead her niece and nephew into similarly destructive ways. Since the most direct way of achieving this goal involved the children's becoming enmeshed in their ancestral memories, Alia continually tried to interest them in the spice trance.

====Death====
After increasing pressure and control from the internal genetic council of Vladimir Harkonnen, Alia orders the assassination of [[The Preacher]], despite knowing it was her beloved brother. Upon Leto's return from the desert and a subsequent battle, he gives her a choice, the Trial of Possession or suicide. In a final act of defiance against the surmounting internal control from the Baron, Alia throws herself from a high window to her death, a death that was witnessed by her mother Jessica, the Atreides twins, and Farad'n Corrino.

Had it not been for her death, Alia could have continued to rule for several centuries by regenerating her cellular structure. According to Fremen tradition, as with all Abominations the only cure was death.

===Legacy===
The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. In the months prior to Leto II's death, a [[Cult of Alia]] was discovered on [[Giedi Prime]] by Duncan Idaho's agents. Ultimately, Alia's influence vanished after Leto's death, some three and a half thousand years after her own death.

*In the ''[[Children of Dune]]'' TV mini-series, Alia kills herself with a [[crysknife]], instead of committing suicide by autodefenestration.
*[[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] portrayed Alia in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie]]. While still directly responsible for Harkonnen's demise, her method of killing him is slightly different, as she instead telekinetically shoves him out of a window and has a sandworm devour him.

The name Alia (also spelt Alya or Aaliyah) means "[http://www.behindthename.com/name/alya sky, heaven, loftiness]" in [[wikipedia:Arabic language|Arabic]] and "other, another, else" in Latin. In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 film]], [[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] portrays the character wearing a [[wikipedia:Hijab|Hijab]], a headscarf commonly worn by [[wikipedia:Arab people|Arab]] and [[wikipedia:Muslim|Muslim]] women.

Though it was not shown in the films, in the books Alia was stated to have begun to gain weight toward the end, A "plumpness which had begun to bulge her body", showing she might have been overindulging due to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's influence.

'''Naib Stilgar''' was a [[Fremen]] who was the [[Naib]] of [[Sietch]] [[Sietch Tabr|Tabr]] and the Governor of [[Arrakis]] from [[10196 AG]] onwards. He was a close friend and chief advisor to [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides|Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|?-10191}} ===
Stilgar was born at some point in time on Arrakis, and became Naib of Sietch Tabr after calling the previous Naib out. He had two wives, one of whom was [[Tharthar]].

=== Desert War {{C|10191-10193}} ===

==== Change of fief ====
Upon the change of the Arrakis fief in [[10191 AG]] from [[House Harkonnen]] to [[House Atreides]], Stilgar was befriended by Atreides [[Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]], who had been sent in advance by [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] to gauge and study the Fremen. In Idaho's reports to Leto, Idaho had judged Stilgar to be a 'good example' of the Fremen of Arrakis. Indeed, through Idaho's relationship with Stilgar and his tribe, he became so impressed with the Fremen and their ways that Idaho accepted dual loyalties to the Atreides and to Stilgar.

==== Open war ====
After House Harkonnen [[Siege of Arrakeen|attacked]] Arrakis and House Atreides went renegade, beginning the [[Desert War]], the remaining members of the Atreides family, namely the Ducal heir [[Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], sought refuge with Stilgar and his tribe, who spared them after trying to take their water and being bested. Stilgar soon became a good friend of Paul's. However, over time, as Paul developed his [[prescience|prescient]] powers, Stilgar became more of a religious follower. As the War reached it's climax, Stilgar fought during the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]].  

=== Later life {{C|10193-10219}} ===
Paul became Emperor in [[10196 AG]] and Stilgar was granted the stewardship of Arrakis later that same year, also becoming a commander in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's loose Jihad]]. In [[10208 AG]], at the end of Paul's Jihad, Stilgar helped him settle the [[Tupile Treaty]] and the matter of the [[Ixian Confederacy]]. In [[10210 AG|10207 AG]], when Paul walked into the desert, blind, Stilgar executed the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Korba|Korba the Panegyrist]] and the Guild [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], disobeying Paul's prior orders against this.  

In [[10219 AG]], later in the regency of Alia, who had become possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Stilgar declared Sietch Tabr neutral in the war between the allies of the Lady Jessica and her grandchildren and Alia. However, he killed the Duncan Idaho ghola (Hayt) who was Alia's husband, after Duncan killed [[Javid]], violating sanctuary, and so was forced to turn against the Regent. After this, he was instrumental in allying the Fremen tribes with the allies of Jessica. Upon the ascension of [[Leto Atreides II]] not long after, Stilgar thought of a time earlier in the year when he thought of slaying Leto while he was sleeping, and privately noted that it was now 'too late'.   

=== Legacy ===
Stilgar lived a long and prestigious life, thanks in no small part to his diet of [[Spice Melange|spice melange]], a pervasive ingredient in all Fremen food and drink. Stilgar's descendants flourished well into the reign of [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], and probably beyond. He wrote a preface for the book ''"Muad'Dib, The Man"'' for the Princess [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]]. Long after his death, his seed cells were among those stored in the nullentropy tubes of the Tleilaxu Masters. 

== Physical appearance ==

Stilgar was a thin man, with darkly veined hands a thin nose and a full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard.

Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)
{{Original}}

{{disambigLink|[[Paul Atreides]]|Muad'Dib}}

[[File:Muaddib.png|thumb|The mouse shadow in the second moon]]

'''Muad'Dib''' was the name adopted by [[Paul Atreides]] after he was accepted by the [[Fremen]] as one of their own.

== Symbolism ==
The symbolic definition is broader in complexity. It is part the chosen name of manhood that [[Paul Atreides]] selects when he is accepted into the Fremen. It is one of two names that Paul maintains within the tribe. [[Stilgar]] explains that the first, Usul, means "strength of the base of the pillar". That it is his secret name, his troop name, that only Sietch Tabr may use and none other may presume.

The second name, Muad'Dib, is that by which he is known openly. Paul took the name from the small mouse of the desert and his choice pleased and impressed Stilgar, as well as other Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]].

{{quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib.|Stilgar|Dune}}
The English pronunciation of this word calls for a short "i", there is an almost identical word in Arabic, مُؤَدِّب ''mu'addib'', which means "private tutor" or "teacher". It used to be that the Caliphs, the rulers of the Muslim world, would hire a ''mu'addib'' to teach their children. The practice seemed to be common for other strata of society as well.

== Paul-Muad'Dib ==

Paul is reluctant to throw away his full past and get rid of the full name his father gave him, which is why he first wished to be called Paul-Muad'Dib. Unfortunately, this name was soon forgotten and became simply "Muad'dib". Also, it was hoped that by keeping the name his father gave him, he could prevent the mass slaughter that would occur later in his name. Sadly, he could not.

The meanings of both Usul and Muad'Dib have powerful ramifications and foreshadowing for the purpose Paul has on Arrakis.

After escaping the successful invasion of [[Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen]], and proving their value to the [[Fremen]], [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and his mother [[Jessica Atreides]] were accepted into [[Sietch Tabr]] by the [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]].

[[Paul Atreides|Paul]] was instructed to take a [[Fremen]] word as his new name. While lost in the deep desert prior to being intercepted by [[Stilgar]] and his clan, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] had spotted a small but nimble creature foraging on a rock outcrop. The creature had been a [[desert mouse]]. Upon asking the name of the creature, and being told it was called ''"Muad'Dib"'' by the [[Fremen]], he chose it as his new name.

[[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] choice in name was also marginally influenced by the prescient visions he had begun to have after arriving on [[Arrakis]]. In one recurring vision he saw throngs of [[Fremen]] chanting the word ''"Muad'Dib"'' at him in a subservient manner.

'''Duncan Idaho''' was originally a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Ginaz Swordmaster]] in the service of the honorable [[House Atreides]] during the last days of the [[Corrino Empire]], and one of the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]]'s right-hand men, with [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat]], and regarded as something of a ladies' man.

After falling in the [[Desert War]] on [[Arrakis]], he grew in importance from this relatively obscure role through a series of [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[ghola]] incarnations over the next five thousand years, first playing a key role as a Mentat in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|the final plot]] against [[Padishah Emperor|Pa]] n becoming the husband of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]], which was followed by his time as the [[Commander]] of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]]'s forces, and finally as an important figure in [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|the war]] between the [[Bene Gesserit]] and [[Honored Matres]].

== Biography ==
=== Original life {{C|?-10191}} ===
{{Quote|Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldier. Atreides field-hand on the field of battle.|[[Bijaz]] describing ther original Duncan to [[Hayt]]|Dune Messiah}}

==== Early life  ====
Duncan was born and raised on [[Giedi Prime]].<ref name=":5">[[Heretics of Dune|''Heretics of Dune'']], Chapter 3 (''Bene Gesserit Analysis'') - "Gammu . . . the original Duncan Idaho was born and raised there."</ref> His sister died there as a victim of the Harkonnens.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 5 - "“Your sister died there, a victim of the Harkonnens".</ref> He was rescued from Harkonnen bondage by the [[Old Duke|Old Duke Atreides]]<ref>''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', Chapter 31 (''Songs of Gurney Halleck'') - "Duncan saw only the face of the Old Duke telling him to obey. It was too much."</ref> and came under the service of the Atreides on [[Caladan]] after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens. He was then trained on [[Ginaz]] where he graduated as a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 4 (''Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries'') - "There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz..."</ref><ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', Chapter 3 (''Tleilaxu Theorem'') - "The body was sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School."</ref>

==== Atreides service  ====
The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], the concubine of the Old Duke's son [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgment was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with the Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]], a man who was also rescued from Giedi Prime by the Old Duke. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education. 

===== War of Assassins with Grumman =====
At some point, a [[War of Assassins]] [[War of Assassins of Houses Ginaz and Moritani|ignited]] between [[House Ginaz]] and [[House Moritani]], the ruling class of the planet [[Grumman]], in which he emperors of [[House Corrino]], particularly [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], supported House Moritani, and [[House Atreides]] supported House Ginaz.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', "Terminology of the Imperium"</ref> This war was Duncan's first real experience in mortal combat and was where he first killed, slaying a Harkonnen.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 17 (''The Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib'') - "My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon ... Harkon ... killed ’im f’r th’ Duke."</ref>
[[File:Dune 2020 Duncan Idaho.jpg|thumb|Duncan as Atreides Swordmaster]]

=====Move to Arrakis  =====
Later, when the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief under the order of the [[Emperor|Padishah Emperor]] in [[10191 AG]], Idaho went a week early to the desert planet to lead the second wave onto the planet.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 4 (''A Child's History of Muad'Dib'')</ref> Encountering [[Stilgar|Naib Stilgar]] and [[Sietch Tabr]], he later became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 12 (''Manual of Muad'Dib'')</ref>

===== Death =====
When the Emperor launched [[Siege of Arrakeen|an attack]] on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho escaped the massacre. He initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes, Lady Jessica and Paul, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar.<ref name=":0">''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 25 (''Arrakis Awakening'')</ref>

Duncan was killed by one by a blow to the head, but not before he dispatched no less than nineteen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly.<ref>''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]'', Chapter 32 (''Stilgar’s Report to the Landsraad Commission'') - "The Sardaukar who’d slain him reported his prowess: nineteen of their number dispatched by Idaho before he’d fallen."</ref> In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], allowing them to escape in an ornithopter.<ref name=":0" />
===First rebirth {{C|10196-10219}}===
After Paul's ascension to the throne in [[10196 AG]], Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]], a clone made by the [[Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as '[[Hayt]]' in his ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', Chapter 6 (''The Emperor Paul Muad’dib'')</ref>

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In the ensuing trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a [[Bene Tleilax]] plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], but only if he abdicated his throne.<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]],'' Chapter 23 (''Children's Verse'')</ref>

====Second death====
[[File:Dune stilgar wierds out on duncan|thumb|Duncan confronts Stilgar shortly before his second death]]
Idaho married [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], in 10210. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. 

In 10219, in order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed [[Javid]], Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Duncan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.<ref>''[[Children of Dune]]'', Chapter 55 (''The Story of Liet-Kynes'')</ref>

=== Incarnations under Leto II {{C|10219-13728}} ===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for 3,508 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times, and as leader of the [[Fish Speakers]]. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience and memories of all his ancestors, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The [[ego-memories]] of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.
[[File:Duncangod.webp|thumb|Duncan in the chambers of the God Emperor]]
The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of religious tyranny and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm). 

Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes".<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 7 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref> In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself, and in at least one instance he died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin - in another, he died under a Sardaukar sword, when Leto still used them as his fighting force. In one anomalous occasion, Idaho died in a 'thopter crash.<ref>''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', Chapter 42 (''Ancient Drinking Toast'')</ref> In another even rarer occasion, Duncan had accidentally blew himself up after an attempt on Leto's life which he abandoned when the Emperor convinced him he was doing the wrong, causing him to toss the explosive, in which the materials were unstable, to the side.<ref name=":1">''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 5 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" since most Duncans only possessed the memories of the original Idaho. If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.

==== Suppression of Wallach IX ====
In 13650, Duncan was charged by Leto to travel to [[Wallach IX|Wallach IX,]] where he would extinguish the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on the planet in order to enforce Leto's ban of the ancient [[Order of Mentats]]. This brought him great pain, as he, a Mentat, was forced to suppress a school that trained people the way he was trained. 

During the suppression, he talked to Sister Tersius Helen Anteac, one of the Mentat trainees<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Chapter 27 (''The Coda'')</ref> who escaped the planet shortly after, renaming herself Tertius Eileen Anteac, under the name of which she would later try and kill the God Emperor. Other Mentat-Sisters escaped as well, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood. This incarnation of Duncan died just ten years after the suppression.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 17 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

==== Penultimate Incarnation under Leto ====
In his penultimate incarnation still serving the God Emperor, the one after his life in which he suppressed Wallach IX, Duncan had two children with the Fish Speaker [[Irti]] in [[Shuloch|Goygoa]]; one in 13712, and another in 13720.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 26 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref> In 13727 he made his last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun supplied to him by the Ixian Ambassador [[Iyo Kobat]]. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him.<ref name=":1" />

==== Last incarnation in Leto's service ====
After this last time in which he was killed by the God Emperor, a new Duncan was given to Leto by the Bene Tleilax in 13728. This Duncan fell in love with Siona Atreides, a girl hidden from prescience who rebelled against Leto, and became good friends with Siona's father and Leto's majordomo, Moneo Atreides, despite Moneo easily beating him in combat and thus shaming him later on.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 41 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

Ultimately, Duncan joined a final attempt on Leto's life with Siona and her assistant and co-conspirator Nayla. During the God Emperor's wedding with his love, the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree, Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by Nayla. Leto, Hwi and Moneo fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]], named after Duncan In dying, the God Emperor released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 53 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

===== After Leto's Death =====
After the assassination, Duncan had nine daughters and a thousand sons with Siona - these children and these children's children, and so on, were hidden from prescience. The significant descendants of these many children, which were said to have "Siona blood", meaning they were shrouded from the prescient vision, included [[Hadi Benotto]]<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 54 (''Excerpt from the Hadi Benotto secret summation on the discoveries at Dar-es-Balat'')</ref>, [[Darwi Odrade]], [[Lucilla]]<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Chapter 6 (''Leto II (The Tyrant)'') - “I have Siona blood. He cannot see me.”</ref>, [[Miles Teg]] and [[Sheeana Brugh]]. Duncan and Siona also inherited a portion of Leto's empire, which rapidly detoriorated into the [[Famine Times]] and the [[Scattering]].

Ultimately, long after the death of this incarnation, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola, born in 15216, survived.

===Final incarnation {{C|15216-15240}} ===
====On Gammu====
In 15229, on Gammu (formerly Giedi Prime), Duncan fled to an old Harkonnen no-globe with Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit [[bashar/XD|Bashar]], and Reverend Mother Lucilla, after an attack on the Bene Gesserit Gammu Keep. Miles Teg was commissioned to restore Duncan's memories, and managed to do so. Duncan, Teg and Lucilla were ambushed during an operation with the general Burzmali. Teg was captured but Duncan managed to escape with Lucilla.

When [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matre]], tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play when he overwhelmed Murbella in combat, and all of the memories of the hundreds of previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released. Duncan and Lucilla were located by Miles Teg and brough to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella in a no-ship. Duncan, Murbella, Lucilla, Sheeana Brugh, Darwi Odrade and Tleilaxu Master Scytale were put in the no-ship with a sandworm while Teg launched [[Battle of Rakis|a final suicidal defense of Rakis]].

==== Imprisoned on Chapterhouse ====
[[File:Chapter.jpg|thumb|Duncan was imprisoned inside a no-ship on Chapterhouse for ten years.]]
After the destruction of Rakis, the no-ship was brough to Chapterhouse in a no-ship, which became their prison, as well as Scytale's, by the Bene Gesserit. Over the next ten years, Murbella and Idaho sired four children. Idaho was then used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola. By this time, he had been allied with Reverend Mother [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] for some time, who stole the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Over the decade he spent imprisoned within the no-ship, he had continous visions of a pair of mysterious and powerful elderly-looking entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] and something he began to call [[Net, the|"the Net]]". He deducted that these beings had found a new way to apply the ancient theories of [[Holtzman]], and was almost certain they were the [[Ones of Many Faces]] who had chased the Matres back into the Old Empire.

==== Escape from Chapterhouse ====
In 15240, after Murbella became both Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit and Great Honoured Matre of the Honoured Matres, and began the combination of the two groups,  Duncan escaped with his ward, [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] and others aboard the no-ship into unchartered space to escape from the now-combined Gesserit/Matres group, the [[New Sisterhood]]. Exhibiting [[prescience]] abilities, Idaho was the only person that could see the net that Daniel and Marty cast to ensare the no-ship. To escape this net, Duncan Idaho deleted all of the navigation records of the no-ship, rendering those onboard truly lost. Duncan and the others' fate from this point remains unknown.

== Abilities and skills ==
''Note:'' As originally the memories of each rebirth of Duncan would pick up with his death on Arraksi, some incarnations had abilities which others did not. All of the following, however, were possessed by his final incarnation, who regained the memories of all of his previous lives.

* '''Swordfighting''': Duncan was trained as a Ginaz Swordmaster, which made him an adept at swordfighting, giving the Atreides a great warrior. Duncan's abilities in this area were demonstrated in multiple instances, perhaps the most notable being his killing of a full nineteen Sardaukar, the finest warriors in the Imperium, in a short time before his first death. This was one of the many motivations of the original taking of his cells by the Emperor's warriors, as well as one of the reasons why the God Emperor appointed him as Commander of his forces and continously brought him back and why the Bene Gesserit continued to resurrect him after Leto II's death. 
* '''Resistance to [[Voice/XD|Voice]]''': In his original lifetime, Duncan was taught by Paul Atreides the techniques used to resist the Bene Gesserit Voice of command, an ability which gave the Sisterhood less power over him, such as when the Reverend Mother Lucilla tried and failed to use Voice on Duncan in his final incarnation on Gammu.
* '''[[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] training''': In his first rebirth as the ghola Hayt, Duncan was trained by the Bene Tleilax as a Mentat in addition to a Zensunni philosopher. The God Emperor later trained him as a Mentat in a few of his later incarnations.
* '''[[Truthsayer]]''': Leto II also trained him as a Truthsayer in a few of his lives.

== Relationships ==

=== Paul Atreides ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Duncan had a close bond with his beloved Duke's son Paul, who he taught in swordfighting from his earliest years, and Paul was greatly distraught when he fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis, saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, Paul found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Stilgar ===
{{Quote|Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho. The body of [[Turok | our friend]] remains with [[Leto Atreides I | your Duke]]. His water is [[House Atreides | Atreides]] water. It is a bond between us.|Stilgar shortly after the agreemenet of Duncan's duel alleigance|Dune (novel)}}When Duncan was sent by the Duke Leto to make contact with the Fremen, the first he befriended was Stilgar, Naib of Sietch Tabr, which was the first sietch which Duncan found. In the relatively short time the two knew each other, they grew great respect for each other, Stilgar aknowledging that Duncan measured well in his sietch and observed the customs and honor among the Fremen people. Because of this, when Stilgar met the Duke Leto they agreed that Duncan would have duel alleigance to the Atreides and the Fremen. 

Eighteen years later, when Duncan's first ghola Hayt was presented to Paul, Stilgar initially mistrusted Hayt, declaring that Duncan was dead and this was not him, but ultimately grew a new friendship with the ghola, which grew even deeper when Hayt's memories were restored. At the last, however, Stilgar and Duncan were enemies once more; after Duncan murdered Javid and gave Stilgar the three greatest Fremen insults, he was forced by his honor to finally kill Idaho, an act which Duncan nevertheless called the right choice and one which forced him to subsequently move against the Regent Alia.

=== Bijaz ===
{{Quote|We are like brothers. We grew in the same [[axlotl tank | tank]]: I first and then you.|Bijaz describes his connection with Duncan while imprisoned in [[Arrakeen]]|Dune Messiah (novel)}}
Duncan first met the dwarf Bijaz as Hayt, before he regained his original memories. He took an instant dislike to him, mistrusting the dwarf and being wary in his presence and particularly distraught at Bijaz's provocative use of his original name of Duncan Idaho. However, Hayt and Bijaz also had a fundemental connection in that they had been grown in the same Tleilaxu axolotl tank, making Bijaz compare them to brothers.

During Hayt's conversation with Bijaz after their initial meeting, the ghola noted that he radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observor think of ancient idols and threatened to order a guard to strangle him in an attempt to indimiate the dwarf, who also was not fond of Hayt, calling him a callous lout. When Hayt asked what Bijaz planned to do with him, he said that he would do him a simple kindness. Following the reawakening of Duncan's memories in Hayt, Paul ordered him to kill Bijaz before he succumbed to the Tleilaxu plan, and Duncan obeyed without hesitation, saying that he had been the one to do Bijaz the 'kindness.'

=== Moneo Atreides ===
Over many ghola incarnations in the latter days of the reign of Leto II, the God Emperor's majordomo Moneo Atreides grew a great affection for Duncan, although after each rebirth Duncan experienced meeting Moneo all over again. Duncan's last incarnation under Leto II, the one which assassinated him, was at one point easily bested by Moneo in combat, embarrassing him and creating somewhat bitter feelings between them, although the majordomo later apologised.

=== Schwangyu ===
During the long training of his final incarnation in the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu, Duncan had many Bene Gesserit teachers, but he despised none above the Reverend Mother Schwangyu, who was a member of the faction who opposed Mother Superior Tararza and also became a traitor to the Sisterhood for the Bene Tleilax. He eventually repeated the private mantra, 'Damn Schwangyu!', and showed little if any regret for her murder by Honored Matres when the Keep was attacked.

== Behind the scenes ==

* Idaho is portrayed by the late [[America|American]] actor [[Richard Jordan]] in the [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film adaption]] of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. 
* [[James Watson]] portrayed him in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 miniseries]] adaption, but for the 2003 sequel adaption of ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' and ''[[Children of Dune]]'', ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'', [[Edward Atterton]] was recast as Duncan to play his first [[ghola]] ([[Hayt]]). 
* In the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film adaptation]], Duncan was portrayed by ''Aquaman'' star [[Jason Momoa]].
* Alejandro Jorodowski wanted French actor Alain Delon to portray Duncan in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''. Delon is notably known to have been a screen sex symbol from the 1960s and 1970s.
* Duncan is the only character to make an appearance in all six of [[Frank Herbert]]'s original ''Dune'' novels, albeit in different incarnations. 
* The [[The Dune Encyclopedia|1984's Dune Encyclopedia]] - notably presented as a flawed in-universe document - states that Duncan is a native from Caladan. This is, like a number of other facts from that book, contradicted both by''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', where Duncan's ultimate ghola makes multiple mention of his childhood on Giedi-Prime. It's this later version that is expanded upon in [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s first book in their ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' trilogy: [[House Atreides]].

Mahdi
{{Original}}

[[File:Paul Administers the Oath of the Fedaykin (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb|Painting by John Schoenherr.]]

'''[[wikipedia:Mahdi|Mahdi]]''', Arabic "المهدي" (al-Mahdi, lit. "the Guided One") or "المنقذ" (al-Munqidh, lit. "the deliverer" ), was the name used by the [[Fremen]] to describe their saviour in their messianic legend. The term equated roughly to ''"The one who will lead us to paradise".''

==History==
In conjunction with the wider Fremen legend of salvation, the Mahdi was also known to be an off-worlder (i.e. not a native of [[Arrakis]]), and the child of a [[Bene Gesserit]]. Thus, after [[Paul Atreides]] fell in with the Fremen and first displayed his [[prescience]] and fighting skills, many Fremen gradually began to see the young [[Duke]] as the Mahdi.

The legend associated with the Mahdi was at least partially influenced by a long-standing [[Panoplia Propheticus]] by the Bene Gesserit's [[Missionaria Protectiva]] wing. Lady Jessica noted that the Mahdi legend's presence on Arrakis was an indication of just how awful conditions there were, since it was reserved only for those cultures where a Bene Gesserit would need to assume total control.

[[File:Fremen2000.jpg|thumb|Fremen -Dune 2000 PC game]]

'''Ichwan Bedwine''' was a term used by by the [[Fremen]] to describe a brotherhood that encompassed all [[sietch]]es on the planet [[Arrakis]]. Thus, it was used to invoke unity and collective direction among the distant and sometimes discordant tribes.

The term was first used by [[Stilgar]] upon welcoming [[Paul Atreides]] into a permanent member of his sietch. Stilgar later remarked that Jamis would be given a proper parting ceremony as he was a member of the Ichwan Bedwine.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)]]''</ref>

Mapes
{{Original}}

[[File:Shadout Mapes with a crysknife (by John Schoenherr).png|thumb|Shadout Mapes with a [[Crysknife|crysknife]] (art by [[John Schoenherr]])]]

The [[Shadout]] '''Mapes''' was the head housekeeper in the Imperial Residence in the city of [[Arrakeen]] on the planet [[Arrakis]] when the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] took control of that planet in 10,191AG.

Mapes was one of the first [[Fremen]] that many of the Atreides encountered on a personal basis when they arrived on Arrakis. Mapes had approached the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] in the hopes of determining if she was the one the Fremen prophecies spoke of. In turn, Jessica managed to learn a great deal from Mapes regarding Fremen superstitions and legends implanted on Arrakis by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]]. In true Fremen fashion, Mapes kept a [[crysknife]] concealed on her person. However, when she determined that the Lady Jessica was indeed the [[Bene Gesserit]] the Fremen legends spoke of, she gave the [[knife]] to Jessica, who kept it on her thereafter.

Shortly thereafter, Mapes was almost killed by a [[Hunter Seeker]] meant for the [[Duke|Ducal]] Heir, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. In return for saving her life, Mapes informed Paul that the Fremen were aware that a traitor was among them. However, she did not know their identity.

When [[Wellington Yueh]], the House Atreides [[Suk Doctor]] dropped the house shields, he stabbed Mapes, who died trying to warn [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]].

Sandrider
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Otheym (Dune CCG, art by Mark Zug).jpg|thumb]]

'''Sandrider''' is the [[Fremen]] term for one who is capable of capturing and riding one of the great [[sandworm]]s of [[Arrakis]].

A Sandrider ready to catch a sandworm was called a Hookman, and a Sandrider riding a worm was called a Worm-Steersman.

In order to lead the Fremen, [[Paul Atreides]] had to become a sandrider. Normally, Fremen become sandriders by the age of twelve.

===Original Sandrider===

According to the [[Legends of Dune]] trilogy, the first Sandrider was a young [[Zensunni]] named Selim. Selim was exiled from his [[Sietch]] for water theft. However, Selim was not guilty of the crime but set up by a son of an elder village member. During his exile, Selim learned that if the segments of a worm were separated, then the worm would roll to keep the open wound from the abrasion of the sand. Using a small metal rod at first, Selim rode an ancient worm until the creature died. After several more rides, Selim decided it was not necessary to drive each worm he rode to death by exhaustion. He would then allow the worm to live, while he scurried to nearby rock formation to survive. Eventually, young Selim became known as [[Selim Wormrider]].

Ramallo
{{Original}}

'''Ramallo''' was the [[Fremen]] [[Sayyadina]], or rogue [[Reverend Mother]] of [[Sietch Tabr]]. She lived during the time [[House Atreides]] came to administer [[Arrakis]] under [[Imperium|Imperial]] decree in 10,191AG.

Ramallo was a Fremen woman who had taken the [[Water of Life]] and changed it successfully, thus unlocking her [[Other Memory]]. She was a mother figure and a woman of wisdom for the Fremen of Sietch Tabr. Upon their arrival, she accepted [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], a [[Bene Gesserit]] adept, and her son Paul, offering them both cryptic advice about the future.

When the Fremen of Sietch Tabr were forced to move deeper into the desert in response to increasing Harkonnen aggression, Ramallo declared that she was too old to survive the journey. Jessica succeeded Ramallo, who died just as Jessica successfully changed the Water of Life.

==Behind the Scenes==
It has been speculated, due to her behavior and her portrayal in the 2000 miniseries (Jessica refers to her as "one of our missionaries"), that Ramallo may have been an actual Bene Gesserit who had gone rogue, as opposed to simply occupying a position set up by the Sisterhood's [[Missionaria Protectiva]], who had planted myths and legends on Arrakis eons before the arrival of the Atreides. However, no direct evidence for this theory exists.

'''Jamis''' ([[10159 AG]] - [[10191 AG]]) was a [[Fremen]] of [[Sietch Tabr]], best known as the man who was bested by [[Paul Atreides]] when he and his mother [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] were first given sanctuary by [[Stilgar]]. He was also known to be adept in playing the nine-stringed [[baliset]].

== Biography ==

=== Earlier life {{C|10159-10191}} ===
Jamis had a reputation for fighting ferociously. He was regarded as a good Fremen, but encumbered by the major flaw of faulty self-control. Undoubtedly, Jamis' greatest usefulness to the tribe lay in his superiority as a fighting man; as a raider he was formidable. Stilgar in his Chronicle pays tribute to Jamis' bravery and skill. Even though Stilgar once bested Jamis in a fight, Jamis did not hesitate to save Stilgar's life at [[Hole-in-the-Rock]]. Stilgar also spoke of Jamis sharing his water during the [[Siege of Two Birds]] and of his valiant sacrifice at [[Bight-of-the-Cliff]]. When a [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] patrol pinned down a troop from Sietch Tabr, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved. On the other hand, the fury that sustained him in battle also crippled him, for Stilgar had further noted: ''"There's too much violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader —too much [[ghafla]]."''

This exuberance, however, did not always work to his detriment; it won him a good Fremen woman, [[Harah]], for his wife. Jamis called out [[Geoff]], her mate, and bested him. Harah spoke fondly of Jamis. She noted that he loved their children; [[Kaleff]], Geoff's son, and [[Orlop]], their own. He made no distinction between them and accorded the same devotion to their upbringing. Presumably he taught his sons the rules of water discipline and the Fremen way of fighting.

=== Duel and death {{C|10191}} ===
Jamis was numbered among the troop sent into the desert by [[Liet Kynes|Liet Kynes']] [[distrans]] message to seek the strangers, Paul Atreides and his [[Bene Gesserit]] mother. When the troop came upon them at [[Tuono Basin]], Jamis was distrustful of the outworlders and urged Stilgar to do his tribal duty - to eliminate those not trained to live with the desert. Although he agreed with Jamis regarding Jessica, Stilgar saw value in Paul. Unfortunately Jamis never realized the breadth of that value; he attributed Paul's disarming him at the moment Jessica overpowered Stilgar to "witch-force". Burning with resentment at being bested by a mere "child," Jamis invoked the [[Amtal Rule]] once they reached the [[Cave of Ridges]]. Unconvinced by Jessica's mystical performance, he demanded the right to test her part in the legend through [[Duel between Paul Atreides and Jamis|combat with]] her champion, Paul.

Jessica and Stilgar tried both persuasion and trickery to convince him otherwise, but Jamis persisted. Although Jamis was an expert with the [[crysknife]] in either hand, he was no match for one steeped in the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and trained by the likes of [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]]. He could have had no conception of the exquisite fineness of Paul's skill. Jamis' death bought Paul his sietch name, [[Usul]], and made him one of the [[Ichwan Bedwine]] with the manhood name of Paul-Muad'Dib. It was for Jamis that Paul 'Gave water to the dead', shedding a tear at his unnecessary death.

=== Legacy ===
Befitting a man of his standing, Jamis was given a full ritual funeral. Paul received Jamis' water, as was the custom, and inherited his [[yali]], or possessions (excluding the funeral gifts), and woman, Harah. Specifically, Paul received Jamis' [[coffee]] service and a bundle of [[Water Rings|water rings]], Stilgar's pick from the yali as his combat reward, and Paul himself chose Jamis' baliset, as it reminded him of his old teacher, [[Gurney Halleck|Gurney]]. The whole tribe rightly mourned Jamis' passing, for indeed, they all felt the loss on the unfortunate day that his temper drove him to challenge Paul Atreides. Jamis seemed to embody the best and worst of Fremen qualities: strength, superb fighting ability, desert wisdom, tribal loyalty, dedication to Fremen dreams and ideals, and closed-minded, bull-headed stubbornness.

'''''"The Songs of Muad'Dib"''''' by the [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan]] preserves for us the ''"Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain"'':

''Do you wrestle with dreams?''

''Do you contend with shadows?''

''Do you move in a kind of sleep?''

''Time has slipped away.''

''Your life is stolen.''

''You tarried with trifles,''

''Victim of your folly.''

'''Geoff''' was a [[Fremen]] of [[Sietch Tabr]]. He was the first husband of [[Harah]]. Geoff was called out and killed by [[Jamis]], who subsequently took Harah as his wife.

Together with Harah Geoff had a son, [[Kaleff]], whom Jamis took as his own, and made no distinction between him and his own son with Harah, [[Orlop]].

'''Kaleff''' was the son of [[Geoff]], a [[Fremen]] of [[Sietch Tabr]]. When Geoff was killed by [[Jamis]], Kaleff was taken by Jamis as his own son.

When Jamis was killed by [[Paul Atreides]], Kaleff, along with his half-brother, [[Orlop]], was taken into the Atreides household, with his mother [[Harah]], presumably where he remained.

Usul/DE
{{encyclopedia}}
'''Usul''' was a [[Fremen language|Fremen]] word meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar". It was also a figure of Fremen folklore that was later merged with the figure of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]].

==Legend==
Many legends existed about the life and deeds of Usul, both before and after the appearance of Paul Muad'dib.

According to a legend "How Muad'dib took his name", recorded in [[Ibarhimal-Yazizh]]'s ''[[Fremen Folktales from Onn]]'' SAH 313, Usul was "a King's son". 

In this version, Usul was still a boy when he decided to leave his [[sietch/DE|sietch]] before his ''[[minha]]'', the season of testing, as his mother reminded him. Nevertheless he left to the desert and as the sun was setting, he saw some little way off [[Kalatorano|a castle]] made all of sand. 

Inside the castle was a room, empty but for a table of sand on which stood a jug of [[liban]] and a bowl with some apricots and after he ate, he lay down to sleep. Then the voice of [[Alhen]] (Death), "Naib of All the Djinn" threatened him for entering his castle and eating his meal. 

Usul replied: ''"Jild an havy ma tumal minn-u harakis"'' (Shoes are not made of the hide of a living animal). Then the marid laughed and grabbed Usul by his hair and threw him into a pit in the center of the castle.

Usul sat at the bottom of the pit and a small mouse appeared and told him ''"Ya mawla, argab aanina!"''. Its wife gave birth and its tribe would starve without it, so it asked Usul to throw it over the pit. As Usul did this, the mouse replied ''"Tija al-sadaqa"'' "The gift will return to the giver" and Usul passed the rest of the night alone.

The next morning, the jinn grabbed Usul from his hair and threw him in the desert. 

===First djinn===
Then a mouse introduced as [[Mixabbi]] and advised Usul to learn from it. The mouse began to sniff the wind and to watch the spray of sand from the dune tops. Τhe mouse burrowed then stopped as the sand drifted down. When the mouse found the shadow of the wind, where the burrow did not collapse, it tunneled deeper and curled up inside with its nose deep inside its fur. 

The wind rose until before him there stood what seemed like a swirl of winds in the shape of a man, the Yellow Djinni [[Azfar]] who would eat Usul. Then following the mouse's example, he found the shadow of the wind on the lee side of a dune and crawled from place to place, testing the sand. When he found what the mouse had taught, he dug into the sand and
scooped himself a burrow. Usul waited until the storm blew itself out. 

Then Azfar told Usul that he won. If Usul ever became free, Azfar would do one service. 

===Second djinn===
When Usul tried to reply,  he foudn himself in a cavern. Then a mouse came, introduced as [[Rauhanin]] and showed him "peace": it hopped to the floor and crouched as if it were praying without moving no matter what Usul did. Thinking that the mouse was dead, put it on the floor again only to see it rise, shake itself, and run off as a distant rumble was heard until Usul's head rang. 

It was [[Ahmar]], the Red Djinni who would eat him. Usul thought he could bear no more of the loud beating, and fell to his knees, clutching his ears and grinding his teeth. Thinking of the mouse, he looked deeper and deeper inside of himself, for the small place where all is quiet. He looked and breathed from the center of his soul, and as he looked, he heard the drum less and less. Then he found the silent place, and rested there in reverence. 

Then, a pebble had fallen on him and Ahmar replied weakly and distantly when Usul becomes his own master, the djinni would do him a service. 
===Third djinn===
Usul found himself on an omnidirectional gray floor, stretching as far as he could see all round him, with a gray sky over all. Then a mouse came and introduced as [[Basbasiyah]]. It lept to the floor and began to wiggle its tail, hpping, jumping and dancing until Usul laughed. 

A drop of water fallen on his face and through moans and sad noises, from a dask cloud caame a sorrowful voice. It was [[Abiad]] the White Djinni that would eat him. He saw his mother and sister sorrowful for missing him. Usul started crying and feeling very sad and alone until remembered the mouse. He started laughing and before he knew it, the gray land was alive with his mirth and the echoes answered his laugh with giggles and chuckles. Then [[Abiad]] said that once he would free himself, he would not forget that Usul bested him.

Usul again found himself in the pit. It was night and once again fell to sleep. The morning Alhen again grabbed him and said that since Usul escaped his donkeys, whether he would do something to gain his freedom. But Usul would not ask anything. Then the Djinn asked from Usul [[portyguls]] from a garden. Usul said he would do it "but only because it pleases me to get some portyguls myself". 

As he left, he felt his own master again, and thought it was his ''[[al-awwal nahar]]'', for in wonders and adventures it has surely been 'the first day'. His [[hajra]] ended and he saw the garden, near sunrise.

He called [[Khala]], folk of the air to show him the portyguls. After he ate, he took three for the djinn, and then boasted that the garden is unguarded and any outcast would enter. The djinns replied that they were imprisoned there because he could not reach their hearth by nightfall. Then Usul realized he could not return to the same way because he would fail to return in time. 
===Return journey===
To that purpose he marked where the sun rose and set a course straight and fast for Alhen's castle. 

His path led him over a jagged rock wall, from which he looked at [[kaymus]], dust sand, in the basin. He ran down the slope, until he felt no ground and fell in a pit filled with ''[[bar almeda]]'' and sunk until could not breathe. Then he called Azfar. Since Usul was not free, the djinn asked for one of the portyguls. The djinn then lifted Usul from his cloak. Then a mouse came and Usul boasted. But the mouse replied "You had a djinni to help you. If a hawk should snatch me from a scorpion, that does not make the scorpion my slave nor the hawk my ally." 

As he crossed a low range of dunes. He stepped steadily across the salt basin, heading for a ridge of rock on the far side. When he came to the very middle of the place, he felt [[drum sand]] and this [[atambal]] would call a worm. The drum sand would give him firm footing, he knew, and he judged the distance to the rocks carefully. He then asked help from Ahmar. The djinn asked him for a portygul because he was not free, and with his drum he sped, luring the [[sandworm/DE|sandworm]]. Usul made his way to the rocks and sat down to catch his breath. Then a mouse came to whom Usul boasted but it replied "Make sure when you cross the desert you always have Ahmar's drum at your call and no worms will bother you." 

Usul thought as he proceeded that while he had not beaten the uncaring earth nor the greedy worm, and he was thirsty. 
Usul lay flat on the desert sands, too weak to move. Two mice came and talked about him. They said that this boy was not Usul master of Dune because he is not his own master. Then he called Abiad, to weep and slake his thirst. Once more, the djinn noted that Usul is not free.

But Usul replied that he is free because it's to his will to bear or to bow, to endure or to submit, and the mightiest
naib can say no more. If I were to die in chains, I will still have a freedom that no one can take from him.

The djinn again asked for a portygul as a reward but Usul said no, because he would eat it himself; he did not intend to return to Alhen.

Once he found himself in the pit with the djinn angry, since Usul broke his promise. But then, Usul gave him the portygul he still held. The djinn then realized it was bested and offered him anything, even the whole [[Arrakis/DE|planet]]. Usul denied saying that the djinn "can give me nothing that I lack or cannot get for myself". 

He took only a gift himself would give. A name: the name of his preceptors, whose teaching brought him through all troubles. The new name shall be called 'Mouse'.

==Paul Atreides==
It was the name given to [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] when he was given sanctuary with [[Sietch Tabr]] by its [[naib/DE|naib]], [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]]. Openly Paul was to be referred to as [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]]. However, Usul was the private name used within the Sietch. It was to be the name his beloved [[Chani/DE|Chani]] would use for him, and the last word she cried before she died giving birth to their children.

Stilgar gave Paul this name after witnessing him defeat one of their finest wariors, [[Jamis]]. It would appear that Stilgar saw a certain strength in the boy.

Ishmael
{{Expanded}}{{Character_infobox|name=Ishmael|birth=[[211 BG]]|birthplace=[[Poritrin]]|title=*[[Naib]] of the [[Wormrider]]s|family=*[[El'hiim]] (stepson)|debut=[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]|book name=[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]|loyalty=*[[Zensunni]]
**[[Free Men of Arrakis]]
***[[Freemen of Arrakis]]}}

'''Naib Ishmael''' [b. [[211 BG]]] was the [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] who formed the [[Free Men of Dune|Free Men of Arrakis]] from both slave refugees from [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]] and the outlaws of the late [[Selim Wormrider]], and became the first [[Naib]] of the Free Men. Later, he led the portion of the Free Men who became known as [[Freemen of Dune]] and later [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] into the deep desert. 

== History ==

===Slavery on Poritrin===
When he was only about 10 years old, he witnessed the arrival of [[Tlulaxa]] [[slavers]] [[Tlulaxa raid on Harmonthep|assaulting]] his village. He and his cousin [[Taina]] were captured and taken to [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]]. Initially he worked in the slimy mudflats of [[Isana]], scooping clam seedlings and rushing them out into the wet fields.

Soon he was moved to the mansion of [[Tio Holtzman]] and entered his team of [[solvers]]; he became friends with the unruly [[Aliid]] who was a [[Zenshiite]]. Aliid proposed him to make a prank by deliberately entering wrong mathematical formulas. Fortunately, the mistakes were detected by Holtzman who then punished his solvers.

Ishmael was transferred in a slave team that constructed a giant mosaic in a canyon wall of the [[Isana]] river. During the rebellion of [[Bel Moulay]], he and Aliid destroyed their own work on the mosaic, and then punished by whipping. The rebellion was soon quieted down and the two boys watched Bel Moulay's cruel execution, and was remembered for the years to come.

Years later, Ishmael had a wife, [[Ozza]], who gave him two daughters, [[Chamal]] and [[Falina]]. Ishmael grew with docile belief, remembering nostalgically the sutras and stories told to him by his grandfather. He recited them to his co-slaves, gave them courage and strengthened their faith, although the more defiant, Aliid, used to scorn his meekness.

Ishmael worked constructing the decoy fleet that fooled the machines during their [[attack against Poritrin]], and idea by [[Vorian Atreides]] that saved the planet. Moved by Aliid and others who demanded recognition for their labor and better living conditions, Ishmael audaciously attempted to meet and talk with Lord [[Niko Bludd]] personally. Because of his disrespect, he was separated from his family taken to work for [[Norma Cenva/XD|Norma Cenva]] with other 130 slaves.

During that time, Ishmael continued to preach and tell stories to the Zensunni comrades who came to him. The Zensiites with Aliid rested on different quarters. After some years, among a new batch of 30 slaves, Ishamel recognized his daughter, Chamal (with her husband [[Rafel]]) who were also taken to work for Cenva.
===Escape to Arrakis===
Soon, Ishmael learned of Aliid's and the Zenshiite's plot to revolt on the 28th anniversary of the rebellion on Poritrin. Ishmael was a pacifist, and preached non-violence - giving hope to other slaves by telling them that God will grant them freedom if they are patient.

During Aliid's slave revolt, Ishmael with the help of Rafel and others, forced [[Tuk Keedair]] to take his band of slaves to freedom. Keedair made sure to warn them that he is no pilot and the only coordination he remembered was of [[Arrakis]]. Eventually, using the [[space-folding]] technology, they arrived on the desert planet and crashed on the sand.

The slaves soon realized the world was hostile, with scarce moisture, no vegetation and poor fauna, under a hot sun. Several scouting attempts resulted in tragedy. After five months of waiting, 1/3 of the slaves were dead.

Then, [[Jafar]] found them, hearing the claims of Tuk Keedair about the lost slaves, and came to find them. He accepted them to the band of the [[Wormrider]] outlaws after the death of [[Selim Wormrider]] and the Poritrin slaves joined their population.

Ishmael met Selim's widow, [[Marha]], who indoctrinated the ideals of Selim. Ishmael took care of her son, [[El'hiim]], and even saved his life when it was endangered by [[Scorpion]]s in the desert. Eventually Ishmael and Marha felt a mutual attraction and they were joined in marriage. Around that time Ishmael became the [[Naib]] of the Wormriders' village

In the following years Marha died. El'hiim insisted that she would receive treatment from scientists of the [[Arrakis City]], but Ishmael, having now adopted the ideals of Selim, denied to trust the offworlders. Marha had listened to her husband and In El'hiim's view that had led directly to her death. Marha made Ishmael swear to shelter and advise her son.

===Selim and El'hiim===
When El'hiim grew up. he became the Naib of the [[Wormrider]]s but his stepfather perhaps had applied too much pressure, unwittingly forcing him to turn in another direction. El'hiim but was changed by the new experiences and was radically different than his father. To Ishmael's dismay, the young Naib trusted offworlders and insisted that they should buy commodities by trading spice.

Ishmael often scorned his stepson about their conflicting views, but respected his position as the Naib. Eventually the village was assaulted by [[slavers]] but they were repelled successfully.

Ishmael decided to re-educate El'hiim. They both went to a pilgrimage in the [[Tanzerouft]] riding a [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]], and make him remember the wild way of living on Arrakis. However on their return home, they found their village devastated by slavers who returned during their absence, kidnapping several young men and women. The young Naib realized from a fabric tissue that the attackers were from [[Zanbar]] and knew where they were.

El'hiim traveled to Arrakis City where the authorities promised to enforce certain regulations against kidnapping. Not trusting the word of the outsiders, Ishmael organised a meeting of the Zensunnis at their main settlement in the faraway cliffs. Accompanided by a reluctant El'hiim, they reached the slavers' camp; they counted about a dozen. After disabling the lighting with [[maula rifle]]s, they fell on them with their crystal and wormtooth [[knives]]. During the fray, Ishmael caught [[Wariff]], the unrepentant [[Tlulaxa]] man who saved years ago. Ishmael remembered the words of his aggressive friend Aliid and started to endorse them; he commanded his men to seek payment in blood and return it to the desert as water.

Following the successful kanla raid, Ishmael and El'hiim argued about Ishmael's violent attack on the slavers, particularly the draining of their enemies' blood to take their water. While El'hiim preferred trade and contact with offworlders, Ishmael advocated returning to the ways of Selim Wormrider and retreating to the deepest deserts. Unable to reconcile their differences, Ishmael challenged his adopted son to a duel and disowned him, slapping him twice as with the custom to invoke deep insult. With El'hiim unwilling to fight him, Ishmael demanded a sandworm duel. 

During the sandworm duel, Ishmael and El'hiim charged their sandworms at each other. However, the duel ended in El'hiim's favor when Ishmael lost control of his sandworm, allowing El'hiim's sandworm to gain the upper hand and drive his sandworm away. Having lost the leadership of the clan, a defeated Ishmael led several Zensunni supporters from El'hiim's village into the dangerous Tanzerouft desert. There, he and his followers vowed to build their own isolated settlements and avoid contact with outsiders.

*[[Iduali]] (formerly)|image=Javid.jpg}}

'''High Priest Ziarenko Javid''' [d. [[10219 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] follower of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|"Muad'Dib"]] [[House Atreides|Atreides]], who was the High Priest of the [[Qizarate]] following the execution of the treacherous [[Korba]]. In his later years he became the lover of his sister, [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]].

== Biography ==
Javid was born in [[Sietch Jacurutu]] as the son of its [[Naib]], [[Namri]]. He was trained by his father to one day become one of the [[Water Stealers|water stealers]], but Javid left his father and the [[Iduali]] of Jacurutu, joining the [[Priesthood of Muad'Dib]] and rising to the [[Qizarate]], becoming High Priest in [[10210 AG]] after the execution of the previous High Priest, Korba, for his involvement in the [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|last conspiracy]] against the Emperor. 

In the last years of her regency, the [[ego-memory]] sceptre of the deceased [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] suggested that the Regent Alia take him as a lover. Soon after their relationship began, [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]], a [[Mentat]]-[[ghola]] and Alia's husband, surmised the affair and this severely angered him. During the revolt of the Naibs, Duncan killed Javid publicly in [[Sietch Tabr]], both as revenge and in an attempt to force the hand of Tabr Naib [[Stilgar]]. Indeed, his death provoked Stilgar to abandon his position of neutrality between Alia and the rebel Fremen by killing Duncan in turn.
==Behind the scenes==
The 2003 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'' indicates that Javid was still in league with the members of [[Sietch Jacurutu]] in his time as High Priest. He was also seen during the events of ''Dune Messiah'' as a child, helping Korba set the stoneburner.

'''Korba''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] follower of [[Paul Atreides|Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides]], the supposed [[Mahdi]]. Beginning his rise to power as one of the original [[Fedaykin]] who Paul trained in the [[Weirding Way]] during the [[Desert War]], he served as a commander in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]] which allowed Paul to usurp [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and become the [[Padishah Emperor]] and led to the Fremen waging [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a twelve-year galactic jihad]] in his name. 

After the Battle of Arrakeen, Korba was given the title of Panegyrist, becoming an important member of Paul's [[Qizarate]] and rose to the additional title of [[High Priest]] by the year [[10208 AG]]. It was at this point that Korba turned against his Mahdi, becoming embroiled in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a conspiracy]] to martyr the Emperor, a conspiracy whose leading instigators also included Princess [[Irulan Corrino]], Paul's wife in name only, [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Spacing Guild]] [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], and [[Scytale]], a [[Face Dancer]]. Korba was killed by [[Stilgar]] after his complicity in the conspiracy was discovered.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In the TV miniseries adaption of Children of Dune, Korba was portrayed by Czech actor Karel Dobrý, who also portrayed Liet Kynes in the original Dune miniseries. The motivation of Korba is altered in the miniseries so instead of a desire to martyr him so his religious power would increase drastically, Korba is a rebel hating the Atreides Empire. He is also seen to be a friend of the child Javid.

In the 1984 movie, it is speculated that the character Korba, who speaks the line at min 93.45 "If you be a Reverend Mother, let Shai-hulud judge now!" was played by Dennis Hopper in an uncredited role.

Pardot Kynes
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Pardo_&_Liet.jpg|thumb]]


'''Pardot Kynes''' [d. 10175 AG] was an Imperial [[Planetologist]] who studied [[Arrakis]]. He remained there and married a native [[Fremen]] woman, with whom he had his only child, [[Liet Kynes]].

Kynes was the first to be sent to study Arrakis, perhaps by [[Elrood Corrino IX]]. For Kynes, the planet was an expression of its [[Canopus|sun]]'s energy, ready to be reshaped

==Meeting with the Fremen==

[[File:Screenshot_2019-07-26-03-08-39-1.png|thumb]]

His opportunity to shape the planet came when he was exploring the landscape in a one-man [[groundcar]] behind the [[Shield Wall]], near the village of [[Windsack]], one hot afternoon when he stumbled onto six [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] bravos, [[shield]]ed and fully armed, bullying 3 [[Fremen]] youths. It was a common scene, more slapstick than real, but Kynes realized that the bullies intended to kill the boys; one was down with a severed artery, two of the bravos were down, but it was still four armed men against two.

Kynes triggered his own shield, waded in and had silently had two of the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip. He dodged a [[sword]] thrust, slit the third's throat with a neat entrisseur, and the remaining Harkonnen was felled by the two Fremen youths, as he saved the lad on the ground.

The Fremen were confused; he was a known Imperial servant, but was also an ally. The inexperienced youths by two days later, took him to Windshack owing him a mortal obligation. There he talked to the Fremen about water, grass, about palmaries filled with date palms and open qanats flowing across the desert.

Kynes never saw the behind-the-scenes debate raging all around him. He knew the location of a major sietch and talked like a madman, he was a water burden for the sietch and also a servant of the Imperium. He did kill Harkonnens but anyone had; he just saved three fool youths and had seen [[crysknives]]. Eventually the [[tau]] of the sietch voiced the decision.

Kynes was talking to a group that spread around him about open water, walking in the open without [[stillsuit]]s, and [[portyguls]], when [[Uliet]], an experienced fighter, was sent with a consecrated [[knife]] to kill him, with two [[watermen]] to get his water from the body. Kynes said "Remove yourself" to Uliet who stood before him, and went on talking about secret [[windtrap]]s, brushing past the man opening his for his ceremonial blow.

Uliet inexplicably, in a riddling gesture, perhaps motivated by Kynes' visionary words, walked three paces and deliberately fell on his own knife, thus "removing" himself.
=== Terraforming Arrakis ===


[[File:Pardotkynes.png|thumb|Pardot Kynes, by Dev Pramanik and Alex Guimarães, House Atreides Graphic novel ]]


This was taken to be a sign by the Fremen that Kynes was to be listened to. Eventually, most Fremen took to Kynes' vision for Arrakis' future. Kynes returned to his Imperial post, directing the [[Biological Testing Station]] bringing Fremen as personnel, stealing tools like [[cutteray]]s, used to dig underground [[catchbasin]]s and hidden windtraps and collect water in the basins.

Kynes was hailed as an [[umma]], a prophet. Men, women and children went anywhere he ordered, and many died during their "missions". He set up small-unit experiments with regular interchange of data for a swift [[Tansley effect]], accumulating millions of tiny information. He organized only isolated and rough run-through tests to put their difficulties into perspective.

Kynes had the Fremen collect copious amounts of data on the climate, biology and ecosystems of the planet. Through his research, [[sandtrout]] were discovered. Indeed, it was through the sandtrout that Kynes learned the relationship between the spice and [[Shai-hulud]].

After discovering how melange was created, Pardot Kynes turned his attention to planting greenery. First he began with a certain [[poverty grass]], then moved to others including:
* [[Poverty grass]]
* Ephemerals - [[chenopods]], [[pigweed]]s, [[amarinth]]
* [[Scotch broom]]
* [[Low lupine]]
* [[Vine eucalyptus]] (from [[Caladan]])
* [[Dwarf tamarisk]]
* [[Shore pine]]
* [[Candelilla]]
* [[Suguaro]]
* [[Bis-naga]]
* Shrubs and bushes, including [[camel sage]], [[onion grass]], [[gobi feather grass]], [[wild alfalfa]], [[burrow Bush]], [[sand verbena]], [[evening primrose]], [[incense bush]], [[smoke tree]], [[creosote bush]].

Following this, Kynes then introduced various animals, including:
* Burrowing animals: [[kit fox]], [[kangaroo mouse]], [[desert hare]], [[sand terrapin]]
* Predators, including the [[desert hawk]], [[dwarf owl]], [[eagle]], [[desert owl]]
* Insects, namely [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], [[trapdoor spider]], [[biting wasp]], [[wormfly]]
* The [[desert bat]]

Once Kynes saw the introduction of all these forms of life, he then began to plant more than two hundred different food plants, including [[cotton]], [[melon]]s, [[coffee]] and [[medicinal]]s.

Kynes married into a Fremen sietch and had a son, [[Liet Kynes]] whom he taught (along with the other Fremen children) ecology and the "language" of Arrakis, of its landscape, climate, seasonal limits, and finally how to break through all ideas of force into the awareness of order.

===Death===
However, he was killed in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] when Liet was nineteen. Liet continued his father's work, both in an official capacity as Imperial Planetologist, but also as Fremen leader, steering them as a people toward an ultimate goal, one that Pardot Kynes had envisioned would take approximately five hundred years. This plan, however, was interrupted and dramatically quickened by the arrival of [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]].

==Character==
Kynes was a direct and simple man in many ways. His single-mindedness was enormous, and approached any problem with a kind of innocence, but not naïveté; he merely permitted himself no distractions. Thus, he often appeared somewhat emotionless, but was kind and helpful nonetheless. His son Liet inherited both his mother's Fremen nature and his father's ecological talent and thus he was more emotional than Pardot.

Farok
{{Original}}

[[File:Farok.png|thumb]]

'''Farok''' was a [[Fremen]] from [[Sietch Tabr]]. He was one of the [[Fedaykin]].

During [[Muad'dib's Jihad]], Farok became [[Bashar ]]of the Ninth Legion and fought on a number of worlds including [[Enfeil]], where he led his legion to victory, and [[Naraj]], where his son was blinded by a [[stone burner]].

Later, Farok was killed by [[Scytale]] shortly before he took [[Lichna]]'s identity

{{encyclopedia}}

It is mentioned that after the final victory on [[Molitor]] he and other [[Fremen/DE]] warriors celebrated in a great feast in [[Paul's Keep/DE]] and his first-hand account is quoted in the ''Encyclopedia''.<ref>Arrakeen Palace</ref>
==Behind the Scenes==
===Discrepancies===
Farok is initially described with a missing arm: "Scytale returned his gaze to the old man [Farok], noted the empty sleeve dangling from the left shoulder and the lack of a stillsuit." Only a few paragraphs later, however, Farok has mysteriously regained his arm: ""Thrice blessed," Farok said, folding his hands into his lap in the ritual clasp. They were old, heavily veined hands."

This has given rise to a running joke within the Dune fandom that Farok did in fact have ''three'' arms.
===In Other Media===
Farok was portrayed by Ivo Novák in the 2003 [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]] miniseries.

Warrick
{{Expanded}}

[[File:Fremen-cabalgusanos-by-aaron-miller.jpg|thumb|Fremen Wormrider by Aaron Miller]]

'''Warrick''' was a [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] from [[Red Wall Sietch]], the blood-brother of [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]] and first husband of [[Faroula]]. Friends from early childhood, Warrick accompanied Liet Kynes, on many of the routine and everyday occurrences that Liet experienced as a teenager. 

==Dominic Vernius==
As the two grew into men, they discovered the hidden hideout of the former [[Earl]] [[Dominic Vernius]] who had established an underground base on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]' [[Southern Polar Region]]. Discovered by the Earl's men while delivering the annual [[melange/XD|melange]] tribute to the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]], Warrick and Liet were led before the renegade nobleman. The exiled leader of [[House Vernius]] agreed to spare the lives of the young duo, and Warrick and Liet agreed to help the help Dominic better hide his base. Released by Vernius, Warrick and his close friend never told of the Antarctic location.

==Marriage to Faroula==
As the two progressed into adulthood, their eyes were caught by a young Fremen women named Faroula, daughter of the [[Naib]] of their sietch. Liet confided in Warrick that he had written poetry about Faroula, but the ever confident Warrick sadly stated that Liet would probably never share the words with her. Warrick further re-iterated that he, too, was interested in the teen Fremen maiden. Finally, Faroula issued a marriage challenge to both, including Warrick, leaving them a note in each of their quarters, that she could be found in the far away [[Cave of Birds]]. The first of the two young males to find her, would be her betrothed.

Warrick summoned a Giant [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]],and used his [[Maker hooks]] to guide the beast across the sands of [[Dune]]. Warrick arrived at the Cave just a few moments earlier than Liet did, and as Warrick and Faroula pledged their lives to each other, Liet slowly turned around, and did not interrupt his friend's tender moment.

==The Coriolis Storm==
Liet left the Sietch soon afterwards, embittered about his loss of the hand of Faroula, and headed for the Antarctic regions of the planet. Warrick and Faroula were formally married soon afterward, and within a year, their son, [[Liet-chih]] was born. A few months later, Liet gave word to the Sietch that he was returning to his extended family. Liet gave word to Warrick, and told him to meet him in the Southern Polar Region. Warrick was overjoyed, and the two had a short-lived reunion.

On the way back to their ancient homestead, a fierce [[Coriolis storm]] began to come near them from faroff in the desert. The sandworm that they were riding fled deep into the sand as the giant storm approached. A small out-cropping of rock, only big enough for one man, was the only shelter that the duo could find. The two lifelong friends struggled as to whom should use the rock shelter, as the other would almost certainly die, due to being exposed to the fercious sand winds. Warrick debated that Liet should use the shelter, as he was the son of [[Umma]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]]. Liet demanded that Warrick use the shelter, as he had a wife and child to take care of. As neither would "take no for an answer", and the storm was almost upon them, they left their fate to chance, to throwing [[stick]]s. Warrick cast first, and rolled a score of seven; Liet acquired a nine. As the two argued still further, the storm came upon them, and Warrick pushed Liet into the enclosure.

==The Water of Life==
Warrick was critically wounded and blinded, the skin scoured from his face and parts of his body, and Liet took him back to the Sietch. Warrick chose to drink the [[Water of Life]] in an attempt to discover more about the [[Lisan al Gaib]] and died in the process.

'''Leto Atreides II''' ([[10210 AG]] - [[Timeline (Original Dune)|13728 AG]]) was the third and last ruler of the [[Atreides Empire]] as [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] and the first and only [[God Emperor]] from [[10219 AG]] until his assassination in [[13728 AG]], when his intergalactic empire began to break up into a loose federation ruled by various powerful groups.  

Leto was born on Arrakis to then-Padishah Emperor [[Paul Atreides]] and his [[Fremen]] [[concubine]] [[Chani Kynes]], the daughter of the great [[Liet Kynes]], just after his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides]]. He and his sister were preborn due to Chani's consumption of the spice melange in large amounts before her death. He was named after the [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]], his paternal grandfather, and [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], his older brother, who was murdered in infancy.

Seeing that their aunt, the [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], had been possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of her grandfather [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Leto II and Ghanima planned to prevent her from destroying the Atreides and preventing the [[Golden Path]], the salvation of humanity which Leto worked to bring about for most of his life. This period also saw them evade an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]] which resulted in the banishment of [[Wensicia Corrino]] by her son [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]], who became Ghanima's lover. Following Alia's suicide as well as the murder of his father Paul, Leto took the title of God Emperor and ruled over humanity with an iron fist for 3,500 years, guiding it away from extinction. 

==Biography==
===Upbringing {{C|10210-10219}}===
Leto II and his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] were born on planet [[Arrakis]] at the end of the reign of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]]. Their mother [[Chani]] died shortly after giving birth to the two children, mainly due to complications arising from large amounts of contraceptives that were surreptitiously given to her by Paul's legal wife [[Irulan Corrino]]. Paul had anticipated the birth of a daughter, Ghanima, due to his prescient visions. However, Leto's arrival came as a surprise to the [[Emperor]]. Both children were [[pre-born]].

Following Chani's death, and the apparent death of their father in the desert of Arrakis, Leto and his sister became the legal responsibility of Paul's younger sister, the regent Alia. Though they were granted a fine upbringing, little attention was bestowed upon them by their aunt, who was possessed by [[Abomination]] and enthralled by her own power and the mysticism developed around the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] name by Paul.

====Evolution on Arrakis ====
[[Image:GodEmperorofDune-LetoWorm.jpg|thumb|left|Leto II as a worm]]
When they were nine years old, Leto and Ghanima gained the attention of their paternal grandmother, [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], who returned to Arrakis from [[Caladan]] to inspect them as part of her obligations to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her [[Fremen]] allies to help protect them.

At this same time, Leto's prescient powers began to emerge. Through visions and intuition, he discovered the [[Golden Path]] that his father had earlier uncovered and begun to follow. However, unlike Paul, Leto developed a greater understanding of the Golden Path's implications. He sensed not only its dangers but also the painful steps that had to be taken to avoid it unraveling, which would be to the peril of humankind.

Leto and Ghanima escaped an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]]. The two split up, with Ghanima conditioned to believe her brother was dead so that if she were to be interrogated on his whereabouts, she would not be able to tell the truth. Leto slipped into almost total anonymity, using the time and relative seclusion to build a foundation of power and knowledge through which the full impact of the Golden Path could be realized. To enact such steps required a strong (almost brutal) grip on power and longevity that would override the shortsightedness and impatience of Man.

Thus, after spending time amongst a variety of fringe [[Fremen]] elements, including [[The Preacher]], Leto accepted [[sand trout]] upon his body and began the conversion into a human-sandworm hybrid. This transformation (which, in the beginning, was essentially a form of [[wikipedia:Exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]), boosted Leto's strength, reflexes, and speed immensely, and he was able to move across large distances on foot.

====Ascendancy to Emperor====
After his transformation had progressed to a sufficient stage, Leto emerged from the desert and returned to the city of [[Arrakeen]] to confront the possessed Alia and claim the throne of the empire.  After Alia managed to briefly overcome her possession and take her own life, Leto claimed the title of Padishah "God" Emperor and promptly married his sister to consolidate his hegemony. The marriage was purely legal. Ghanima accepted [[Farad'n Corrino]] as her mate, but their descendants would be known as Atreides. The same year, Leto began writing his diaries, which would later be known as the [[Stolen Journals]]. 

===Early years as God Emperor {{C|10219-12335}}===
Shortly after his ascendancy, Leto ordered a new ghola of [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]] from the Bene Tleilax to serve him as Commander of the Royal Guard, as the original [[Hayt]] ghola had been killed by the Fremen [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] during the last days of Alia's regency. During the earliest years of his reign, Leto used the existing Fremen forces as well as Farad'n's [[Sardaukar]] troops, which he had given to him upon his ascension to the throne, to enforce his rule. His armies of Fremen and Sardaukar were commanded by a series of Idaho gholas, which would usually be replaced after they tried to kill him and he killed them in response, although very occasionally he allowed them to have natural deaths.

Over the centuries, Leto's empire, which he ruled as the God Emperor, became multigalactic through gradual growth. Very early on in this expansion, Leto suppressed the ancient Order of Mentats and banned the training of Mentats because they formed a nucleus of independent opposition.

====Death of Ghanima====
While Leto lived on for millenia, his sister and wife Ghanima, being but a mortal human woman, died after a relatively normal life in the first years of Leto's rule. After told of her death, Leto, heartbroken, wrote this in his journals:

{{Quote|The sand beach as grey as a dead cheek, a green tideflow reflects cloud ripples; I stand on the dark wet edge. Cold foam cleanses my toes. I smell driftwood smoke.|Leto's journals|God Emperor of Dune}}
He pressed a strand of Ghanima's hair, with a starflower blossom which she once brought to him, between these pages of the journals.

====The [[Fish Speaker|Fish Speakers]]====
While for centuries the Fremen and Sardaukar legions were enough for Leto, he ultimately decided that these forces were unsuitable to his needs. Leto believed that male dominated military forces were essentially predatory and would turn against the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy, whereas a female one would tame and calm. He also needed a reliable religious organization to enforce what was coming to be known as [[Leto's Peace]] to ensure the unfolding of the Golden Path. Because of this, he founded a new all-female army to serve him, commanded by the continuing series of Duncan Idahos.

Leto named the army the "Fish Speakers" because the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams.  Although the Fish Speakers were all female, males were still employed as house guards, and their commander Idaho was male. With the exception of the nomadic Amazons who legend described as once ruling part of the Asian steppes of [[Earth|Old Earth]], the Fish Speakers were just about the only effective all-female army known throughout the history of the universe. They were also, in terms of worlds ruled and historical longevity, the most effective military force ever known.

====Burning of the Nine Historians====
In his 2,116th year as the God Emperor, the famed Nine Historians came to Leto's attention. The historians angered Leto, for they had lied in their works, and he thought they deserved to be punished. On his orders, they were rendered unconscious, then burned on pyres of their own published works. Not one of them felt the flames, and they died peacefully. When Leto was petitioned by other historians seeking word of their fellows, he said:

{{Quote|They were destroyed because they lied pretentiously. Have no fear that my wrath will fall upon you because of your innocent mistakes. I am not overly fond of creating martyrs. Martyrs tend to set dramatic events adrift in human affairs. Drama is one of the targets of my predation. Tremble only if you build false accounts and stand pride-fully upon them. Go now and do not speak of this.|Leto II to the historians|God Emperor of Dune}}
Rumors of this spread across the Empire in the years that followed, through accounts which were later judged by the Bene Gesserit to have originated with Leto himself through his majordomo [[Ikonicre]].<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', page 70</ref>

===Last days {{C|13650-13728}}===
====Suppression of Wallach IX====
In the 3,431st year of Leto's reign, he learned through prescience of the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on Wallach IX. He sent Duncan Idaho to extinguish the School in order to enforce his ban of the Order, but some of the Mentat-Sisters escaped, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood.

====Visit of Sisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko====
Bene Gesserit Sisters Quintinius Violet Chenoeh and Tawsuoko came to Arrakis in the 3,507th year of Leto's reign to confirm the long-suspected execution of the Nine Historians. Sister Chenoeh was invited to accompany the Fish Speakers in an entourage which accompanied one of Leto's infrequent peregrinations. At one point, she was invited to trot behind the Royal Cart and converse with the God Emperor himself. He told Chenoeh to tell the Sisterhood that he would "resore the outward view" and that the Bene Gesserit of all people should know the dangers of breeding for a particular characteristic, of seeking a defined genetic goal. Leto also told her things which she did not include in her report to the Sisterhood - thoughts on how he would be remembered, but also the statement that he would never see her again because she would not live to become a Reverend Mother. His predictions came true, as Chenoeh died in the Spice Agony due to melange incombatiblity.

====Events leading up to the assassination====
=====Final failed assassination attempt by Duncan Idaho=====
A year after Chenoeh's death, the latest Duncan Idaho ghola made the last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life by a Duncan after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him. After tracing the lasgun back to the Ixian Ambassador, Iyo Kobat, Leto ordered Kobat to leave Arrakis, deciding not to kill him because he was too unimportant. Instead, he told him to carry a message to Ix that the God Emperor knew about the agreement between Ix and the Spacing Guild. Leto also gave Kobat a private message for his masters that he wanted an extension for his cart, and that they were to send him a large supply of ridulian crystal paper.

Soon after, Leto sensed the need for the next step on the Golden Path and knew that his rule must end for further progress to occur. Thus Leto used [[Siona Atreides]], a distant descendant of Ghanima and Farad'n, and yet another replacement Duncan Idaho ghola created by the scheming Tleilaxu after the failed assassination. With them, he sowed the seed of the Atreides genes for future generations. 

=====Assassination attempt by the Bene Tleilax=====
During this period, the Bene Tleilax attempted to kill Leto during his progression in the Royal Cart across the Idaho River with his majordomo Moneo Atreides, the newest Duncan Idaho ghola and an entourage of Fish Speakers. Face Dancers approached the group disguised as Museum Fremen (the remnants of the old Fremen of the desert days) before all transforming into a copy of Duncan, each having also obtained uniforms identical to those worn by Idaho. Their hope was to confuse the Fish Speakers into not knowing which Duncan to obey and to kill the God Emperor in the confusion. This failed, however, when Duncan took off his uniform, and so the Fish Speakers knew to obey the commands of the naked Duncan as they fought the Face Dancers. After this incident, he had the Tleilaxu Ambassador publically flogged and expelled.

=====Assassination attempt by the Bene Gesserit=====
Also in the months leading up to the God Emperor's death, two Reverend Mothers and Truthsayers, Tertius Eileen Anteac (who was also one of the Mentats trained on Wallach IX) and Marcus Claire Luyseyal, came to Arrakis. They were warned about the upcoming assassination attempt by the Tleilaxu by Othwi Yake, the assistant to former Ixian ambassador Iyo Kobat, the man who had supplied the weapon Leto's most recent Duncan Idaho had used to try and kill the God Emperor, but their message to him arrived only after the assassination had already failed, because the captain of the Fish Speaker guard would not believe them. Anteac and Luyseyal were granted an audience with Leto, however, at the end of which he agreed to continue the spice allotment of the Sisterhood at its current level for the next decade despite a further attempt at assassination using spice essence by the Sisters.

=====Hwi Noree and death of Malky=====
Leto fell in love with the new Ixian Ambassador [[Hwi Noree]]. Hwi was a direct female clone of Leto's former friend and advisor [[Malky]] created by the Tleilaxu in an Ixian [[no-chamber]]. Since Hwi was conceived and raised outside of his [[prescience|prescient]] abilities, Leto was unaware of her until she was presented to him as an ambassador. Leto was instantly smitten with Noree, and within a few months proposed marriage to her, and set the date of betrothal. After the announcement that Leto and Hwi were to wed, Hwi's uncle Malky was recalled to Arrakis by Leto, and murdered by Moneo after a last personal discussion with his old friend.

====The assassination====
A few weeks later, Leto, Hwi, and Moneo lost their lives when Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by her assistant, [[Nayla]]. They all fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]]. 

{{Quote|Do not fear the Ixians. They can make the machines, but they no longer can make arafel. I know. I was there.|Leto's last words|God Emperor of Dune}}
In dying, he released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise. 

===Legacy===
{{Quote|I will die four deaths - the death of the flesh, the death of the soul, the death of the myth, and the death of reason. And all of these deaths contain the seeds of resurrection.|Leto cryptically explains his death and legacy|God Emperor of Dune}}
During and after his reign, Leto II was viewed as an extremely controversial figure. Following Leto's death, a chain of dramatic events took place over a span of 1,500 years. This included the [[Famine Times]], [[the Scattering]], and the recreation of the [[sandworm]]s on [[Arrakis]], which emerged from the [[sandtrout]] that escaped from Leto's body when he fell into the water. Many of the established power brokers who existed at the start of his rule were either destroyed or significantly weakened, due to his draconian tactics and a monopoly on the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. To his admirers, Leto II was known as the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], but to his enemies (including the [[Bene Gesserit]]) he was labeled [[the Tyrant]] of the [[known universe]]. He was worshipped by the Bene Tleilax as the Prophet of God after his death. 

The religion of the God Emperor also continued on Dune, which became known as Rakis. He was worshipped by the priests of the new Church of the Divided God, which became the dominant force on Rakis and had essential control of the planet, as the great Divided God and the third member of the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven, the other being his grandmother Jessica, and his father, Muad'Dib. It was also believed by the Priests of Rakis that he had carried within him the spirit of his brother, Leto II the Elder. This worship continued until the [[Battle of Rakis|attack on the planet]] by the [[Honored Matres]] and also with those returned to the Old Empire from the Scattering, who called Leto II Dur or [[Guldur]].

====Living on in the sandworms====
It was also said that within each sandworm that grew on Arrakis after his death, a pearl of his consciousness existed. This theory was supported when,  1,500 years after his death, an Arrakeen girl named [[Sheeana]], who was a direct descendant of Siona and Duncan Idaho who later became the youngest ever Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, displayed the power to control the worms.

==Name==
===Etymology===
'''Leto Atreides II''' was named after his paternal grandfather, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]], and his deceased brother [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]]. Due to his brother [[Stiros]] of the [[Church of the Divided God]] called him '''Leto III''' rather than '''Leto II''', but was argued with by [[Hedley Tuek]], who told him that the spirit of the older Leto had been reborn in the younger.

Those who worshipped him on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] called him the '''Great God Dur''', meaning "Great God of Darkness", or '''Guldur''', signifying black magic. 

===Titles===
During his reign and later Leto was commonly known by his title of '''God Emperor''', but after his death he was more commonly called the '''Tyrant''', predominantely by the [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]], who also referred to him as the '''Worm''', '''Worm God''', or '''Old Worm'''. The Bene Tleilax, on the other hand, privately called him the '''Prophet''' or '''Prophet of God''' due to their belief that he was a prophet of their god. 

==Trivia==
*It is possible that the design of the God-Emperor of Mankind, a major character from the ''Warhammer 40,000'' tabletop game franchise, was influenced by Leto Atreides II. The two share strong psychic abilities, are practically immortal, bear the title of "God Emperor", rule over a political body known as "The Imperium", guide mankind towards survival, rule with an iron fist, and are the center of a vast imperial cult. In addition, large sections of the background material of ''Warhammer 40,000 ''in general are seemingly influenced by the ''Dune ''novels.
*In the books, Paul anticipated the birth of Ghanima, but not Leto's. In the 2003 Children of Dune miniseries, this was reversed; he saw visions of a teenaged Leto but not Ghanima.

Arrakis
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:Arrakis_planet.jpg|thumb|266px|Artist's portrayal]]
'''Arrakis''', also known as "'''Dune'''", and later "'''Rakis'''" after the fall of [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], is a harsh desert planet located on the far edge of the Old [[Imperium]] in the [[Stars#Alpha Carinae|Canopus]] star system. It later became the Imperium's center under [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib's]] empire. It was the original and for a long time sole source of the [[Spice Melange]], which was vital for [[space travel]].

==Location==
Arrakis was located far from the major populated worlds and their trade routes. It was orbited by two moons: the first and larger of these bore a formation that looked like a human fist; the second had a formation that resembled a [[kangaroo mouse]].

===Fight for Survival===
The fight for survival on the harsh world had long dominated the Fremen's cultural identity. The brutal environment of Arrakis necessitated frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. Also, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of Arrakis to fend off offworld opponents who often possess far superior technology and formal training.

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal tribes, known as [[sietch]]es, which were led by a [[Naib|naib]]. Each sietch resides within one of the many rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood.

Other human settlers included the graben population in the urbanized areas. This population consisted of traders and offworlders who tried to make their living through trading water or spice. The promise of riches through the sale of water to the Fremen and the sale of the spice melange to other worlds brought many people to the more populous areas of the planet.

Arrakis also saw the peoples of [[House|Great Houses]] populate the planet. As a [[fief|siridar fief]] of the [[Imperium]], whichever [[House|Great House]] had possession of this fief would typically maintain a large population that included armies, administrative staff, family members, household staff, a spy network, and [[richece]].

After his successful invasion of Arrakis, the Baron mentions to Nefud that there are 5,000,000 people living on Arrakis. By this he means the people of the towns and villages. He is later stunned to hear from Thufir Hawat that the Fremen account for at least an additional 10,000,000. Given a total population of 15,000,000 on a planet as harsh as Arrakis.

==Environment==
[[Image:L Dune Map.jpg|thumb|North Pole of Arrakis]]
The surface of Arrakis consisted almost exclusively of dry dune deserts, hence the planet's alternative name, ''Dune''. Various weathered mountain ranges stretched across the planet, breaking up the deserts and sheltering the limited native lifeforms. Rock outcroppings also littered the planet's surface.

The atmosphere consisted of 75.4% nitrogen, 23% oxygen<ref>''[[Appendix I: The Ecology of Dune]]''</ref> and negligible amounts of trace gases; given the abundance of oxygen, the atmosphere allowed human beings to live on the planet without respiratory equipment. The production method of atmospheric oxygen sufficient to sustain limited biological life is through sandworm metabolism, which acts like an oxygen-producing factory.

Vast reserves of water were located deep within the mountains of the planet, as well as within countless [[sandtrout]]. Small amounts of water vapor existed in the atmosphere and were harvested via [[windtrap]]s.

The northern pole of the planet sat on a large plate of bedrock and was ringed by mountain ranges. Thus it was protected from [[sandworm]] incursion, until the Fremen, led by [[Paul Atreides]], used [[Atomics|atomics]] to destroy a large section of the [[Shield Wall]] shortly before he proclaimed himself emperor.

This geography, combined with the milder climate, made human habitation at the pole more comfortable and explained the presence of the capital city [[Arrakeen]].

==Biology==
Little native life survived on Arrakis, owing to its scorching heat and dry climate. The various lifeforms that did endure were eclipsed by the [[Sandworm|sandworms]], which roamed the deep deserts of the planet. The [[sandworms]] played an important role in the production of [[Spice Melange|melange]], and they aggressively protected their desert territory from humans and other sandworms alike.

The [[Fremen]], traditionalist human clans, also eked out a life on the planet, existing in the caves of rocky outcrops and mountain ranges that broke up the planetwide desert.

Other lifeforms on Arrakis included [[sandtrout]] (which interplays heavily with the [[Sandworm|sandworm]]), and the [[Muad'Dib (mouse)|kangaroo mouse]], known to the [[Fremen]] as "Muad'Dib." Some forms of flora existed on the planet, including the [[creosote bush]]. Various birds and bats existed in the ecosystems of the planet. Some of these were domesticated by the Fremen.

Specifically, the kinds of life forms that existed on Arrakis included the following:
* Poverty grass
* Ephemerals—chenopods, pigweeds, amarinth
* Scotch broom
* Low lupine
* Vine eucalyptus (from [[Caladan]])
* Dwarf tamarisk
* Shore pine
* Candelilla
* Suguaro
* Bis-naga
* Shrubs and bushes, including camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa, burrow bush, sand verbena, evening primrose, incense bush, smoke tree, and creosote bush
Various animals were part of the ecosystem, including the following:
* Burrowing animals, such as kit fox, kangaroo mouse, desert hare, and sand terrapin
* Predators, including the desert hawk, dwarf owl, eagle, and desert owl
* Arthropods, namely, [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], trapdoor spider, biting wasp, and wormfly
* The desert bat

==History==
Before the discovery of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet, Arrakis was of little tactical, biological, or geological interest to the inhabitants of the [[Old Empire|Old Empire.]] When Yansuph Ashkoko discovered it's geriatric effects however, it achieved a little more importance. After the Butlerian Jihad, the powerful effects of the [[Spice Melange|spice]], especially with regard to [[space travel]], quickly made it an essential resource and a focal point for the emerging [[Corrino Empire]]. The discovery of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] noticeably increased Arrakis's importance, until by the time of [[Paul Atreides]] it had become a critical component in the galaxy.

Previous experiments had seen sandworms die shortly after they were transplanted from Arrakis to another world, regardless of how faithful a reproduction of their ecosystem was made. As a result, while Arrakis was a fief of [[House Harkonnen]], the Corrinos sent their Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] to analyze the planet's ecosystem. Kynes' analysis of Arrakis convinced him that the planet was once a lush and fertile world. He believed that through careful and multigenerational planning, Arrakis could once again become a paradise. The Fremen, enchanted by Kynes's stories of large bodies of water, greenery, and mild temperatures not requiring [[stillsuit]]s, followed him with fervor. Kynes became so fascinated by the planet and its people that he married into a Fremen tribe, eventually being absorbed into their culture and coming to be known as a leader among the Fremen. He saw so much potential in the planet and its people that he sought to hide its secrets from the emperor. This practice led eventually to Kynes's death, but not before leaving a legacy and a vision for the Fremen people.

===[[Ascension of House Atreides]] and the [[God Emperor]]===

[[File:Dune_Messiah-Frank_Herbert_(1969)_First_edition-1.jpg|thumb]]

In 10,191 [[A.G.]], [[House Atreides]] arrived on Arrakis and took over control of the planet and spice production. By this time, the planet had for some years been under the brutal control of Atreides enemies [[House Harkonnen]], who managed spice mining operations on behalf of Padishah Emperor [[Shaddam IV]]. The Atreides rule was cut short, however, through a betrayal as part of a conspiracy between Harkonnen and Imperial forces.

House Atreides went into hiding, but after seeking refuge with the Fremen quickly became their leaders through their inherent ability to command loyalty and through their promise that Kynes's vision would be realized through their rule. Three years later, Paul Atreides, under the Fremen name of Muad'Dib, using Atreides family atomics, created a gap in the Shield Wall that had protected Arrakeen. Riding into the city on sandworms, the Fremen defeated Harkonnen and Corrino forces, and [[Paul Atreides]] declared victory and ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Arrakis became the new seat of power for both the Empire and the religious jihad that [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] unleashed upon the known universe.

Eventually, [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] limited interpretation of the [[Golden Path]] strategy led to the terraforming of the planet, carried out by Paul's son [[Leto Atreides II]], the long-lived [[God-Emperor]]. Over several thousand years, Arrakis was transformed into a green and temperate world much more habitable to humans, just as Kynes had hoped. Ultimately, however, the new ecology was dangerous to the giant sandworms, which nearly became extinct under Leto II's rule. During this time, new mountain ranges, forests, and rivers came into existence. Offworld animals were introduced and took root on the planet. Only Leto's [[Sareer]] remained evidence that Arrakis was once a desert planet.

After some 3,500 years of rule, Leto II died while crossing the [[Idaho River]] after the Guardian Wall of the Sareer opened. Leto fell into the river, and his worm-body was destroyed by the water, which was toxic to him. His body decomposed into sandtrout that absorbed water, eventually re-creating the conditions required for the sandworms to appear. Over the next 1,500 years, under the biological terraforming effect of the sandtrout/sandworm cycle, Arrakis gradually returned to being a desert. Also, over long millennia, many names for places had become shortened. Arrakis eventually became known as '''Rakis''', while the city of Arrakeen became known simply as '''Keen'''. After Leto's death, Leto's [[Fish Speakers]], the [[Rakian Priesthood]], and the [[Bene Gesserit]] took control of the planet.

===The Scattering===
Because most of humanity had gone out into [[The Scattering]], the return of the [[Honored Matres]] 1,500 years later caused the most fear about Rakis. The greater portion of humanity of the Scattering had been weaned of any need for melange, now able to safely perform foldspace journeys through the use of [[No-ships]] and [[Navigation machine]]s with no requirement for Spice-reliant Guild Navigators. The Matres in particular saw eliminating spice as a way to break the power brokers, the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood and the [[Tleilaxu]] (the only remaining users of Spice Melange), who had stayed behind in the Empire.

In an attempt to destroy the center of [[spice]] production, the Honored Matres eventually attacked the planet with their spaceborne incinerating [[Weapon, the|Weapon]], an action that destroyed all biological life and rendered parts of the planet's surface akin to fused glass. However, their efforts did not totally succeed, and the Bene Gesserit managed to escape with a ghola of Duncan Idaho; [[Sheeana]]; their leader, [[Darwi Odrade]]; and a single sandworm to [[Chapterhouse]]. The sandworm managed to survive the transplant and revived hopes in the Bene Gesserit to re-create Arrakis, or "Dune," on other planets through the [[Known Universe]].

Upon arriving at the secret Gesserit capital planet of Chapterhouse, Odrade had the worm drowned and had some of its sandtrout placed into the soil. Slowly, the world was terraformed into a planet similar to Dune, with a sandworm [[spice cycle]].

== Leitmotifs ==
Some of the [[Screen Adaptations|screen adaptations]] also use particular themes or leitmotifs to represent the planet Arrakis (Dune). The planet and its harsh environment tends to have its own distinct leitmotifs from the leitmotifs associated with the Fremen people or the sandworms.

==Trivia==
*The length of day and night on Arrakis at the poles were not explained clearly in the novels by [[Frank Herbert]].
*Little information of the pre-Imperium history of the planet was mentioned in the original novels by [[Frank Herbert]]. However, the prequel novels by his son [[Brian Herbert]] and coauthor [[Kevin J. Anderson]] stated that the existence of Arrakis was known to the [[Old Empire]].
*The name Arrakis is believed to have come from the [[wikipedia:Arabic language|Arabic]] name الراقص ''ar-rāqiṣ'', meaning "the dancer," originally a name for the star [[Wikipedia:Mu Draconis|Mu Draconis]].
*It may also be possible that the name Arrakis derives from the Arabic الرخيص ''ar-rakhīṣ'', meaning "the cheap one" or "the less worthy". Before the discovery of the spice melange, the planet was of no real value, making the name appropriate.
*Another possible source for the name Arrakis is the country of [[wikipedia:Iraq|Iraq]] (an Arabic name derived from the ancient [[wikipedia:Sumer|Sumerian]] city-state of [[wikipedia:Uruk|Uruk]]), which is known for its oil resources, and has been involved in [[wikipedia:Iraq War (disambiguation)|several major conflicts]] as a result.
*Arrakis appears to be largely based on the [[wikipedia:Arabian Peninsula|Arabian Peninsula]], including the desert environment, pseudo-[[wikipedia:Islam|Islamic]] religion, and tribal/nomadic [[wikipedia:Bedouin|Bedouin]] culture.
