'''Shaitan''' was originally the [[Fremen]] term for a powerful embodiment of evil, such as the devil or a demon. Not surprisingly the term was usually spoken in a tone of fear and disgust. To a lesser extent, it was also a name given to the [[sandworm|sandworms]] of [[Arrakis]], certainly less so than [[Shai-Hulud]].

Later the term was adopted by the [[Rakian Priesthood]] to describe  the transformation of [[Leto Atreides II]] into [[sandworms]]. In this context the term became tied to the concept of the [[Divided God]], and was used with reverence.

The Preacher
{{Original}}
[[Image:Preacher01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Preacher addresses a crowded marketplace in Arrakeen, thundering against Alia's regency]]'''The Preacher''' was the name given to a mysterious blind prophet who appeared on [[Arrakis]] during the Imperial regency of [[Alia Atreides]].

He was guided by a boy, and frequently appeared in [[Arrakeen]] to rail against both the [[Atreides Empire]] and the environmental changes occurring on the planet. His oratories evoked a variety of emotions from the people of the city, including awe, reverence, anger, and ridicule.

After meeting with [[Leto Atreides II]] in the deep desert the Preacher revealed himself to be [[Paul Atreides]], who had been captured by a [[sietch]] of rogue [[Fremen]] known as [[Jacarutu]] when he went out into the desert to die, shortly after the birth of his children and the death of his concubine, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]].

The Preacher was ultimately assassinated in the main square in Arrakeen, just prior to Leto II taking the throne, with only a handful of individuals (including Leto Atreides II and [[Gurney Halleck]]) knowing his true identity. Thus, all that the great Paul Atreides was had become legend.

His message was deep and profoundly rooted in the reality of his day: Muad'Dib was worshiped blindly by the common folk as 'the messiah' of Arrakis and the parasitic [[Qizarate]] priesthood took full advantage of this fact. What The Preacher did was to try to awaken his people to the reality of their ignorance, especially since, unknown to most, the "messiah' myth of Arrakis was planted by the Bene Gesserit's [[Missionaria Protectiva]].

''"You fool yourselves with images you cannot possibly understand. You cripple yourselves with these toads of ritual and ceremony!" ''he tells a bewildered audience. This is the essence of his message: the ignorance of the ordinary every-day citizen of Arrakis of having worshiped a man as a god (note that he calls them "idolaters") and the foolishness of submitting blindly to a group of power-hungry, traitorous fools. But it was only after the end of Leto II's reign (and the beginning of the Golden Path) that humanity realized the great extent to which it had been sabotaged for centuries by Bene Gesserit interests, Guild intrigues and disrupted in its enlightenment by petty feuds and individualism.

The Preacher was played by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Newman Alec Newman] in the ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)]]''.

{{Quote|He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, truthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides) | Muad'Dib]]'s motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of [[Battle of Arrakeen | his triumph]], he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. That is reason enough."|from "[[Arrakis]] Awakening" by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
'''Paul Atreides''' ([[10176 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), predominantely known as '''Muad'Dib''', was the first [[Kwisatz Haderach]], the last [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides]] from [[10191 AG]] until [[10196 AG]], the first and founding [[Padishah Emperor]] of the [[Atreides Empire]] from 10196 AG until [[10210 AG]], and the supreme religious leader of the [[Fremen]] as the accepted [[Mahdi]] from [[10193 AG]] onwards. The only son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides]] {{C|née [[Nerus family | Nerus]]}}, Paul's early years were overshadowed by correct suspicions of him as the Kwisatz Haderach, achieved one generation early due to the disobedience of his mother in producing a son rather than a daughter.  

When the Atreides were forced by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] into moving from their ancestral homeworld of [[Caladan]] to the desert planet of [[Arrakis]] when Paul was fifteen, he was tested with a [[Gom Jabbar|gom jabbar]] by Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], his success in this test proving him human in the eyes of the Sisterhood. On Arrakis, Paul experienced a supposed attempted assassination attempt using a hunter-seeker, although this was in reality staged by the Harkonnens, the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|historic enemies]] of the Atreides, in order to turn attention away from the traitor planted in the Atreides household, [[Suk Doctor|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]].   

Following the [[Siege of Arrakeen]] which killed his father and decimated the Atreides, Paul and his mother were taken in by the [[Fremen]] tribe of [[Sietch Tabr]] after escaping the Harkonnens and the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]], where Paul killed for the first time in a duel with the Fremen [[Jamis]]. After this fight, Paul took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] among the Fremen and found himself becoming a leader among them, and became a good friend to Tabr [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] and the lover of his niece [[Chani Kynes]].  

Fuelled by the historic prophecies of the [[Lisan al Gaib|Lisan al-Gaib]] planted by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] centuries ago, Paul found himself inching closer and closer to great power. The years he spent on Arrakis, also saw his mother Jessica drinking the [[Water of Life]], an act which allowed her to become a Reverend Mother and one which Paul later went through with himself, and the birth of his [[Pre-born|preborn]] sister, [[Alia Atreides]]. Paul also trained the Fremen in the weirding way of the Bene Gesserit to make them into the guerilla warriors known as the [[Fedaykin]], allowing them to deal serious blows against the Harkonnens and turn the tide in the ongoing [[Desert War]] against them. When the Emperor decided to come to Arrakis himself to crush Muad'Dib and get spice production back on track, Paul launched the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in his use of [[Great Convention|forbidden]] [[atomics]] in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], a battle which also saw the death of [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|his first son]].  

Finally meeting the Emperor personally, Paul revealed to Shaddam that he would destroy all of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet in a chain reaction if he did not allow him to take the Imperial throne, leading to chaos across the [[Known Universe]]. After killing his cousin [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] in a kanly duel, the Emperor and the [[Spacing Guild]] submitted to Paul's will and he was Emperor within three years. Despite his love and loyalty to his concubine Chani, Paul married [[Princess Royal|Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino]] in his quest for the Emperor's seat in the [[Landsraad]], but found navigating this relationship complex and difficult at times.  

After ruling his new [[Atreides Empire]] for twelve years, during which the galaxy was at war in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a jihad]] which the [[Fedaykin]] spread across the universe, Paul was blinded by a [[stone burner]] in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a final conspiracy]] against the Atreides throne, but managed to see through his [[Prescience|prescient]] abilities. This presceience-sight ended after the birth of his twin children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], coinciding with Chani's death, and he walked into the desert according to Fremen Law, his sister Alia becoming [[Regent]] of the empire. In the ensuing times he became known as the Preacher, an identity he held for nine years before he was murdered while preaching his 'heresy', shortly after accepting the [[Golden Path]] planned by his son Leto II, who inherited the Imperium as [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] not long after his death and the suicide of his [[Ego-memory|possessed]] sister Alia.  

==Biography==
===Family lineage===
[[File:Dune 2020 House Atreides.jpg|thumb|The Atreides were an ancient Great House dating back to the time of Agamemnon on Old Earth.]]
[[House Atreides]] was an old and wealthy [[Houses Major|House Major]] in the [[Landsraad]], tracing their lineage back thousands of years to [[King Agamemnon]], a son of [[Atreus]] in [[Greece]] on [[Earth|Old Earth]]. The Atreides had a long-standing [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] with [[House Harkonnen]] dating back ten thousand years to the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The family kept their ancestral world of [[Caladan]] a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to the Harkonnen capital of [[Giedi Prime]]. However, the Atreides were also proficient in war; they maintained [[Swordmaster|Swordmasters]], [[Warmaster|Warmasters]] and [[Mentat|Mentats]] to train and lead their army, and had even developed their own [[Battle Language]].

The [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] brought Paul's parents, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica Nerus]], who was secretly the natural daughter of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], together in [[10175 AG]], with the intention of producing an Atreides daughter who could then mate with [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]] the Sisterhood had long prepared for. However, the Bene Gesserit plans were thrown into disarray when Jessica, due to her deep love of the Duke Leto, bore a male heir, Paul, to his House rather than a girl.  

===Early life {{C|10176-10191}}===
Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-rich planet of Caladan, the ancestral Atreides home. Though he lacked companions his own age, he received tutelage from his teachers, men like [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Wellington Yueh|Doctor Yueh]], as well as deep education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday in the year [[10191 AG]], Paul's father revealed to him that his training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a [[mentat]]. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the [[Landsraad]]. Paul's latent talents also earned him the attention of the Bene Gesserit, who tested him with the [[Gom Jabbar]], as they hoped to salvage their breeding program through him.

===Desert War {{C|10191-10193}}===
====Move to Arrakis====
{{Quote|On that first day when Muad‘Dib rode through the streets of [[Arrakeen]] with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: “[[Mahdi]]!” But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the [[Lisan al Gaib | Lisan al-Gaib]], the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a [[Bene Gesserit]] and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib. |from [[Manual of Muad’Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
[[File:Ha paul hunterseeker-1.png|thumb|Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in the first months on Arrakis.]]
Paul accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] relocated to the desert world of [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. Before their departure, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor's [[Truthsayer]], tested him with the [[gom jabbar]]. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

After a supposed assassination on Paul using a hunter-seeker, Dr Yueh lowered the defensive house shields and used sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught in the [[Siege of Arrakeen]]. The Atreides army was crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape. This attack marked the beginning of the War. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] were sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needed to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan was foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hated the Baron and wished to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to kill their captors and escape into the desert. 

====With Kynes and Idaho====
Paul and Jessica initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flde to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they had died from a coriolis storm.

====Alliance with the Fremen====
[[File:Ha paul jamis fight1-1.png|thumb|Paul fights Jamis to the death.]]
In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers came into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures exploded into awareness. He saw many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he could make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive. After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] proved their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu training – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepted them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also met a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], whom he had long seen in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarmed a proud Fremen, Jamis, who took offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenged Paul to a fight to the death. Although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphed easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. Stilgar gave Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gave himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.

When they returned to the troop's sietch, they discovered the Fremen Reverend Mother was near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they made Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen were about to do, accepted to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realized she has made a mistake, that she was involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who could see genetic memories, and realized that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, would also go through the process. This had truly unfortunate consequences, because it was a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby would not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.
[[File:Paul Atreides with Maker hooks (Frank Herbert's Dune, 2000, Sci-Fi Channel).jpg|thumb|Paul preparing to first ride a sandworm]]
By [[10193 AG]], two years later, Paul had become something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani became his lover and bore him a son, whom he called Leto. He and his mother trained the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who sought out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experienced victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grew. However, in order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he had to become a [[sandrider]]. Paul attempted it and succeeded, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr sprung a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognised his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and called on him and his men to surrender. Gurney was overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrendered his men, and joined Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, were some Imperial spies who attempted to kill Paul. They were unsuccessful, and they were captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gave secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lived on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul used the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he had become a wormrider many of his followers had expected him to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul broke tradition and in doing so forced Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus took power without killing his friend. They returned to Sietch Tabr. Gurney was shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believed she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul did not know. Gurney was about to kill her when Paul walked in, managed to stop him, and explained that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney was almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgave him and he was bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

Paul's power among the Fremen grew, but he was still frustrated. He was not all he could be: he could not control his journeys into the future, and much of it was still blank to him. So he took a truly risky step and consumed a tiny amount of spice essence, and so attempted to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man hd survived this experience, and it seemed that he failed also, because he sank into a coma. Paul neglected to tell anyone what he is doing; many people thought he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believed he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, did all she can to wake him but failed, so out of desperation she called Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realised what a mad thing Paul has done, and used spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time had passed, and he gloried in his new memories and powers — he told his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself was currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He had proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declared that it was now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he came to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levied of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again. By now the Emperor was aware of who Muad'Dib was. In advance of his arrival, he sent a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they managed to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but were driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

====Battle of Arrakeen====
[[File:Concept art Battle of Arrakeen (1984 Dune film).png|thumb|The Battle of Arrakeen led to Paul's overthrow of Shaddam IV]]
After the Emperor himself had landed, Paul launched the final attack. Using the House Atreides' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blew a hole in the Shield Wall that protected the capital of Arrakeen from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoided contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". The Fremen attacked under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorted out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar were unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they were in total surprise, and the Emperor was forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loomed in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatened to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they backed off. In the surprise of Muad'Dib's attack, Alia managed to escape, and in the process killed the Baron Harkonnen.

Realizing that Muad'dib was not some mad Fremen religious leader changed the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenged Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Paul agreed even knowing that it is possible he would die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempted treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphed.

=== As Emperor {{C|10196-10210}}===
[[File:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|Paul replaced Shaddam IV as Emperor of the Known Universe]]
Paul refused to take any more nonsense. He forced the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who controlled space travel. He again threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul is capable of it – and they sent everyone home. The Emperor abdicated and retired to Salusa Secundus in 10196 AG. Paul married the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], and assumed control of the Empire. Irulan later wrote extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought. Paul then [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|sent a Fremen jihad across the known universe]].

Upon crowning himself Emperor in 10196, Paul enacted a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire. A result of this action was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. There was resistance, and Paul found himself increasingly isolated from his family and friends as he decided that the Jihad to implement his vision of mankind's future must be bloodthirsty and relentless. Whole planets were sterilized as some of the [[Great Houses]] put up a struggle against Paul's relentless Fremen armies.

====Conspiracy====
After the bloody jihad ended, Emperor Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion. The order of the Known Universe was maintained through the replacement of Corrino imperial power, which was supported by Sardaukar military strength; with Atreides imperial power, supported by Fremen military strength.

Paul's interpretation of his prescient visions also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.

Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]]. Among the schemes of his enemies were the detonation of a [[stone burner]] near where Paul and his forces stood in [[Arrakeen]], which resulted in his physical blindness. Upon Paul's recovery from this incident, he shocked all by his ability to 'see' despite not having eyes. His perfect prescient abilities allowed him to perceive the world around him.

====Death of Chani ====
Despite being able to 'see' through prescience, doubts began to surface in Paul's mind regarding his interpretation of the future. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out. That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, a plot conceived in the presence of a powerful [[Guild Navigator]]. The [[Bene Tleilax]] gave him a [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], who contained a secret trigger. Concurrently, and part of the plan, Irulan slowly poisoned Chani. 

As the Princesses' toxins slowly worked their way through Chani's body, the [[Chani Kynes|Emperor's Consort]] died during childbirth. Immediately, the [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]], who had been posing as Chani's hand-maid, sprung into action and caused the Idaho ghola to remember his Tleilaxu mission, to kill [[Muad'Dib]]. As this caused a great mental conflict within Duncan, he remembered his past with [[House Atreides]]. Immediately, Scytale realized the great scope of change that had occurred; a ghola had recovered memories of its' former life. Scytale bargained with Paul that the Tleilaxu could bring back a ghola of Chani, complete with her life experiences, for Paul to enjoy in relative obscurity—if the Atreides would abdicate. Instead, Paul killed Scytale. He then ordered Duncan to kill [[Bijaz]].

====Walk into the Desert====
After the birth of his children, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], Paul became convinced he had lost his prescient abilities; he did not foresee the birth of his son, only his daughter. Therefore, as no more than a blind Fremen, Paul disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]], as was the Fremen custom for the blind. This action made a powerful statement: it signified to the Fremen that Paul's interest was for the tribe, and that even he, Usul, Paul who was Muad'Dib, was not above Fremen law.

===As the Preacher {{C|10210-10219}}===
[[File:Preacher01.jpg|thumb|Paul as the Preacher of Arrakeen]]
Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert. By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.

==== Death ====
The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront Alia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Leto. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.

Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion. While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transformation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.

== Appearance ==
In his youth, Paul was a small boy with an oval face, with tousled coal-colored hair and green eyes. After his time among the Fremen, he grew to a a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as desiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the leathery skin. His oval face was like his mother Jessica’s, but he had stronger bones and a browline reminiscent of his maternal grandfather. He had a thin, disdainful nose, long lashes concealing lime-toned, directly staring green eyes, and a hardness in the expression like the old Duke, his paternal grandfather.

== Abilities and skills ==
* '''[[Prescience]]''': As the Kwisatz Haderach long sought out for by the breeding programme of the Bene Gesserit Order, Paul possessed a powerful ability to bridge space and time with prescient ability. From an early age, he experienced visions in his dreams which were reported to the Sisterhood by his mother Jessica and was known to have had visions that were accurate, penetrating, and defied four-dimensional explanation. This was one of the key attributes that made them first suspect him being their long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach achieved early. Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Paul's prescient ability was strengthened by the spice melange he constantly inhaled, and it grew greatest during his alliance with the Fremen people, when he first forsaw the jihad that would be waged across the Known Universe in his name, and began to try and avert it. By the end of his reign, Paul's prescience was so powerful that when he lost his eyesight due to a Tleilaxu stone burner, he could interact with the world around him without aid. This was because he was able to remember all the details of his vision of the future. Essentially, Paul knew where everyone would be and what they would say and do. While this helped him in many situations, it was also ultimately his downfall as he was helpless to prevent his future.
* '''[[Weirding Way]]''': Paul was trained by his mother in the Weirding Way of the Bene Gesserit, allowing him to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. When first encountering Sietch Tabr this saved his life, as he was able to overcome the Fremen who saught to kill him and Jessica for their water by means of the Weirding Way. He later taught the Way to many of the Fremen across Arrakis, making them into skilled and deadly Fedaykin by these means, and this was a key factor in his victory in the Battle of Arrakeen.
* '''[[Voice]]''': At the time the Atreides landed on Arrakis, Paul was also developing the audio-neuro control mechanism of Voice used by the Sisterhood to achieve complete control over a reciever. He demonstrated his emerging talent in this field when, after the decimation of the Atreides and the capture of him and his mother into an ornithopter, he used the Voice to order a Harkonnen agent to remove Jessica's gag so that she could use it even more effectively against him, and thus saving both their lives.
* '''[[Prana-bindu|Prana-bindu control]]''': Paul was taught by the supreme control of nerve and muscles known to the Bene Gesserit as prana-bindu by Jessica, which laid the foundations for his use of the Weirding Way and allowed him to gain a higher control over his body which would come to his advantage at many points in his life.
* '''Swordfighting''': In addition to the Bene Gesserit techniques taught to him by his mother for his survival, Paul became a skilled swordfighter after years of training by his chief Atreides teachers, the renowned Swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, who he nearly bested shortly before the move to Arrakis. This proved to be a vital skill, as he employed it not only to best Jamis after he declared amtal during his early years in Sietch Tabr, but later to kill his cousin, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, another skilled fighter, in a kanly duel at the time of his ascension to Emperor. 
* '''[[Mentat]] training''': For the first fifteen years of his life, much of Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a Mentat by order of his father Duke Leto. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as the Duke of the Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a Mentat-Duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. He became a fully fledged "true" Mentat after first escaping the Harkonnens with his mother, and the high level Mentat abilities he gained at that time would help him at many points in his life, including helping handle the data of the battles of his jihad and allowing him to piece together the nature of the conspiracies which were aimed against him more quickly than he could have otherwise.
* '''Endurance''': Paul's unusual endurance, especially for a male, was noted by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam when she tested him with a gom jabbar, a test which he passed through this skill. She noted that he surmounted more agony in the test than any other human of record.

== Relationships ==
=== Leto Atreides I ===
{{Quote|How do we approach the study of Muad‘Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?|from [[Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries]] by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
Paul respected his father Leto, the penultimate Atreides Duke, who had hopes for a great future for his son as a Mentat-Duke. When Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in a supposed assassination attempt, Leto grew enraged at his Mentat Thufir, who had failed to detect the trap, and was angry that the Harkonnens had tried to take the life of his son. Paul was greatly disturbed when he heard Reverend Mother Mohiam tell his mother: "for the father, nothing", and had an urge to tell Leto what she had said, although he never did. Leto felt like Paul was one of the only people to whom he could reveal his weaknesses and fears as well as entrust the fact that he had never distrusted Jessica, a fact which he told Paul to reveal to her if he never could, and which he did after Leto's death. 

=== Chani Kynes ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Paul|You're the strong one, Chani. Stay with me.|Chani|Always.|Paul and Chani's love|Dune (novel)}}
Paul first encountered Chani Kynes, daughter of the great Planetologist Liet-Kynes, during him and Jessica's initial encounter and fight with the Fremen, but by that point he had dreamed of her many times. Stilgar told her to keep Paul out of trouble and Chani helped Paul in his fight with Jamis by warning him that Jamis fought with either hand, and that he should keep his mind on the knife and not on the hand that held it. From that point they grew closer, calling each other Usul and Sihaya, and she ultimately became his concubine, and the mother of his first son, Leto Atreides II the Elder, who was killed by Sardaukar in the Battle of Arrakeen. After Paul's ascension to Emperor Chani was considered his true wife rather than his titular wife, the Princess Irulan, and became the mother of two further children with Paul, Ghanima and Leto II, before her death. The love between them was shown by her last word: ''Usul''.

=== Duncan Idaho ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}
Paul had a close bond with his Swordmaster teacher Duncan Idaho, who trained him from his earliest years, and he was greatly distraught when Idaho fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, he found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Hasimir Fenring ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Shaddam IV|Kill this upstart for me. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now ... you know the way of it. Kill him. Do it!|Hasimir Fenring|Majesty, I must refuse.|Count Fenring refuses to kill Paul|Dune (novel)}}
Paul first met Count Hasimir Fenring in 10193 AG during his final confrontation with Emperor Shaddam IV, the Count's closest friend, following the Battle of Arrakeen. Upon seeing the Count Paul felt extreme shock, as he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures, but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions. When the Emperor ordered Fenring to kill Paul, he realised that this was because the Count was a failed Kwisatz Haderach, and looking into Fenring's eyes he felt a deep compassion for the Count flow through him, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced. Seeing this, Fenring refused to kill him, accompaning the Emperor into exile on Salusa Secundus afterwards.

=== Gaius Helen Mohiam ===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Paul Atreides|Try your tricks on me, old witch. Where’s your [[gom jabbar]]? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You’ll find me there staring out at you! Have you nothing to say?|Gaius Helen Mohiam|I welcomed you to the ranks of [[human]]s. Don’t besmirch that.|Observe her, comrades! This is a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]], patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach | one person]] their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand... but... I... will... never... do... her... bidding!”|[[Jessica Atreides | Jessica]]! Silence him!|Paul defies Reverend Mother Mohiam|Dune (novel)}}
First meeting the aged Reverend Mother Mohiam when she visited Caladan to test him with a gom jabbar, Paul took instant dislike to the 'old crone', complaining about how she addressed his mother and how she treated him. When Mohiam ordered him to sit as her mother did, he told her that he was not his mother and he preferred to stand, from which she ordained that he hated her a little. Despite being judged human by Mohiam in the test, these feelings continued. He encountered Mohiam again during his final confrontation with the Emperor, terrifying her with his final ultimatum of destroying all melange after pointing out her reliance on spice as a Reverend Mother. She recognised that Paul was indeed the Kwisatz Haderach as she had long suspected. Paul declared that he was indeed the One but he would never to her bidding, and that for her role with the Emperor he could gladly have her strangled, but he thought it better punishment that she should live out her years never able to bend him to the Bene Gesserit schemes. He retained this opinion to the last, telling Alia not to execute Mohiam for her role in the conspiracy against him shortly before his walk into the desert, although she disobeyed him.

==Name==
{{Quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.|[[Stilgar]]|Dune (novel)}}

===Etymology===
Paul's surname, that of his family of [[House Atreides]], meant "son of Atreus" in Greek, due to the Atreides' descent from [[Agamemnon]], Orestes' father and the son of [[Atreus]]. 

The name '''Muad'Dib''', given by Stilgar after Paul bested Jamis in amtal, was taken from the Fremen name for the kangeroo mouse of the Arrakis desert. While he originally called himself '''Paul-Muad'Dib''' after accepting this name, as to not completely remove the name given by his father, this did not become a common name and by his time as Emperor he was generally called only Muad'Dib. While this was the open way to refer to Paul, it was also decided after Jamis' death that the private name used within the sietch would be '''Usul''', meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar" in the Fremen language. He was also called '''Abu Dhur''' or '''Abu d' Dhur'''.

===Titles===
In addition to being the '''Kwisatz Haderach''' long sought for by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, Paul was known as both the '''Lisan al-Gaib''' and the '''Mahdi''' to the Fremen. The vanquished of his jihad called him '''the Tyrant''', a title which would later be used more widely to describe his son, the God Emperor, after his assassination. In his nine years as a nameless blind Fremen after walking into the desert, Paul was known by the title of '''the Preacher''' in absence of any name that could be given to him. He was given the postthumous title of the '''Mentat Emperor''' by the Mahdi Spirit Cult. He was given the title of '''Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time''' while being called Abu Dhur by Stilgar and later his son Leto II, who also called him the '''Fil-Haquiqa''' and '''The Reality'''.

===In earlier stages===
In the original ''[[Spice Planet (story)|Spice Planet]]'' which evolved into ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Paul was called '''Barri Linkam'''.

==Behind the Scenes==
=== Paul as a hero ===
According to novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House Atreus. Noting that the characters in ''Dune'' fit mythological archetypes, Brian Herbert wrote that "Paul is the hero prince on a quest who weds the daughter of a 'king'". A primary theme of ''Dune'' and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to "give over every decision-making capacity" to a charismatic leader. He said in 1979, "The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes." He wrote in 1985, "''Dune'' was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question." In a 1970 interview, Herbert noted that the character of Paul was constructed to express "the conflict between absolutes and the necessity of the moment". Brian Herbert wrote:<blockquote>Paul Atreides (who is the messianic "Muad'Dib" to the Fremen) resembles Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), a British citizen who led Arab forces in a successful desert revolt against the Turks during World War I. Lawrence employed guerrilla tactics to destroy enemy forces and communication lines, and came close to becoming a messiah figure for the Arabs. This historical event led Frank Herbert to consider the possibility of an outsider leading native forces against the morally corrupt occupiers of a desert world, in the process becoming a godlike figure to them.</blockquote>The similarity to T.E. Lawrence was reinforced within the novel ''Dune Messiah'', in which a chapter heading-quotation is taken from a post-conquest work of Paul's, with the title ''The Seven Pillars of the Universe''. This appears to have been inspired by Lawrence's account of his war-time activities in the desert, titled ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''.

Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him, and after a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, ''Dune'' is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Paul's riding and controlling a giant sandworm cements him as a Fremen leader, and he eventually gains a level of omniscience which leads to his accession to the Imperial throne and causes the Fremen to worship him like a god.

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of ''Dune'' from earlier heroes such as Superman, A. E. van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn, and Henry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of "painful and slow personal progress". And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through "the application of mystical philosophies and techniques". For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit and Mentats).

Denis Villeneuve, director and co-writer of the 2021 film adaptation ''Dune'', compared Paul to the character Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather'', explaining that "He's training to be the Duke. But as much as he's been prepared and trained for that role, is it really what he dreams to be? That's the contradiction of that character. It's like Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather''–it's someone that has a very tragic fate and he will become something that he was not wishing to become."

The Egyptian-Canadian commentator Khalid M. Baheyeldin has enumerated the obviously Islamic concepts and references appearing in ''Dune'', to the level of finding multiple similarities between the career of Herbert's Paul Atreides and that of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Beyond the obvious general resemblance - both Muhammad and Atreides found a powerful new religion, energizing hitherto disregarded desert-dwellers to topple an old empire and build a new one - Baheyeldin noted various specific similarities between Muhammad's career and that of Atreides.

===Biographical Notes===
In the easy-to-read Basic Dune it is bizarrely extrapolated in what is probably a joke that its fake version of Paul Atreides was born on its underdeveloped Caladan, both in an excerpt from [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan's]] ''Manual of Muad'Dib'', as well as through his own thoughts. However in the great and hard [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson|Kevin J. Anderson's]] Canon Status prequel novel ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'', his birth is revealed in the only serious and Canon to take place on the world of Kaitain. At the end of the day, only Base Dune novices debate this as his birthworld in a serious manner.

In the Canon Status ''[[Paul of Dune (novel)|Paul of Dune]]'', it is revealed to be true in full Canon that Irulan, through her history books, "streamlined the story for mass consumption". This cleverly alleviates any concern ffor ridiculous Base Dune and retains the clearly lower Canon status of the Basic Dune as a lower form, as accpeted by Dune fans globally.

===In Other Media===
Alejandro Jorodowski wanted his then 12-year-old son Brontis Jodorowski to star as Paul in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''.

In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, MacLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.

In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]]. The actor, who has a Scottish accent, reportedly adapted an American accent in a relatively short span of time just to land the role. In the 2000 miniseries, Paul was initially portrayed as a sort of "spoiled brat" in order to show the audience his growth from Atreides heir to Emperor of the Known universe.

In the Denis Villeneuve's [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 ''Dune'' film]], Paul was played by Timothée Chalamet. Villeneuve stated that Chalamet was his first and only choice to play the role of Paul Atreides saying "Timothée has that kind of charismatic power. And I needed that for the audience to believe this young man will be able to raise and lead an army, and then lead a whole planet."<ref>[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/20/timothee-chalamet-dune-denis-villeneuve-rebecca-ferguson/8424993002/ Timothée Chalamet learned this new skill from 'Dune': 'I hope I won't have to use it']</ref>  Chalamet be reprising the role of Paul Atreides in the sequel to ''Dune'', titled ''Dune: Part Two'', which is scheduled to release on October 20, 2023.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dune-2-greenlit-movie-release-date-1235036655/'Dune 2' a Go From Legendary, Warner Bros.]</ref>

Sandworm
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{FeaturedArticle}}
:''This article is about the creature, Sandworm. For information on the novel ''Sandworms of Dune'', see [[Sandworms of Dune (novel)]].''
[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|A sandworm of Arrakis.]]
The '''sandworm''' was an autotrophic animal that inhabited the planet [[Arrakis]]. Where they originated is unknown, but were introduced to Arrakis before the events of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. It lived in the vast deserts and sand dunes that stretched across the surface of the planet. Most importantly, sandworms are an essential factor in the creation of the [[Spice Melange]].

Sandworms lived beneath the sand. Attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations. This was an effort to defend their territory, of which they were highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, was extremely rare, save for the mysterious [[fremen]], who had achieved some kind of mastery over the beast.

== Physical Characteristics ==
The Sandworm was the predominant lifeform on Arrakis, both honored and feared; vital and deadly. [[File:Dune-sandworm.jpg|thumb|276px|Art by Nathan Rosario]]The sandworms were extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sensed each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats.

===Size===
By anyone's standards, Sandworms could grow to an enormous size. Dr. Yueh cited that specimens "up to 450 meters long" were spotted by observers in the [[deep desert]]. To make a comparison, the largest animal of Earth was believed to be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale Blue whale] measuring in at only 33 meters, or about 7% of a large sandworm's length.

Many things commonly associated with [[Arrakis]] are surrounded in myth and mystery, and the sandworms are no exception. Some people believe that worms from 700 to even 1000 meters existed in the southern pole regions, but this could not be confirmed. See [[Paul Atreides]] during his trial of the [[sandrider]] for further reading regarding their maximum observed size.

<br />

===Age===
Due to the difficulty of studying these creatures, not much was originally known about the wild sandworms. The longevity of the sandworm was supposedly extreme, estimated in the thousands of years.

===Appearance===
[[File:Hr-giger-dune-worm-xii.jpg|thumb|Sandworm as envisioned by H.R. Giger]]
[[File:Big-sketch4.jpg|thumb|[[Dune 2000]] concept art]]
Their skin was thick, rough, and orange colored. It served the simple function of armor and was comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size. These scales overlapped and interlocked to form the armor that protected it against internal sand invasion.

As the [[Fremen]] discovered, this armor, while all but impenetrable, could be exploited. By prying open the edges of one or more of the scales, the integrity of the armor would be compromised; sand was now free to enter into the sandworms softer insides. This would cause intense irritation for the sandworm. The beast would then roll itself until the prone scale was at the highest point from the desert floor, thus minimizing the amount of sand that could enter.

A fremen poised to "ride" the beast as it rolled its open scale towards its highest point could literally mount the worm. As long as the scales remained open, the sandworm would not submerge. [[Maker hooks]] were then placed towards the front of the beast to control lateral movement. As a result, [[wormriding]] became a viable, even sacred, method of transport for the Fremen across the surface of the planet. Indeed, distances were even measured in "sandworms", the distance one could ride a worm until it was exhausted and allowed to submerge. A 20-worm ride would be a far and difficult journey.

A sandworm's internal workings resembled that of a massive blast furnace, producing intense heat and flames. This in turn provided the environmental link of supplying oxygen to the nearly plantless Arrakis. The mouth was positioned at the forward end of the creature and could easily consume gigantic objects such as [[spice harvesters]].

===Smell===
The smell of the sandworm has been particularly documented. A strong, flinty, cinnamon smell exuded from the beast, especially from the mouth. Some said it could be smelled before seen. The presence of the [[spice melange]] was intense and so was its odor.

===Lightning===
[[File:ShaiHulud.jpg|thumb|400px|Painting of Oldman]]

The approach of a sandworm towards its breach-point was often indicated by the dry lightning that frequently occurred in the area; a result of static electricity being discharged into positively-charged air.

===Diet===
The main component of the sandworm's diet was sand, and other inorganic and dry components of the Arrakis crust. It is also believed they sifted the sand-plankton for nourishment.

==Water Poisoning==
Water was fatal to a sandworm, even in small doses. Water that entered a sandworm's body would act as catalyst to accelerate its metabolism to the point that it became unstable and its vital biological functions failed. This was a violent and presumably painful death for the sandworm. It was occasionally necessary however, since the byproduct of the sandworm/water mixture was the highly toxic poison called the [[Water of Life]], which the [[reverend mothers]] used on various occasions.

== Creation of Sandworms ==
The process of sandworm creation began when [[sandtrout]] banded together after converging on a store of water deep beneath the surface of [[Arrakis]]. Indeed, water did occur naturally on Arrakis. However, due to the aforementioned process, it was always destroyed. The [[sandtrout]]/water mixture was then converted into a liquid chemical that the sandworm was capable of digesting without being poisoned. On a side note, this chemical could erupt up to the desert's surface in a violent explosion called a [[Spice blow]].

The [[sandtrout]] that survived this event would then coalesce and complete the metamorphosis into a young sandworm.

== Cultural Impact of the Sandworm ==
[[File:Dune Chronicles of the Imperium RPG front cover (art by Mark Zug).png|thumb]]
Insofar as the sandworm was essential to the creation of the [[spice melange]], on a macro scale the sandworm had an enormous impact on humanity.

To the planet's [[Fremen]] population, the creature was a spiritual symbol of their faith and saw them as physical embodiments of the One God of their original [[Zensunni]] religion. Within [[Fremen]] culture the sandworm had several additional names, notably [[The Maker]] and [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously meant ''Old Man of the Desert'', ''Old Father Eternity'', or ''Grandfather of the Desert''

Young sandworms were used by the Fremen for special ceremonies. Inducting new [[Sayyadina]]s or [[Reverend Mother|reverend mothers]] was a prime example of the sandworms essential cultural role.

===Decline of the Sandworm ===
After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the [[Zensunni]] religion across the [[known universe]], the reverence paid to the sandworm spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II]], due to the fact that he had become something of a hybrid, both man and worm.

The terraforming of [[Arrakis]] posed a grave risk to the sandworm, which found life outside the arid desert fatal. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the sandworm once again thrive on Arrakis for approximately another 1500 years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during [[the Scattering]]. This exercise yielded questionable success.

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on [[Arrakis]], including, it was believed, the remaining sandworms. However, this was not before [[Miles Teg]] and [[Darwi Odrade]] had managed to capture a sandworm. Held in an artificial environment on [[Chapterhouse]], the secret and temporary base of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood, this worm would have been the key to re-seeding its population.

===On Chapterhouse===
The first place that Odrade's sandworms began a new [[spice cycle]] was on the [[Bene Gesserit]] homeworld of [[Chapterhouse]]. After their introduction, the [[sand trout]] began to turn the once-lush world into a desert.

== Conception ==
Author Frank Herbert conceived the sandworms based on dragon mythology, particularly fictitious dragons that guard some sort of treasure, such as the creature in ''Beowulf'' and the Dragon of Colchis from the greek myth of Jason. The sandworms of Arrakis will attack humans who attempt to harvest the Spice, as if guarding it (even though the Spice is of no interest for these creatures, since it is waste matter). The sandworms are referred to as "the dragons on the floor of the desert" in ''Children of Dune''. 

Illustrator John Schoenherr gave the sandworm three triangular lobes that form the lips of its mouth. They are also depicted as colossal lampreys or leeches (lacking the three mouth as descripted), as well as terrestrial annelids. 

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
In the 1984 film, the sandworms were portrayed as having the three triagular lobes from their lips. In addition, they were also capable of devouring humans, as can be inferred by Vladimir Harkonnen's ultimate fate in said film courtesy of Alia. For the 2021 adaptation, director Denis Villeneuve spent a year designing the look of the sandworms to make them look "possible" and "prehistoric enough", working "from the texture of the skin, to the way the mouth opens, to the system to eat its food in the sand". Their teeth are more spike in shape, in comparison to previous live-action iterations.

}}{{Quote|What can I say about Jessica? Given the oppurtunity, she would attempt [[Voice]] on [[God]].|[[Reverend Mother/XD | Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD | Gaius Helen Mohiam]]|Dune: House Corrino}}
'''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG/XD|10154 AG]] - [[10256 AG]]), born as '''Jessica Nerus,''' was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son Emperor [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], and of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

== History ==
===Upbringing===
A result of the [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] and [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]], who was called by her birth name Tanidia Nerus in breeding charts.

Due to this, prior to marrying Leto she was referred to as Jessica Nerus in Bene Gesserit records, as opposed to Jessica Mohiam or Jessica Harkonnen, which was top secret information and she was not named this.

She was raised from birth by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides]] heir Leto Atreides I, to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced Bene Gesserit education and training.
====Relationship with Leto Atreides I====
[[Image:Jessica.jpg|thumb|left|The Lady Jessica, bound concubine of the Duke Leto Atreides, played by [[Francesca Annis]]]] The Bene Gesserit plan to couple Jessica with Duke Leto Atreides I initially appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the official concubine of Leto Atreides I, which allowed him to also marry. Such political union prove advantageous for the Great [[House]].

However, Jessica felt a great pity from the grief that Leto felt over the death of his first son, [[Victor Atreides]].

The relationship between the two quickly evolved into genuine love, and due this love, Jessica disobeyed her orders and give birth to a son, Paul Atreides, who would be heir of House Atreides, and ultimately ruined the Bene Gesserit plans.

====Ilesa Ecaz====
In [[10,187 AG]], when Leto announced that he was going to marry [[Ilesa Ecaz]] to strengthen House Atreides, Jessica took this in dutiful stride. Out of her love for Leto, she genuinely tried to welcome Ilesa to [[Cala City]], and showed her the daily tasks of managing [[Castle Caladan]]. Ilesa was suddenly killed during the wedding ceremony, situation that started the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]. Once the war ended, Leto promised he would never marry, and that Jessica would be his one and only mate.

====Tessia Struck====
In [[10,188 AG]], Jessica and Paul visited [[Ix/XD|Ix]] so that Paul could spend time as an exchange student in [[Vernii]] City, just as his father had done decades earlier. To Jessica's dismay, while there, the Bene Gesserit [[guilt-caster]] [[Stokia]] and three other Sisters visited [[Tessia]] Vernius. They demanded that Tessia produce more children for the Gesserit breeding program, which Tessia refused.

Unbeknownst to Jessica, Stokia used her [[psychic]] powers to put Tessia into a comatose trance, which rendered Tessia helpless.

====Bronso and Paul Run Away====
Later that day, Rhombur decided to tell his son, [[Bronso Vernius]], about his true parentage, that he was the artificially conceived son of [[Tyros Reffa]]. Bronso, who was 11 years old, reacted bad and encouraged Paul to run away with him off-world. Jessica was concerned about her missing son, and [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] were dispatched from [[Caladan]] to aide in finding them. A few days later, they received information that both arrived first to [[Chusuk/XD|Chusuk]], and now could be found on [[Balut]] with a [[Jongleur]] performing group.
When Jessica and the rest of the searchers from House Atreides and [[House Vernius]] arrived on Balut, they found both Bronso and Paul well treated by the performing group. The Jongleur group was to give a performance in honor of the Governor of Balut's upcoming marriage in the planet's famed [[Theater of Shards]]. Paul was able to figure that an assassination attempt was planned.

Paul saved the life of the planetary Governor [[Alra Kio]], but when Rhombur pushed Balut's leader out of the way, the intense sound blast hit him, and ravaged his body. Jessica and the others recoiled in horror as Rhombus died, and Bronso cradled his dying father.

Just before Rhombur died, he whispered his last words to his son, "Is Paul safe?" Deeply hurt that his father did not speak of him or his mother while dying, Bronso cast Jessica and the rest of House Atreides out of his life for the next 12 years. The Atreides returned to Caladan.
=== Migration to Arrakis ===
[[Image:Dune210106-12.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|The Lady Jessica takes the Water of Life]] In [[10,191]] AG, when [[House Atreides]] was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]] and their son Paul. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

When [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] seized control of [[Arrakis]], Leto was killed, and Jessica and [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]]. Her grief over losing [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]], who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with his daughter [[Alia Atreides]].

====Life as a Widow====
=====Reverend Mother=====
The Fremen of [[Arrakis]] were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own [[Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her. Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged [[Reverend Mother]], Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to [[Reverend Mother]] status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination]] in her daughter Alia.

=====Duchess of Caladan=====
After her son conquered both [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]] and House Harkonnen to become Emperor, Jessica remained on [[Arrakis]] for a year. She accompanied Emperor [[Muad'Dib]] on his first official state visit back to [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. Paul and Jessica met with the minor [[Ecaz]] official that Paul had put in place as governor of Caladan, the Prince [[Xidd Orlaq]].

While there, Paul attempted to return to the joy of his childhood, but was unable to, as he realized that he was no longer just a Duke, but an Emperor. When a courier came to [[Cala City]], announcing that Fremen warriors had taken [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], Paul made his mother, [[Duchess]] and ruler of the water planet; a post that Jessica was happy to assume. A year later when Jessica visited Paul on Arrakis, she arrived with Gurney Halleck.

In Caladan, Jessica and Gurney settled into the rule of the planet with continued justice and fairness. She exspecailly loved to join in the local festivities in [[Cala City]] during the changing of the seasons. One such festival was the one of the "[[Empty Man]]".

=====Visit to Salusa Secundus=====
Paul asked his mother to accompany [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]] and [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]] on a fact-finding mission to the exiled [[Corrino]] homeworld of [[Salusa Secundus]] provide an update on the status of the terra-forming of the planet. On Salusa Secundus, the former [[Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] and his aide [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] greeted Jessica's entourage and invited them to a formal dinner. While there, the conversation was steered by Fenring towards Paul's sterilization of worlds. Only Chani could speak positively of Emperor Paul's actions.

Later that week, the fact-finding tour was guided to the other side of Salusa to witness terra-forming first hand. [[Lars Siewesca]], his assistant [[Qhomba]] and the rest of the world-altering [[planetologist]]s blew up an underground aquifer. Lars reported to those assembled that the water from the aquifer would irrigate nearby canyons and that Salusa would be a garden in a couple of centuries. Jessica observed that Shaddam had said out loud that he could not wait that long, reminding Jessica of Corrino treachery of the past.

=====The Sisterhood's Offer=====
As the years went by, and [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's Jihad]] reached fever pitch, Jessica began to wonder of her son's sanity, believing that perhaps he had turned to [[Abomination]]. During a visit to the Motherhood on Wallach IX, Jessica was approached by Mohiam and Mother Superior [[Harishka]], who offered Jessica the post of [[Mother Superior]] of the entire Bene Gesserit order, if she kill Paul.

As Jessica thought of all of the human suffering that Paul had created throughout the universe, and though torn by the thought of killing her own son, Jessica inwardly agreed that Paul had indeed become the most brutal ruler in the history of mankind.

=====Rise of Bronso=====
In a secret meeting, Paul arranged to meet his mother and the now restored relationship with [[Bronso Vernius]] of the planet [[Ix]]. Suddenly Paul stepped out of the shadows, to explain to his mother the role of the Jihad.

Paul explained to Jessica that he ''had'' to sterilize those worlds, because the people that had looked upon him as some type of Messiah, have to learn the kind of tyranny that false messianic hopes could foster. After seeing his atrocities, mankind never would trust in one human for a type of salvation again. He calmly explained that he planned to sterilize even more worlds, but was secretly evacuating the populace of each world to limit the number of deaths. He also told her about Bronso's secret mission—to write diatribes and publications about Paul's failings.

=====Murder for Peace=====
Jessica immediately returned to Caladan to find the planet in an uproar. The people of the water world had declared independence from the [[Emperor]], and were holding rallies of secession. Gurney, in Jessica's absence had tried to negotiate and reason with the planetary rebels, to no avail. When Jessica arrived at [[Castle Caladan]] in [[Cala City]], she summoned ten of the secessionist leaders to brokering negotiations. Jessica served them all a bountiful dinner with toasts of drinking water.

Unbeknownst to the rebels, Jessica secretly poisoned the water, and turned the toxic substance into an inert mixture in her own body, by using Gesserit techniques. As the mayor of Cala City, and others that Jessica had known for years fell and dropped dead, realized that she "did what she had to do" to save Caladan from the misguided rebel leaders, and from Paul's wrath had he found out about the rebellion.

====After the Death of Paul====
Immediately after the supposed death of Paul, Jessica returned with Gurney to Arrakis, out of concern for her grandchildren, Leto and Ghanima. By this time, she had somehow learned of her maternal parentage. She was also dismayed about the rising cruelty that her daughter Alia used in consolidating her power after Paul's "death". She watched with alarm as Alia created the [[Mahdinate]], a super-religious organization based on the Atreides family. Jessica was also concerned about how Alia banned all forms of opposing expression, and had executed Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso]] Vernius of Ix, for his writings the changes that Paul had gone through. She eventually returned to Caladan in deep concern for the Empire.[[Image:Jessica2.jpg|thumb|Lady Jessica by M.Stribling]]
===Later Years===
Jessica returned to [[Arrakis]], long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

For her protection against her murdering daughter, [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] (the ghola formerly known as Hayt) "kidnapped" Jessica and took her to Salusa Secundus, home of the exiled Corrino House. There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

===Legacy===
In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]]) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

Otheym
{{Original}}

'''Otheym''' was a renowned [[Fremen]] fighter and devoted follower of [[Paul Atreides]]. He was a key figure in the training of Fremen fighters in the [[Weirding Way]], and in the liberation of [[Arrakis]] from [[House Harkonnen]].

Originally from [[Sietch Gara Kulon]], Otheym came to [[Sietch Tabr]] to join Muad'dib's crusade and was one of the first [[Fedaykin]]. Otheym was also the one tasked with taking the Waters of Life to a very large pre-spice mass, which if intiated, would have created a deadly chain reaction ultimately destroying all vectors of the sandworm.

Otheym later served as a senior commander in the spread of [[Muad'dib's Jihad]] across the [[Known Universe]]. He returned to Dune after contracting the [[spitting disease]] on [[Tarahell]]. A true Fremen and friend to Muad'dib until the end, Otheym provided details on those plotting against the Atreides Emperor. He had one daughter named [[Lichna]] with his wife [[Dhuri]].

'''Alia Atreides''' (November<ref>Book II of ''Dune'' ends in mid-autumn, which is late October or early November. Alia has still not been born. Early in Book III, Alia is stated to be about two years old. We also know that it is still 10,193 at the end of Book III, due to Appendix IV. It seems very unlikely that Book III covers just a month, so we can make a fair assumption that Alia was born in November 10,191.</ref> [[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), also known as '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' and later '''Coan-Tean''' ("the female death-spirit who walks without feet") to the [[Fremen]] and called '''Hawt the Fish Monster''' on the outer worlds, was the posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], born on the planet [[Arrakis]]. She was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides]]. As [[regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based on the cult of her personality. She later leapt to her death in defiance of the possession by the spirit of a younger [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] retained in her [[Other Memory]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Alia was still in the womb when Jessica took the [[Water of Life]]. Thus she was [[pre-born]], and highly susceptible to [[Abomination]] from before birth. After living with the [[Fremen]] for several years, she was present in the palace on [[Arrakeen]] when her brother and his forces successfully conquered the combined forces of the [[Emperor|Emperor's]] [[Sardaukar]] and [[House Harkonnen]].

During the invasion she poisoned Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] with a [[Gom Jabbar]], although not before revealing to the latter her familial ties to Harkonnen, and slew dying soldiers on the battle field for their water, earning her the name St. Alia of the Knife.

===Regency===
====Establishing Her Rule====
Later, upon the death of Paul, and with his children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule, Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]]. She was corrupted by power and established a cult of personality, using rich trappings and grandiose titles such as the [[Mahdinate]] to build considerable political weight.

====Into Abomination====
Shortly thereafter, Alia fell fully into Abomination, and was secretly tormented by the living personalities of countless ancestors. Chief among these was the personality of Vladimir Harkonnen, who sought to use his granddaughter as a tool to reclaim power from beyond the grave.

====Relationships====
Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with [[Fremen]] was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.

Though she loved and admired Paul, her brother, she also partly resented his influence. And her love for the original [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] was ultimately destroyed by a casual affair with [[Javid]], one of her priests who secretly served the [[Fremen]] insurgents who plotted against her.

====Spiralling Downward====
During the same years in which she held herself aloof from family and friends, Alia indulged in massive doses of [[spice melange|melange]], ostensibly for the purpose of broadening her [[prescience|prescient]] vision. However, Alia lacked her brother's prescient ability, and the [[spice trance]] most often failed her. The same drug which had initially keyed her sensitivity to her ancestral voices could be depended upon to keep those same voices from becoming blurred or unavailable. As a result, Alia's heavy melange consumption became a means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors and gave them power.

Alia's actions during her Regency were those of a power-hungry woman aided by the memories of generations of ambitious rulers and princelings. Her people began to mistrust and fear her, calling her, by the time of ''Children of Dune'', Coan-Teen, the "female death-spirit who walks without feet." Her every maneuver including her marriage to the first Duncan Idaho ghola, was seen as having been performed in order to solidify her own position, and her manipulation of the children in whose names she ruled was also considered a devious maneuver. Not content with having destroyed herself, she set about to lead her niece and nephew into similarly destructive ways. Since the most direct way of achieving this goal involved the children's becoming enmeshed in their ancestral memories, Alia continually tried to interest them in the spice trance.

====Death====
After increasing pressure and control from the internal genetic council of Vladimir Harkonnen, Alia orders the assassination of [[The Preacher]], despite knowing it was her beloved brother. Upon Leto's return from the desert and a subsequent battle, he gives her a choice, the Trial of Possession or suicide. In a final act of defiance against the surmounting internal control from the Baron, Alia throws herself from a high window to her death, a death that was witnessed by her mother Jessica, the Atreides twins, and Farad'n Corrino.

Had it not been for her death, Alia could have continued to rule for several centuries by regenerating her cellular structure. According to Fremen tradition, as with all Abominations the only cure was death.

===Legacy===
The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. In the months prior to Leto II's death, a [[Cult of Alia]] was discovered on [[Giedi Prime]] by Duncan Idaho's agents. Ultimately, Alia's influence vanished after Leto's death, some three and a half thousand years after her own death.

==Behind the Scenes==
*In the ''[[Children of Dune]]'' TV mini-series, Alia kills herself with a [[crysknife]], instead of committing suicide by autodefenestration.
*[[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] portrayed Alia in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie]]. While still directly responsible for Harkonnen's demise, her method of killing him is slightly different, as she instead telekinetically shoves him out of a window and has a sandworm devour him.
*Laura Burton portrayed the child Alia in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|Dune 2000 miniseries]], while [[wikipedia:Daniela Amavia|Daniela Amavia]] took over the role of the teenaged and adult Alia in the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]].
**Amavia is actually nine years older than [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]] who played Alia's much older brother Paul.

==Trivia==
The name Alia (also spelt Alya or Aaliyah) means "[http://www.behindthename.com/name/alya sky, heaven, loftiness]" in [[wikipedia:Arabic language|Arabic]] and "other, another, else" in Latin. In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 film]], [[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] portrays the character wearing a [[wikipedia:Hijab|Hijab]], a headscarf commonly worn by [[wikipedia:Arab people|Arab]] and [[wikipedia:Muslim|Muslim]] women.

Though it was not shown in the films, in the books Alia was stated to have begun to gain weight toward the end, A "plumpness which had begun to bulge her body", showing she might have been overindulging due to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's influence.

Zensunni/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Zensunni}}

[[File:C306782831b898192fcecff680c9e755.jpg|thumb|Rogue Zensunni -Fanart]]


'''Zensunni''' was a religious belief system prominent with many cultures spread across the [[Known Universe]], especially those descended from disadvantaged and enslaved peoples.

== History ==
Little is known of the evolution of the Zensunni faith. What is beyond doubt is that the Zensunni belief was an amalgamation of two ancient religions: ''Sunni Islam'' and ''Zen Buddhism''.

They were followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of Maometh (the so-called "[[Third Muhammed]]") about [[1381 BG]]. The Zensunni religion 
is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to "the ways 
of the fathers." Most scholars name [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] as leader of the original 
schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male 
spokesman for his second wife, [[Nisai]].<ref>'''''[[Dune]]''''', '''Termiology of the Imperium, page 345'''</ref>

==Origins==
By the end of the [[Old Empire]] and the start of the [[Time of Titans]] Zensunnis thought the war was the prophesied [[Kralizec]], the End of the Universe, and they refused to battle. Instead they retreated to [[Unallied Planets|distant isolated planets]]. Yet that struggle had not ended according to the prophecy: the human race had survived the [[Thinking Machines]].

They had become a prominent belief system among many [[human]] cultures among the stars. However, the refusal of the Zensunni spiritual leaders to engage in active resistance against the enemies of free humanity resulted in a broad and angry backlash. Thus, for thousands of years practitioners of Zensunni, and its sibling faith [[Zenshiite]], were persecuted and enslaved by humans, as well as by [[Titans]] and [[Thinking Machines]].

As a result of being enslaved, [[Bel Moulay]] inspired the first revolt in [[Starda]], which was in turn crushed by Lord [[Niko Bludd]] and the [[Dragoon]] guards. [[Aliid]], a young slave who was torn from his parents, vowed for revenge. He was able to receive it decades after the first revolt. Aliid had planned a revolt while the nobles of the planet were celebrating. He managed to acquire an ancient [[lasgun]]. [[Tio Holtzman]] planned to protect himself from the revolt using one of his inventions, the [[Holtzman shield]]. Aliid intended to personally assassinate Holtzman. When the Savant saw the laser, he knew exactly what would happen, but Aliid did not. The whole city of Starda was vaporized by the sub-atomic explosion that is caused by a lasgun firing upon a shield.

Later, the Zensunni predisposition was manipulated by the [[Bene Gesserit]], via their [[Missionaria Protectiva]] arm and [[Panoplia Propheticus]] strategy, for their own political objectives. One of the most prominent homes of Zensunni beliefs, [[Arrakis]], was of particular interest in this regard. The exclusivity of the critical [[Spice Melange]] on the planet made the resident [[Fremen]], staunch followers of Zensunni, of natural interest to the Bene Gesserit.

The emergence of the powerful [[Paul Atreides]], and his adoption of Fremen ways, gave Zensunni beliefs a dramatic new popularity. After his ascension to [[Emperor]] Paul embarked on a ferocious jihad that brought great violence and turmoil. The stark contrast of these actions vis-à-vis pacifist Zensunni beliefs was not lost on some of the faithful.

== Core Beliefs ==
As a faith, Zensunni has the following core tenets:
* Belief in one, all-powerful [[Buddallah]], whose word is rendered by prophets;
* Aversion to violence, unless it is for self-protection and no other options remain;
* Belief in mystical interpretations of God's will.

== Behind the Scenes ==
The persecution or enslavement of the [[Wandering Zensunni]] by the [[League of Nobles]] and the [[Thinking Machines]] was specifically created in the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. References to harassment and persecution are found in [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] Dune novels.

Sheeana Brugh/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Sheeana Brugh}}
[[Image:sheeana.jpg|thumb|Sheeana & the Sandworms]]
'''Sheeana Brugh''' was a [[Fremen]] who lived approximately 1500 Standard Years after the death of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]], the [[God-Emperor]]. She came to the attention of the [[Rakian Priesthood]], the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Tlulaxa|Bene Tleilax]] because it was discovered that the [[sandworm/XD|worms]] of Rakis obeyed her.

== Early life ==
Sheeana was raised by her parents in a shanty town on the outskirts of [[Arrakeen|Keen]] on [[Arrakis|Rakis]]. When she was eight years of age her town was destroyed by a worm. Sheeana watched from a distance as her parents and fellow villagers were killed. When Sheeana approached the worm that orphaned her, she was not killed by the creature. Instead, she discovered that the worm obeyed her.

Shortly thereafter, Sheanna found herself at the city of Keen. She was led there by a worm after she climbed atop of it. Upon her arrival at Keen the Rakian Priesthood adopted the girl and obeyed her every whim.

== Involvement with the Bene Gesserit ==
[[Image:Sheeana Fremen.jpg|thumb|left|Sheeana, from the Russian cover of ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'']]
Some years later, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood took an interest in her, in order to fulfill a plan orchestrated by the Sisterhood to propagate the worms on their [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]] planet. The Bene Gesserit eventually made Sheeana a sister, although her Fremen upbringing and an early exposure to [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] sexual practices (courtesy of the [[Tlulaxa|Tleilaxu]]) made her an unpredictable element within the Sisterhood.

Bene Gesserit analysis of her DNA revealed that Sheeana was a descendant of [[Siona Atreides]] and [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]. This, according to the Sisterhood's theories, was the reason why the worms obeyed her. It was also how the Sisterhood used her to lure a worm into a [[no-ship]], just before the sterilization of the surface of Rakis by the Honored Matres. From there it made its way to Chapterhouse where it was to be re-seeded.

== Escape ==
Having grown unhappy with her involvement with the Bene Gesserit, and after striking up a friendship with the Sisterhood's [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]], Sheeana escaped in a [[no-ship]] with Duncan, the imprisoned Tleilaxu Master [[Scytale]], Ghola Teg, The Rabbi's Party (including Rebecca), some proctor Bene Gesserits and some [[sandworm/XD|sandworms]]. Their escape occurred during the turmoil of the Bene Gesserit-Honored Matres merger, and saw them journey beyond the [[known universe]] into uncharted territory, as the Bene gesserit splinter group searched for a new home.

== On Board the ''Ithaca'' - The First Decade ==
In the first few years after Duncan Idaho folded space to escape from the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]], [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], it was soon realized that the [[no-ship]] would most likely be on a multi-year journey. Sheeana took it upon herself to restart the [[ghola]] project with the help of the [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]]. In exchange for allowing Scytale to create a ghola of himself, he allowed Sheeana full access to his [[nullentropy]] tube containg the cells of human-kinds most revered leaders.

Sheeana realized that should the ship be captured by the unknown Enemy, whose passengers did not know they were being chased by [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking machines]], the gholas could aide with strategies in the fight. The first few gholas that Sheeana created were of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]], [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], and [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]]. Sheeana also decided a year later to create [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]], [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Wellington Yueh]], and they were decanted, and began their growth.

Amongst the ultra-conservative [[proctor]]s that she had taken from Chapterhouse, led by [[Garimi]] and [[Stokes]]; they fought bitterly with Sheeana in creating a ghola of the first known [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], Paul.

== Second Decade on the ''Ithaca'' ==
=== As a Leader ===
When Sheeana decided and then created a ghola of Leto Atreides II, both Garimi and Stokes first tried to kill him when he was just an infant. Leto's inherent sandworm DNA momentarily re-adjusted Leto's body composition and he struck violently at both [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[proctor]]s, and gravely injured Stokes. Both were caught by Sheeana, and as punishment she put the care and welfare of Leto into Garimi's hands.

During this time on the no-ship, Sheeana made a friend of the [[Futar]]s who had been on the ship when it escaped from The [[Keep]] years earlier. The leaders of the Futars on the ship, [[Hrrm/XD|Hrrm]], befriended Sheeana, but continually demanded for the feline group to be guided by their unknown [[Handlers/XD|Handlers]]. 

When Sheeana would visit the huge kilometer-long central core of the ship, the Bene Gesserit practitioner would often commune with the sandworms being held in the vast storage area there. The giant beasts had grown to sixty feet long, and were guided by a huge leader, whom Sheeana named [[Monarch]]. Sheeana knew that eventually the sandworms in the hold would need to be released onto a planet, where they could grow and reporduce, as needed.

=== Rikka's Planet ===
As Idaho lurched the no-ship throughout the heavens, he used his latent prescient ability to pick the location that the ''Ithaca'' come into the [[Known Universe]] out of. After wandering for many years, Duncan brought the vessel above a planet completely hidden by a planet-wide [[no-field]]. Sheeana led the landing party which investigated the former Honored Matres] stronghold. The planet was completely deserted, but it's building and other infrastructure was basically intact. 

After the Sheeana activated a holo-recording in a judicial building with [[Garimi]], they learned that a Matre sub-commander named [[Rikka]] had been infected by a virulent plague, and had brought it back to her home world, and had been put on trial. Rikka desctribed in the centuries old recording how the Enemy with "many faces", in actuality the [[Thinking Machines]], had sprung the Plague, and that it would soon infect everyone on the world. The judicial body on the ancient recording still sentenced Rikka to the [[Long Death]]. The civilization had then subsequently perished. As the location was well know to the ancient enemy, Sheeana and the Gesserit sisters decided not to settle down on the world.

=== Planet of the Handlers ===

====The Futar Hunt====
As Miles Teg's latent abilities began to surface more and more, he set the ''Ithaca'' down out of fold-space at the [[Planet of the Handlers]]. The world was inhabited by [[futar]]s and unbeknownst to the ''Ithaca'' crew, [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s—who were loyal to the reborn Thinking Machine empire. As futars were detected by the no-ship from space above the world, this development caused joy for Hrrm and his half-human/half-feline compatriots, as they believed they had finally found their home.

The ''Ithaca'' crew went down to the jungle world in one group, but were soon separated into two separate parties guided by the futar's Handlers. This caused Sheeana, [[Miles Teg]], in one group; and the Jewish [[Rabbi/XD|Rabbi]], and the ghola of Thurfit Hawat, in the second group; to be especially on guard. The leader of the Handlers told Sheeana and the group that a special ceremony was to be provided especially for them—the hunting and killing of five [[Honored Matre]]s by a clan of futars, and that Hrrm and his sub-clan would be allowed to participate.

====Escape from the Handlers====
Immediately the five captured Honored Matre was led into the hunting grounds, where they put up a long and bitter battle against Hrrm and the other ''homo sapien felinius'' creatures, but it was to no avail. As the devouring of their carcass progressed, it became evident to Sheeana and Miles that the Handlers were indeed Face Dancers, and that the landing party were to be the next victims. Sheeana immediately yelled out to Hawat and the Rabbi, who were in another observation pod, to get back to the ''Ithaca'' by any means necessary. Miles re-awakened his faster-than-sight fighting abilities, and killed many of the Face Dancers as they stood in the way of his and Sheeana's escape back to the landing craft.

As their landing craft safely boarded the ''Ithaca'', Sheeana and Teg disembarked. Sheeana raced to the bridge of the vessel, and had to bring Idaho out of trance that he had hypnotized himself into, as he thought of the sexual bonding he had gone through years earlier with [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]]. Sheeana then yelled at Idaho to keep a sharp look out for the returning landing craft of Hawat. As Hawat's craft reached the ''Ithaca'', it was rammed stridently by those the Face Dancers/Handlers, but managed to navigate into the landing bay, and though it caught on fire, both Hawat and the Rabbi were able to disembark. Two other Handler craft tried to ram the ''Ithaca'' to damage it, but Idaho was able to fold space to safety, just as [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]] again tried to capture the vessel in their [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]]. As the ''Ithaca'' sped away to safety, the net was severely damaged.

===Freeing Duncan Idaho===
Immediately afterwards, Sheeana took it upon herself to free Idaho from the sexual enslavement that he still felt towards Murbella. Using all of her Bene Gesserit techniques, Sheeana used her stamina over the course of an evening to break the hold that [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]] had on Idaho. Later in a ceremony to end his dependence once and for all, Duncan eliminated all traces of Murbella from his life, even down to her stray hairs that had been in his private quarters.

===More Gholas, and Sabotage'===
Nineteen years after the ''Ithaca'' left Chapterhouse, Sheeana decided to restart the ghola project. She realized that the ''Ithaca'' was under-populated, and could accommodate a human population hundreds of times greater than it currently carried. She also craved the special abilities of the gholas she created, in the upcoming battle with the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]] that she knew would eventually occur. Sheeana decided to create [[Alia Atriedes/XD|Alia Atreides]], and she was decanted, and began her growth.

After twenty-one years had passed, Sheeana had finally convinced Garimi of the import of the ghola program, even that of Scytale's replicant, his own ghola. To accelerate the program, and acting upon a haunch of her own prescient powers and whom the Enemey was, Sheeana decided to create gholas of [[Xavier Harkonnen]], [[Serena Butler]], and the great general [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]]. The program was slowed and thwarted, as a saboteur aboard the no-ship killed the gholas just before they could be decanted; and the [[axlotl tanks]] that carried them. The ship's leader of security, Thufir Hawat quizzed much of the ship's staff, but he found that the tank's security equipment had been tampered with, and rendered useless.

== Last Years ==
===Qelso===
Both Sheeana and Idaho were surprised, as were all aboard, as the ''Ithaca''[ came out of fold-space above the fruitful, but dying planet of [[Qelso]], and both Sheeana and Duncan wondered at Idaho's developing prescient ability. Qelso had been a seed world that [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]] had sent sisters to, and had been seeded with sand-trout to begin a spice cycle. The inhabitants were openly hostile to the Bene Gesserit for this reason, and killed [[Stokes]] when they found out she was of the Sisterhood. The natives held hostage some of the crew that went down to the planet.  Duncan, who stayed invisible to the Enemy as long as he was on the ship, decided to rescue the group.

It was unneeded as the natives released Sheeana, Teg, and the others; but the gholas of Stilgar and Kynes stayed behind to help the bitter natives adapt to the encroaching desert and the ever increasing number of sandworms on the world. Since Idaho had made himself vulnerable to the watchful eyes of [[Daniel/XD|Daniel]] and [[Marty/XD|Marty]], and the ''Ithaca'' had to fold space again to safety. 

===Final Sabotage', and Capture===
Later, against Sheeana's advice, when the ghola of Leto II went to commune with the sandworms that were in the hold of the ship, the ghola Hawat went to guard him should the giant beasts turn on the young man. The worms, led by [[Monarch]], reared up when Hawat entered the hold, and immediately killed Hawat, and showed him to be an Enhanced Face Dancer. This led to a ship wide search for other saboteurs that might be involved in subversion. To question everyone aboard at the same time, all of the inhabitants of the Ithaca were called to the main assembly hall, and were questioned intently by Sheeana and her fellow truthsayers.

But it was the ghola of Scytale who used the old Tleilaxu [[Whistling language]], which caused all Face Dancers muscles and visages to momentarily become jumbled. It was revealed that the Rabbi was indeed an Enhanced Face Dancer, and the Dancer stole away to the vessel's bridge, killed [[Garimi]], and locked himself in. The Dancer immediately began to destroy the ship's navigation, cloaking, and engine systems; and the ship returned to visibility. Idaho remembered back, and realized the Dancers must have boarded years earlier, at the planet of the Handlers, and killed the ''real'' Rabbi and Hawat.

Immediately the [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]] reappeared, and Thinking Machine starships began to surround the no-ship. The ghola of Alia managed to sneak into the cockpit of the ''Ithaca'', killing the Dancer, and opened the area. Idaho and Teg raced into the control room, Teg then went into hyper-movement, and raced around the ship at sonic speed, and repaired all of the ship's systems. As Duncan engaged the [[Holtzman Engine/XD|Holtzman Engine]]s, a Machine starship rammed the ''Ithaca'', and forced it into submission. Idaho and Sheeana signaled surrender, and the ship was brought to the Machine Capital of [[Synchrony]], as the inhabitants of the no-ship realized that their Enemy were Thinking Machines. 

==On the Day of Kralizec==
===Battle in Synchrony===
Most of the passengers associated directly with the ghola of Paul Atreides were led to the [[Cathedral]] in the heart of Synchrony by the ghola of [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], the Machine Ruler [[Erasmus]], and Face Dancer and Machine guards; Sheeana and Leto, and many of the ship's inhabitants were left behind and stayed on the ship, with ideas of their own. Duncan and Sheeana directed Scytale to use a nerve gas that he had created on the Enhanced Face Dancers that had surrounded the vessel, and the gas's potency killed thousands of the Dancers. Duncan, before going into the heart of Synchrony, the Cathedral, armed some of the Bene Gesserit crew of the ''Ithaca'', such as [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mothers]] [[Calissa]] and [[Elyen]], with weapons to fight the Machines. This caused [[Khrone]], their leader, to become frustrated with the Battle, and race to the Cathedral to report to the Machine Lords.

===Destruction of Synchrony===
After he left,  Leto communicated with [[Monarch]] and the rest of the sandworms in the ship's hold, and he told Sheeana that they desired to be released out into the semi-arid world. Sheeana knew of their destructive power, and together they released the sandworms into the Machine capital. Guided by Leto and Sheeana, the worms destroyed much of the Machine city as they burrowed deep into the planet's crust, and as they came up they shattered many of the flow-metal buildings and plazas.

===Events in the Cathedral===
As Sheeana, Leto, and Scytale continued their destruction of the minions and buildings of Synchrony, galaxy alerting events occurred in the Cathedral. The two gholas of Paul Atreides and [[Paolo]] battled and dueled to Paolo ending up in a coma, and Omnius was banished permanently to another plane of existence by [[Oracle of Time]].

The loss of the Omnius [[Evermind]] contributed even more greatly to Sheeana and Leto's guidance of the worms destruction, as the robotic machines were near paralyzed in dealing with the worms as they coursed through their main city. In the Cathedral as he faced Duncan Idaho and Erasmus, and knowing that the machines were distracted by the melee; enabled Khrone, leader of the Enhanced Face Dancers, to declare that the time of Face Dancer hegemony over the [[Known Universe]] had arrived. To counter this threat, Erasmus then activated his long before-placed "[[kill switch]]" he had put into their genetic make up hundreds of years before, and using the galaxy-wide tachyon net, all of Khrone's Face Dancers throughout the Known Universe were instantly killed.

Before the sandworms could reduce all of Synchrony to rubble, the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], Duncan Idaho, was revealed. He shared throughout flow-metal memory with Erasmus, creating a man/machine super-being who would guide the galaxies in a future of peace and prosperity.

===Good Bye to Leto===
No longer needing to guide the sandworms on a course of destruction, Leto mused with Sheeana over the prior friendship that they had shared since his decanting years earlier. Sheeana realized the great burden that her friend Leto carried with him, that the "pearl of awareness" of Leto was in each and every sandworm of the universe. Knowing that Leto would be happiest when embonded as one with the giant creatures, she watched as he placed his body as a type of genetic material inside on the worms ring casings. Leto merged with the worm, and became this time, a non-conscious human/sandworm genetic entity

==Bene Gesserit School on Synchrony==
Duncan guiding the future of mankind, decided to give Synchrony all factions of the Known Universe, as a type of peace monument to the cooperation of all races. Sheeana, with the approval of Murbella, founded a completely separate Bene Gesserit school out of the remains of the ''Ithaca'' near the Cathedral. With her on the planet was Scytale, who was allowed to start a re-built of the Tleilaxu culture on a different part of the world.

To show complete cooperation was the remains of the Thinking Machine Empire, in the form of semi-independent robots that also lived on the planet. Sheeana also raised up, with Scytale's help, a ghola of Serena Butler, and she was being raised to be a successor to the Fremen leader.

**[[Sietch Tabr]]|image=Stilgar3.jpg}}

'''Naib Stilgar''' was a [[Fremen]] who was the [[Naib]] of [[Sietch]] [[Sietch Tabr|Tabr]] and the Governor of [[Arrakis]] from [[10196 AG]] onwards. He was a close friend and chief advisor to [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides|Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|?-10191}} ===
Stilgar was born at some point in time on Arrakis, and became Naib of Sietch Tabr after calling the previous Naib out. He had two wives, one of whom was [[Tharthar]].

=== Desert War {{C|10191-10193}} ===

==== Change of fief ====
Upon the change of the Arrakis fief in [[10191 AG]] from [[House Harkonnen]] to [[House Atreides]], Stilgar was befriended by Atreides [[Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]], who had been sent in advance by [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] to gauge and study the Fremen. In Idaho's reports to Leto, Idaho had judged Stilgar to be a 'good example' of the Fremen of Arrakis. Indeed, through Idaho's relationship with Stilgar and his tribe, he became so impressed with the Fremen and their ways that Idaho accepted dual loyalties to the Atreides and to Stilgar.

==== Open war ====
After House Harkonnen [[Siege of Arrakeen|attacked]] Arrakis and House Atreides went renegade, beginning the [[Desert War]], the remaining members of the Atreides family, namely the Ducal heir [[Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], sought refuge with Stilgar and his tribe, who spared them after trying to take their water and being bested. Stilgar soon became a good friend of Paul's. However, over time, as Paul developed his [[prescience|prescient]] powers, Stilgar became more of a religious follower. As the War reached it's climax, Stilgar fought during the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]].  

=== Later life {{C|10193-10219}} ===
Paul became Emperor in [[10196 AG]] and Stilgar was granted the stewardship of Arrakis later that same year, also becoming a commander in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's loose Jihad]]. In [[10208 AG]], at the end of Paul's Jihad, Stilgar helped him settle the [[Tupile Treaty]] and the matter of the [[Ixian Confederacy]]. In [[10210 AG|10207 AG]], when Paul walked into the desert, blind, Stilgar executed the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Korba|Korba the Panegyrist]] and the Guild [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], disobeying Paul's prior orders against this.  

In [[10219 AG]], later in the regency of Alia, who had become possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Stilgar declared Sietch Tabr neutral in the war between the allies of the Lady Jessica and her grandchildren and Alia. However, he killed the Duncan Idaho ghola (Hayt) who was Alia's husband, after Duncan killed [[Javid]], violating sanctuary, and so was forced to turn against the Regent. After this, he was instrumental in allying the Fremen tribes with the allies of Jessica. Upon the ascension of [[Leto Atreides II]] not long after, Stilgar thought of a time earlier in the year when he thought of slaying Leto while he was sleeping, and privately noted that it was now 'too late'.   

=== Legacy ===
Stilgar lived a long and prestigious life, thanks in no small part to his diet of [[Spice Melange|spice melange]], a pervasive ingredient in all Fremen food and drink. Stilgar's descendants flourished well into the reign of [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], and probably beyond. He wrote a preface for the book ''"Muad'Dib, The Man"'' for the Princess [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]]. Long after his death, his seed cells were among those stored in the nullentropy tubes of the Tleilaxu Masters. 

== Physical appearance ==

Stilgar was a thin man, with darkly veined hands a thin nose and a full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard.

Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)
{{Original}}

{{disambigLink|[[Paul Atreides]]|Muad'Dib}}

[[File:Muaddib.png|thumb|The mouse shadow in the second moon]]

'''Muad'Dib''' was the name adopted by [[Paul Atreides]] after he was accepted by the [[Fremen]] as one of their own.

== Symbolism ==
The symbolic definition is broader in complexity. It is part the chosen name of manhood that [[Paul Atreides]] selects when he is accepted into the Fremen. It is one of two names that Paul maintains within the tribe. [[Stilgar]] explains that the first, Usul, means "strength of the base of the pillar". That it is his secret name, his troop name, that only Sietch Tabr may use and none other may presume.

The second name, Muad'Dib, is that by which he is known openly. Paul took the name from the small mouse of the desert and his choice pleased and impressed Stilgar, as well as other Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]].

{{quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib.|Stilgar|Dune}}
The English pronunciation of this word calls for a short "i", there is an almost identical word in Arabic, مُؤَدِّب ''mu'addib'', which means "private tutor" or "teacher". It used to be that the Caliphs, the rulers of the Muslim world, would hire a ''mu'addib'' to teach their children. The practice seemed to be common for other strata of society as well.

== Paul-Muad'Dib ==

Paul is reluctant to throw away his full past and get rid of the full name his father gave him, which is why he first wished to be called Paul-Muad'Dib. Unfortunately, this name was soon forgotten and became simply "Muad'dib". Also, it was hoped that by keeping the name his father gave him, he could prevent the mass slaughter that would occur later in his name. Sadly, he could not.

The meanings of both Usul and Muad'Dib have powerful ramifications and foreshadowing for the purpose Paul has on Arrakis.

After escaping the successful invasion of [[Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen]], and proving their value to the [[Fremen]], [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and his mother [[Jessica Atreides]] were accepted into [[Sietch Tabr]] by the [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]].

[[Paul Atreides|Paul]] was instructed to take a [[Fremen]] word as his new name. While lost in the deep desert prior to being intercepted by [[Stilgar]] and his clan, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] had spotted a small but nimble creature foraging on a rock outcrop. The creature had been a [[desert mouse]]. Upon asking the name of the creature, and being told it was called ''"Muad'Dib"'' by the [[Fremen]], he chose it as his new name.

[[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] choice in name was also marginally influenced by the prescient visions he had begun to have after arriving on [[Arrakis]]. In one recurring vision he saw throngs of [[Fremen]] chanting the word ''"Muad'Dib"'' at him in a subservient manner.

'''Duncan Idaho''' was originally a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Ginaz Swordmaster]] in the service of the honorable [[House Atreides]] during the last days of the [[Corrino Empire]], and one of the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]]'s right-hand men, with [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat]], and regarded as something of a ladies' man.

After falling in the [[Desert War]] on [[Arrakis]], he grew in importance from this relatively obscure role through a series of [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[ghola]] incarnations over the next five thousand years, first playing a key role as a Mentat in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|the final plot]] against [[Padishah Emperor|Pa]] n becoming the husband of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]], which was followed by his time as the [[Commander]] of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]]'s forces, and finally as an important figure in [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|the war]] between the [[Bene Gesserit]] and [[Honored Matres]].

== Biography ==
=== Original life {{C|?-10191}} ===
{{Quote|Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldier. Atreides field-hand on the field of battle.|[[Bijaz]] describing ther original Duncan to [[Hayt]]|Dune Messiah}}

==== Early life  ====
Duncan was born and raised on [[Giedi Prime]].<ref name=":5">[[Heretics of Dune|''Heretics of Dune'']], Chapter 3 (''Bene Gesserit Analysis'') - "Gammu . . . the original Duncan Idaho was born and raised there."</ref> His sister died there as a victim of the Harkonnens.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 5 - "“Your sister died there, a victim of the Harkonnens".</ref> He was rescued from Harkonnen bondage by the [[Old Duke|Old Duke Atreides]]<ref>''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', Chapter 31 (''Songs of Gurney Halleck'') - "Duncan saw only the face of the Old Duke telling him to obey. It was too much."</ref> and came under the service of the Atreides on [[Caladan]] after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens. He was then trained on [[Ginaz]] where he graduated as a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 4 (''Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries'') - "There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz..."</ref><ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', Chapter 3 (''Tleilaxu Theorem'') - "The body was sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School."</ref>

==== Atreides service  ====
The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], the concubine of the Old Duke's son [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgment was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with the Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]], a man who was also rescued from Giedi Prime by the Old Duke. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education. 

===== War of Assassins with Grumman =====
At some point, a [[War of Assassins]] [[War of Assassins of Houses Ginaz and Moritani|ignited]] between [[House Ginaz]] and [[House Moritani]], the ruling class of the planet [[Grumman]], in which he emperors of [[House Corrino]], particularly [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], supported House Moritani, and [[House Atreides]] supported House Ginaz.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', "Terminology of the Imperium"</ref> This war was Duncan's first real experience in mortal combat and was where he first killed, slaying a Harkonnen.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 17 (''The Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib'') - "My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon ... Harkon ... killed ’im f’r th’ Duke."</ref>
[[File:Dune 2020 Duncan Idaho.jpg|thumb|Duncan as Atreides Swordmaster]]

=====Move to Arrakis  =====
Later, when the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief under the order of the [[Emperor|Padishah Emperor]] in [[10191 AG]], Idaho went a week early to the desert planet to lead the second wave onto the planet.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 4 (''A Child's History of Muad'Dib'')</ref> Encountering [[Stilgar|Naib Stilgar]] and [[Sietch Tabr]], he later became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 12 (''Manual of Muad'Dib'')</ref>

===== Death =====
When the Emperor launched [[Siege of Arrakeen|an attack]] on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho escaped the massacre. He initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes, Lady Jessica and Paul, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar.<ref name=":0">''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 25 (''Arrakis Awakening'')</ref>

Duncan was killed by one by a blow to the head, but not before he dispatched no less than nineteen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly.<ref>''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]'', Chapter 32 (''Stilgar’s Report to the Landsraad Commission'') - "The Sardaukar who’d slain him reported his prowess: nineteen of their number dispatched by Idaho before he’d fallen."</ref> In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], allowing them to escape in an ornithopter.<ref name=":0" />
===First rebirth {{C|10196-10219}}===
After Paul's ascension to the throne in [[10196 AG]], Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]], a clone made by the [[Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as '[[Hayt]]' in his ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', Chapter 6 (''The Emperor Paul Muad’dib'')</ref>

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In the ensuing trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a [[Bene Tleilax]] plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], but only if he abdicated his throne.<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]],'' Chapter 23 (''Children's Verse'')</ref>

====Second death====
[[File:Dune stilgar wierds out on duncan|thumb|Duncan confronts Stilgar shortly before his second death]]
Idaho married [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], in 10210. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. 

In 10219, in order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed [[Javid]], Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Duncan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.<ref>''[[Children of Dune]]'', Chapter 55 (''The Story of Liet-Kynes'')</ref>

=== Incarnations under Leto II {{C|10219-13728}} ===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for 3,508 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times, and as leader of the [[Fish Speakers]]. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience and memories of all his ancestors, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The [[ego-memories]] of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.
[[File:Duncangod.webp|thumb|Duncan in the chambers of the God Emperor]]
The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of religious tyranny and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm). 

Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes".<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 7 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref> In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself, and in at least one instance he died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin - in another, he died under a Sardaukar sword, when Leto still used them as his fighting force. In one anomalous occasion, Idaho died in a 'thopter crash.<ref>''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', Chapter 42 (''Ancient Drinking Toast'')</ref> In another even rarer occasion, Duncan had accidentally blew himself up after an attempt on Leto's life which he abandoned when the Emperor convinced him he was doing the wrong, causing him to toss the explosive, in which the materials were unstable, to the side.<ref name=":1">''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 5 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" since most Duncans only possessed the memories of the original Idaho. If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.

==== Suppression of Wallach IX ====
In 13650, Duncan was charged by Leto to travel to [[Wallach IX|Wallach IX,]] where he would extinguish the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on the planet in order to enforce Leto's ban of the ancient [[Order of Mentats]]. This brought him great pain, as he, a Mentat, was forced to suppress a school that trained people the way he was trained. 

During the suppression, he talked to Sister Tersius Helen Anteac, one of the Mentat trainees<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Chapter 27 (''The Coda'')</ref> who escaped the planet shortly after, renaming herself Tertius Eileen Anteac, under the name of which she would later try and kill the God Emperor. Other Mentat-Sisters escaped as well, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood. This incarnation of Duncan died just ten years after the suppression.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 17 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

==== Penultimate Incarnation under Leto ====
In his penultimate incarnation still serving the God Emperor, the one after his life in which he suppressed Wallach IX, Duncan had two children with the Fish Speaker [[Irti]] in [[Shuloch|Goygoa]]; one in 13712, and another in 13720.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 26 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref> In 13727 he made his last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun supplied to him by the Ixian Ambassador [[Iyo Kobat]]. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him.<ref name=":1" />

==== Last incarnation in Leto's service ====
After this last time in which he was killed by the God Emperor, a new Duncan was given to Leto by the Bene Tleilax in 13728. This Duncan fell in love with Siona Atreides, a girl hidden from prescience who rebelled against Leto, and became good friends with Siona's father and Leto's majordomo, Moneo Atreides, despite Moneo easily beating him in combat and thus shaming him later on.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 41 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

Ultimately, Duncan joined a final attempt on Leto's life with Siona and her assistant and co-conspirator Nayla. During the God Emperor's wedding with his love, the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree, Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by Nayla. Leto, Hwi and Moneo fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]], named after Duncan In dying, the God Emperor released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 53 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

===== After Leto's Death =====
After the assassination, Duncan had nine daughters and a thousand sons with Siona - these children and these children's children, and so on, were hidden from prescience. The significant descendants of these many children, which were said to have "Siona blood", meaning they were shrouded from the prescient vision, included [[Hadi Benotto]]<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 54 (''Excerpt from the Hadi Benotto secret summation on the discoveries at Dar-es-Balat'')</ref>, [[Darwi Odrade]], [[Lucilla]]<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Chapter 6 (''Leto II (The Tyrant)'') - “I have Siona blood. He cannot see me.”</ref>, [[Miles Teg]] and [[Sheeana Brugh]]. Duncan and Siona also inherited a portion of Leto's empire, which rapidly detoriorated into the [[Famine Times]] and the [[Scattering]].

Ultimately, long after the death of this incarnation, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola, born in 15216, survived.

===Final incarnation {{C|15216-15240}} ===
====On Gammu====
In 15229, on Gammu (formerly Giedi Prime), Duncan fled to an old Harkonnen no-globe with Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit [[bashar/XD|Bashar]], and Reverend Mother Lucilla, after an attack on the Bene Gesserit Gammu Keep. Miles Teg was commissioned to restore Duncan's memories, and managed to do so. Duncan, Teg and Lucilla were ambushed during an operation with the general Burzmali. Teg was captured but Duncan managed to escape with Lucilla.

When [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matre]], tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play when he overwhelmed Murbella in combat, and all of the memories of the hundreds of previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released. Duncan and Lucilla were located by Miles Teg and brough to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella in a no-ship. Duncan, Murbella, Lucilla, Sheeana Brugh, Darwi Odrade and Tleilaxu Master Scytale were put in the no-ship with a sandworm while Teg launched [[Battle of Rakis|a final suicidal defense of Rakis]].

==== Imprisoned on Chapterhouse ====
[[File:Chapter.jpg|thumb|Duncan was imprisoned inside a no-ship on Chapterhouse for ten years.]]
After the destruction of Rakis, the no-ship was brough to Chapterhouse in a no-ship, which became their prison, as well as Scytale's, by the Bene Gesserit. Over the next ten years, Murbella and Idaho sired four children. Idaho was then used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola. By this time, he had been allied with Reverend Mother [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] for some time, who stole the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Over the decade he spent imprisoned within the no-ship, he had continous visions of a pair of mysterious and powerful elderly-looking entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] and something he began to call [[Net, the|"the Net]]". He deducted that these beings had found a new way to apply the ancient theories of [[Holtzman]], and was almost certain they were the [[Ones of Many Faces]] who had chased the Matres back into the Old Empire.

==== Escape from Chapterhouse ====
In 15240, after Murbella became both Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit and Great Honoured Matre of the Honoured Matres, and began the combination of the two groups,  Duncan escaped with his ward, [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] and others aboard the no-ship into unchartered space to escape from the now-combined Gesserit/Matres group, the [[New Sisterhood]]. Exhibiting [[prescience]] abilities, Idaho was the only person that could see the net that Daniel and Marty cast to ensare the no-ship. To escape this net, Duncan Idaho deleted all of the navigation records of the no-ship, rendering those onboard truly lost. Duncan and the others' fate from this point remains unknown.

== Abilities and skills ==
''Note:'' As originally the memories of each rebirth of Duncan would pick up with his death on Arraksi, some incarnations had abilities which others did not. All of the following, however, were possessed by his final incarnation, who regained the memories of all of his previous lives.

* '''Swordfighting''': Duncan was trained as a Ginaz Swordmaster, which made him an adept at swordfighting, giving the Atreides a great warrior. Duncan's abilities in this area were demonstrated in multiple instances, perhaps the most notable being his killing of a full nineteen Sardaukar, the finest warriors in the Imperium, in a short time before his first death. This was one of the many motivations of the original taking of his cells by the Emperor's warriors, as well as one of the reasons why the God Emperor appointed him as Commander of his forces and continously brought him back and why the Bene Gesserit continued to resurrect him after Leto II's death. 
* '''Resistance to [[Voice/XD|Voice]]''': In his original lifetime, Duncan was taught by Paul Atreides the techniques used to resist the Bene Gesserit Voice of command, an ability which gave the Sisterhood less power over him, such as when the Reverend Mother Lucilla tried and failed to use Voice on Duncan in his final incarnation on Gammu.
* '''[[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] training''': In his first rebirth as the ghola Hayt, Duncan was trained by the Bene Tleilax as a Mentat in addition to a Zensunni philosopher. The God Emperor later trained him as a Mentat in a few of his later incarnations.
* '''[[Truthsayer]]''': Leto II also trained him as a Truthsayer in a few of his lives.

== Relationships ==

=== Paul Atreides ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Duncan had a close bond with his beloved Duke's son Paul, who he taught in swordfighting from his earliest years, and Paul was greatly distraught when he fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis, saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, Paul found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Stilgar ===
{{Quote|Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho. The body of [[Turok | our friend]] remains with [[Leto Atreides I | your Duke]]. His water is [[House Atreides | Atreides]] water. It is a bond between us.|Stilgar shortly after the agreemenet of Duncan's duel alleigance|Dune (novel)}}When Duncan was sent by the Duke Leto to make contact with the Fremen, the first he befriended was Stilgar, Naib of Sietch Tabr, which was the first sietch which Duncan found. In the relatively short time the two knew each other, they grew great respect for each other, Stilgar aknowledging that Duncan measured well in his sietch and observed the customs and honor among the Fremen people. Because of this, when Stilgar met the Duke Leto they agreed that Duncan would have duel alleigance to the Atreides and the Fremen. 

Eighteen years later, when Duncan's first ghola Hayt was presented to Paul, Stilgar initially mistrusted Hayt, declaring that Duncan was dead and this was not him, but ultimately grew a new friendship with the ghola, which grew even deeper when Hayt's memories were restored. At the last, however, Stilgar and Duncan were enemies once more; after Duncan murdered Javid and gave Stilgar the three greatest Fremen insults, he was forced by his honor to finally kill Idaho, an act which Duncan nevertheless called the right choice and one which forced him to subsequently move against the Regent Alia.

=== Bijaz ===
{{Quote|We are like brothers. We grew in the same [[axlotl tank | tank]]: I first and then you.|Bijaz describes his connection with Duncan while imprisoned in [[Arrakeen]]|Dune Messiah (novel)}}
Duncan first met the dwarf Bijaz as Hayt, before he regained his original memories. He took an instant dislike to him, mistrusting the dwarf and being wary in his presence and particularly distraught at Bijaz's provocative use of his original name of Duncan Idaho. However, Hayt and Bijaz also had a fundemental connection in that they had been grown in the same Tleilaxu axolotl tank, making Bijaz compare them to brothers.

During Hayt's conversation with Bijaz after their initial meeting, the ghola noted that he radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observor think of ancient idols and threatened to order a guard to strangle him in an attempt to indimiate the dwarf, who also was not fond of Hayt, calling him a callous lout. When Hayt asked what Bijaz planned to do with him, he said that he would do him a simple kindness. Following the reawakening of Duncan's memories in Hayt, Paul ordered him to kill Bijaz before he succumbed to the Tleilaxu plan, and Duncan obeyed without hesitation, saying that he had been the one to do Bijaz the 'kindness.'

=== Moneo Atreides ===
Over many ghola incarnations in the latter days of the reign of Leto II, the God Emperor's majordomo Moneo Atreides grew a great affection for Duncan, although after each rebirth Duncan experienced meeting Moneo all over again. Duncan's last incarnation under Leto II, the one which assassinated him, was at one point easily bested by Moneo in combat, embarrassing him and creating somewhat bitter feelings between them, although the majordomo later apologised.

=== Schwangyu ===
During the long training of his final incarnation in the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu, Duncan had many Bene Gesserit teachers, but he despised none above the Reverend Mother Schwangyu, who was a member of the faction who opposed Mother Superior Tararza and also became a traitor to the Sisterhood for the Bene Tleilax. He eventually repeated the private mantra, 'Damn Schwangyu!', and showed little if any regret for her murder by Honored Matres when the Keep was attacked.

== Behind the scenes ==

* Idaho is portrayed by the late [[America|American]] actor [[Richard Jordan]] in the [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film adaption]] of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. 
* [[James Watson]] portrayed him in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 miniseries]] adaption, but for the 2003 sequel adaption of ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' and ''[[Children of Dune]]'', ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'', [[Edward Atterton]] was recast as Duncan to play his first [[ghola]] ([[Hayt]]). 
* In the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film adaptation]], Duncan was portrayed by ''Aquaman'' star [[Jason Momoa]].
* Alejandro Jorodowski wanted French actor Alain Delon to portray Duncan in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''. Delon is notably known to have been a screen sex symbol from the 1960s and 1970s.
* Duncan is the only character to make an appearance in all six of [[Frank Herbert]]'s original ''Dune'' novels, albeit in different incarnations. 
* The [[The Dune Encyclopedia|1984's Dune Encyclopedia]] - notably presented as a flawed in-universe document - states that Duncan is a native from Caladan. This is, like a number of other facts from that book, contradicted both by''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', where Duncan's ultimate ghola makes multiple mention of his childhood on Giedi-Prime. It's this later version that is expanded upon in [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s first book in their ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' trilogy: [[House Atreides]].

Mahdi
{{Original}}

[[File:Paul Administers the Oath of the Fedaykin (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb|Painting by John Schoenherr.]]

'''[[wikipedia:Mahdi|Mahdi]]''', Arabic "المهدي" (al-Mahdi, lit. "the Guided One") or "المنقذ" (al-Munqidh, lit. "the deliverer" ), was the name used by the [[Fremen]] to describe their saviour in their messianic legend. The term equated roughly to ''"The one who will lead us to paradise".''

==History==
In conjunction with the wider Fremen legend of salvation, the Mahdi was also known to be an off-worlder (i.e. not a native of [[Arrakis]]), and the child of a [[Bene Gesserit]]. Thus, after [[Paul Atreides]] fell in with the Fremen and first displayed his [[prescience]] and fighting skills, many Fremen gradually began to see the young [[Duke]] as the Mahdi.

The legend associated with the Mahdi was at least partially influenced by a long-standing [[Panoplia Propheticus]] by the Bene Gesserit's [[Missionaria Protectiva]] wing. Lady Jessica noted that the Mahdi legend's presence on Arrakis was an indication of just how awful conditions there were, since it was reserved only for those cultures where a Bene Gesserit would need to assume total control.

'''Ichwan Bedwine''' was a term used by by the [[Fremen]] to describe a brotherhood that encompassed all [[sietch]]es on the planet [[Arrakis]]. Thus, it was used to invoke unity and collective direction among the distant and sometimes discordant tribes.

The term was first used by [[Stilgar]] upon welcoming [[Paul Atreides]] into a permanent member of his sietch. Stilgar later remarked that Jamis would be given a proper parting ceremony as he was a member of the Ichwan Bedwine.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)]]''</ref>

Mapes
{{Original}}

[[File:Shadout Mapes with a crysknife (by John Schoenherr).png|thumb|Shadout Mapes with a [[Crysknife|crysknife]] (art by [[John Schoenherr]])]]

The [[Shadout]] '''Mapes''' was the head housekeeper in the Imperial Residence in the city of [[Arrakeen]] on the planet [[Arrakis]] when the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] took control of that planet in 10,191AG.

Mapes was one of the first [[Fremen]] that many of the Atreides encountered on a personal basis when they arrived on Arrakis. Mapes had approached the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] in the hopes of determining if she was the one the Fremen prophecies spoke of. In turn, Jessica managed to learn a great deal from Mapes regarding Fremen superstitions and legends implanted on Arrakis by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]]. In true Fremen fashion, Mapes kept a [[crysknife]] concealed on her person. However, when she determined that the Lady Jessica was indeed the [[Bene Gesserit]] the Fremen legends spoke of, she gave the [[knife]] to Jessica, who kept it on her thereafter.

Shortly thereafter, Mapes was almost killed by a [[Hunter Seeker]] meant for the [[Duke|Ducal]] Heir, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. In return for saving her life, Mapes informed Paul that the Fremen were aware that a traitor was among them. However, she did not know their identity.

When [[Wellington Yueh]], the House Atreides [[Suk Doctor]] dropped the house shields, he stabbed Mapes, who died trying to warn [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]].

Sandrider
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Otheym (Dune CCG, art by Mark Zug).jpg|thumb]]

'''Sandrider''' is the [[Fremen]] term for one who is capable of capturing and riding one of the great [[sandworm]]s of [[Arrakis]].

A Sandrider ready to catch a sandworm was called a Hookman, and a Sandrider riding a worm was called a Worm-Steersman.

In order to lead the Fremen, [[Paul Atreides]] had to become a sandrider. Normally, Fremen become sandriders by the age of twelve.

===Original Sandrider===

According to the [[Legends of Dune]] trilogy, the first Sandrider was a young [[Zensunni]] named Selim. Selim was exiled from his [[Sietch]] for water theft. However, Selim was not guilty of the crime but set up by a son of an elder village member. During his exile, Selim learned that if the segments of a worm were separated, then the worm would roll to keep the open wound from the abrasion of the sand. Using a small metal rod at first, Selim rode an ancient worm until the creature died. After several more rides, Selim decided it was not necessary to drive each worm he rode to death by exhaustion. He would then allow the worm to live, while he scurried to nearby rock formation to survive. Eventually, young Selim became known as [[Selim Wormrider]].

Ramallo
{{Original}}

'''Ramallo''' was the [[Fremen]] [[Sayyadina]], or rogue [[Reverend Mother]] of [[Sietch Tabr]]. She lived during the time [[House Atreides]] came to administer [[Arrakis]] under [[Imperium|Imperial]] decree in 10,191AG.

Ramallo was a Fremen woman who had taken the [[Water of Life]] and changed it successfully, thus unlocking her [[Other Memory]]. She was a mother figure and a woman of wisdom for the Fremen of Sietch Tabr. Upon their arrival, she accepted [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], a [[Bene Gesserit]] adept, and her son Paul, offering them both cryptic advice about the future.

When the Fremen of Sietch Tabr were forced to move deeper into the desert in response to increasing Harkonnen aggression, Ramallo declared that she was too old to survive the journey. Jessica succeeded Ramallo, who died just as Jessica successfully changed the Water of Life.

==Behind the Scenes==
It has been speculated, due to her behavior and her portrayal in the 2000 miniseries (Jessica refers to her as "one of our missionaries"), that Ramallo may have been an actual Bene Gesserit who had gone rogue, as opposed to simply occupying a position set up by the Sisterhood's [[Missionaria Protectiva]], who had planted myths and legends on Arrakis eons before the arrival of the Atreides. However, no direct evidence for this theory exists.

Jamis

**[[Sietch Tabr]]|image=Actually_Jamis.jpg}}{{Original}}


'''Jamis''' ([[10159 AG]] - [[10191 AG]]) was a [[Fremen]] of [[Sietch Tabr]], best known as the man who was bested by [[Paul Atreides]] when he and his mother [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] were first given sanctuary by [[Stilgar]]. He was also known to be adept in playing the nine-stringed [[baliset]].

== Biography ==

=== Earlier life {{C|10159-10191}} ===
Jamis had a reputation for fighting ferociously. He was regarded as a good Fremen, but encumbered by the major flaw of faulty self-control. Undoubtedly, Jamis' greatest usefulness to the tribe lay in his superiority as a fighting man; as a raider he was formidable. Stilgar in his Chronicle pays tribute to Jamis' bravery and skill. Even though Stilgar once bested Jamis in a fight, Jamis did not hesitate to save Stilgar's life at [[Hole-in-the-Rock]]. Stilgar also spoke of Jamis sharing his water during the [[Siege of Two Birds]] and of his valiant sacrifice at [[Bight-of-the-Cliff]]. When a [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] patrol pinned down a troop from Sietch Tabr, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved. On the other hand, the fury that sustained him in battle also crippled him, for Stilgar had further noted: ''"There's too much violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader —too much [[ghafla]]."''

This exuberance, however, did not always work to his detriment; it won him a good Fremen woman, [[Harah]], for his wife. Jamis called out [[Geoff]], her mate, and bested him. Harah spoke fondly of Jamis. She noted that he loved their children; [[Kaleff]], Geoff's son, and [[Orlop]], their own. He made no distinction between them and accorded the same devotion to their upbringing. Presumably he taught his sons the rules of water discipline and the Fremen way of fighting.

=== Duel and death {{C|10191}} ===
Jamis was numbered among the troop sent into the desert by [[Liet Kynes|Liet Kynes']] [[distrans]] message to seek the strangers, Paul Atreides and his [[Bene Gesserit]] mother. When the troop came upon them at [[Tuono Basin]], Jamis was distrustful of the outworlders and urged Stilgar to do his tribal duty - to eliminate those not trained to live with the desert. Although he agreed with Jamis regarding Jessica, Stilgar saw value in Paul. Unfortunately Jamis never realized the breadth of that value; he attributed Paul's disarming him at the moment Jessica overpowered Stilgar to "witch-force". Burning with resentment at being bested by a mere "child," Jamis invoked the [[Amtal Rule]] once they reached the [[Cave of Ridges]]. Unconvinced by Jessica's mystical performance, he demanded the right to test her part in the legend through [[Duel between Paul Atreides and Jamis|combat with]] her champion, Paul.

Jessica and Stilgar tried both persuasion and trickery to convince him otherwise, but Jamis persisted. Although Jamis was an expert with the [[crysknife]] in either hand, he was no match for one steeped in the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and trained by the likes of [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]]. He could have had no conception of the exquisite fineness of Paul's skill. Jamis' death bought Paul his sietch name, [[Usul]], and made him one of the [[Ichwan Bedwine]] with the manhood name of Paul-Muad'Dib. It was for Jamis that Paul 'Gave water to the dead', shedding a tear at his unnecessary death.

=== Legacy ===
Befitting a man of his standing, Jamis was given a full ritual funeral. Paul received Jamis' water, as was the custom, and inherited his [[yali]], or possessions (excluding the funeral gifts), and woman, Harah. Specifically, Paul received Jamis' [[coffee]] service and a bundle of [[Water Rings|water rings]], Stilgar's pick from the yali as his combat reward, and Paul himself chose Jamis' baliset, as it reminded him of his old teacher, [[Gurney Halleck|Gurney]]. The whole tribe rightly mourned Jamis' passing, for indeed, they all felt the loss on the unfortunate day that his temper drove him to challenge Paul Atreides. Jamis seemed to embody the best and worst of Fremen qualities: strength, superb fighting ability, desert wisdom, tribal loyalty, dedication to Fremen dreams and ideals, and closed-minded, bull-headed stubbornness.

'''''"The Songs of Muad'Dib"''''' by the [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan]] preserves for us the ''"Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain"'':

''Do you wrestle with dreams?''

''Do you contend with shadows?''

''Do you move in a kind of sleep?''

''Time has slipped away.''

''Your life is stolen.''

''You tarried with trifles,''

''Victim of your folly.''

Duncan Idaho/Featured
{{FeatArchive}}

[[Image:8969-5459.gif|right|thumb|200px|Duncan Idaho, as portrayed by actor Richard Jordan in the 1984 ''Dune'' Movie]]
'''Duncan Idaho''' was a swordmaster in the service of [[House Atreides]], and one of [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]]'s right-hand men, with [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Thufir Hawat]].

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Idaho was born on [[Giedi Prime]]. At an early age he and his family felt the wrath of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]]: his family was murdered by them, and Idaho was trained to be hunted for sport. However, Idaho escaped his captors and found his way to [[Caladan]], where he eventually ended up in the service of [[House Atreides]]. He rose up to eventually become the Duke's swordmaster and trusted advisor.

===Atreides Service===
Duncan came under the service of the Atreides after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens. The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgement was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

A graduate of the [[House Ginaz|Ginaz]] school, Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul (and possibly the Duke's armies) in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]]. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was be regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education.

===Move to Arrakis===
When the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief, under the order of the [[Emperor]], Idaho became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.

When the Emperor launched an attack on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho was killed by the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]] by a blow to the head, but not before he despatched no less than seventeen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly. In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]].

==Rebirths==
===First Rebirth===
After Paul's ascension to the throne, Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]], a clone made by the [[Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as 'Hayt' in his ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In ensuing the trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a [[Bene Tleilax]] plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife Chani, but only if he abdicated his throne.

Idaho married [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]]. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. In order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed Javid, Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[naib]] [[Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Ducan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.

===Subsequent Rebirths===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for approximately 3,500 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The ego-memories of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.

The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of godhood and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm). Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes". In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself. After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" (as the Duncans only possessed memories of the original Duncan). If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.

After the death of Leto II, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola survived.

===Final Incarnation===
[[Miles Teg]], the Bene Gesserit [[Bashar]] was commissioned to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho and managed to do so. However, when [[Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play, and all of the memories of the previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released.

Idaho was later used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola, but later escaped with his ward and [[Sheeana]] into unchartered space to escape from the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Honored Matres]].

==Appearance==
Duncan Idaho was said to be very handsome. He had black, curly hair and a dark complexion. During the days of the original Duncan Idaho he was regarded as something of a ladies' man.

== Behind the Scenes ==
Idaho is the only character to appear in all six original [[Frank Herbert]] ''Dune'' novels, albeit in different incarnations. Despite only having a relatively minor appearance in the original ''Dune'', the character was to become a focal point of the over-all saga, and his existence as a series of gholas was to serve an ultimate purpose.

In the 1984 '''Dune''' movie, Duncan Idaho was played by late actor Richard Jordan.

Sandworm/Featured
{{FeatArchive}}

The '''sandworm''' is a native lifeform of the planet [[Arrakis]]. It lives in the vast sand dunes that stretch across the surface of the planet, and is a by-product of the same process that creates the [[Spice Melange]].

Sandworms typically stay beneath submerged in the sand, although occasionally they will surface. They are attracted to rhythmic vibrations, including human footsteps, which perturb them and will cause them to attack the source.

[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|Sandworm, from the cover of 'Heretics of Dune', published by ACE Books.]]

== Physical Characteristics ==
Sandworm can grow to a huge size. Specimens up to 400 meters long have been spotted by humans in the [[deep desert]]s of Arrakis. They naturally live to a great age, ranging in the thousands of years, unless killed by humans or other sandworms.

In appearance their skin is thick and protective. It is comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size, that overlap to form an armor to protect against sand abrasion. But as the [[Fremen]] discovered, prying one or more scales up causes irritation. The sandworm will roll itself until the prone scale is at the highest point from the desert floor, so as to avoid sand getting trapped beneath it. This weakness is used by the [[Fremen]] to control the direction and speed of the creature, thus making them a viable method of transporting people.

Internally the sandworm is a massive furnace, producing almost unimaginable heat. The forward end of the creature possesses a huge yawing mouth that can easily consume large ground vehicles, including [[spice harvesters]]. A strong flinty, cinnamon smell exudes from the open mouth of the '''sandworm'''. The '''sandworm''' is highly susceptible to water poisoning.

== Creation of Sandworms ==
The sandworm is created when [[sandtrout]] band together after converting water deep beneath the surface of [[Arrakis]] into a liquid chemical that the '''sandworm''' is capable of digesting without being poisoned. This chemical then erupts up to desert's surface in a [[Spice blow]].

The sandtrout that survive this event then coalesce and are metamorphasized into a young sandworm.

== Cultural Impact of the Sandworm ==
Up until the ascendancy of [[Paul Atreides]] to the position of Emperor, the '''sandworm''' had virtually no impact on the humanity outside [[Arrakis]].

Yet to the planet's [[Fremen]] population it was a spiritual symbol of their faith, who saw the creatures as physical embodiments of the One God of their original Zensunni religion. Within Fremen culture the '''sandworm''' had several additional names, notably [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously means 'Old Man of the Desert', 'Old Father Eternity', and 'Grandfather of the Desert', as well as alluding to its perceived deific qualities.

Young '''sandworms''' are also sought by the [[Fremen]] for special ceremonies. When poisoned with water, the young '''sandworm''' is killed, but not before it chemically alters some of the water and expels it through its mouth. This liquid, known to the [[Fremen]] as the [[Water of Life]], is used to induct new [[Bene Gesserit]] reverend mothers. The toxic liquid forces the prospective reverend mother to either purify the water or die. During this process dormant [[genetic memories]] and other abilities are activated, heralding the creation of a new reverend mother.

After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the [[Zensunni]] religion, the reverence paid to the '''sandworm''' spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II]], in no small part because of his merger with sandtrout to form a hybrid human-sandworm being.

== Decline of the Sandworm ==
The terraforming of [[Arrakis]] posed a grave risk to the '''sandworm''', which found life outside the arid desert poisonous. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself had devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the '''sandworm''' once again thrive on Arrakis for a few thousand years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during [[the Scattering]]. The exact success of these samples remains unclear as of the end of ''''Chapterhouse: Dune''''.

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on [[Arrakis]], including the '''sandworm'''. But not before their enemies had spirited away at least one more of the creatures, which accompanied them on their escape from the unified [[Bene Gesserit]]/[[Honored Matres]] organization and into uncharted space.

}}





'''Paul Atreides''' was the last Duke of [[House Atreides]], the leader of the [[Fremen]], and the first [[House Atreides|Atreides]] Emperor. He was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]: the powerful [[Prescience|prescient]] being long sought by the [[Bene Gesserit]]. He was known by many names throughout his life, including [[Muad'Dib]], [[Usul]], and [[The Preacher]].


== Upbringing ==
As the son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his official concubine, Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-covered planet of [[Caladan]], the ancestral home of [[House Atreides]].

Paul was a product of the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Breeding program|breeding program]], which had brought together his parents with the intention of producing a female who could mate with the heir to [[House Harkonnen]], and produce the fabled [[Kwisatz Hadarach]]. However, the plans of the [[Bene Gesserit]] were thrown into turmoil by the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica's]] longing to give her beloved partner a male heir to his House.

Under the supervision of the [[mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat]] and military experts [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]], Paul was raised to be the heir of [[House Atreides]], one of the most powerful, respected, and moral Great Houses in the [[Corrino Empire]]. He showed ample talent, both physically and intellectually, earning him attention, especially by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who hoped to salvage their breeding plans.

== Transformation on Arrakis ==
[[Image:Newman Paulatreides.jpg|thumb|left|[[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]] as '''Paul Atreides''' in the Sci-Fi Channel [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|miniseries]]. ]]
Paul Atreides accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] was relocated to the desert world [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange]]. However, when the deception of [[House Harkonnen]] and the Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] was revealed, he escaped into the desert with his mother and joined the [[Fremen]]. Upon joining the desert people he took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]].

This experience, coupled with significant exposure to the [[Spice Melange]] triggered dormant prescient abilities within Paul's bloodline. These abilities, coupled with his leadership skills, his military training, and an ancient prophecy of the people of [[Arrakis]], enabled Paul to become the leader of the formidable [[Fremen]].
It is on Arrakis that he discovers that his grandfather - the father of Jessica - was the Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]]. He also drank the [[Water of Life]] and survived, expanding his consciousness bringing his prescience near to perfection. He is the first and last male to drink the Water of Life and survive, showing himself to be the Kwisatz Haderach.

During this period Paul met and fell in love with [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], the daughter of planetologist and native [[Fremen]] [[Liet Kynes]]. Their first son, [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]] was murdered by [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]], further fueling the existing enmity between [[House Atreides]] and [[House Harkonnen]].

After spearheading a highly effective campaign of [[wikipedia:guerilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] against the [[House Harkonnen]] and [[Sardaukar]] forces that had taken control of [[Arrakis]], Paul conquered the powers in [[Arrakeen]] and, thanks to the presence of Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], successfully negotiated the end of the long-standing [[Corrino Empire]] and his own ascendancy to Emperor.

== The New Empire, and The Golden Path ==
[[Image:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Paul becomes Emperor]] Upon crowning himself Emperor, Paul enacted [[The Golden Path]], a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire.

A result of this was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. After a bloody [[wikipedia:jihad|Jihad]] that lasted more than twelve years, Emperor Paul Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion through military and diplomatic coercion.

Paul's interpretation of [[The Golden Path]] also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.

==Final Days as Emperor==
Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]].

Additionally, doubts began to surface in his mind regarding his interpretation of the [[The Golden Path]]. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out.

That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, and became even more enticing following [[Chani Kynes|Chani]]'s death during childbirth. After being blinded during the atomic detonation of a [[stone burner]] in [[Arrakeen]] he disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]] in the traditional [[Fremen]] manner.

==The Preacher==
Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert.

By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.

The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront ALia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Duncan Idaho. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.

Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion.

While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transormation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.

==Behind the Scenes==
In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, McLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.

In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]].

Usul/DE
{{encyclopedia}}
'''Usul''' was a [[Fremen language|Fremen]] word meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar". It was also a figure of Fremen folklore that was later merged with the figure of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]].

==Legend==
Many legends existed about the life and deeds of Usul, both before and after the appearance of Paul Muad'dib.

According to a legend "How Muad'dib took his name", recorded in [[Ibarhimal-Yazizh]]'s ''[[Fremen Folktales from Onn]]'' SAH 313, Usul was "a King's son". 

In this version, Usul was still a boy when he decided to leave his [[sietch/DE|sietch]] before his ''[[minha]]'', the season of testing, as his mother reminded him. Nevertheless he left to the desert and as the sun was setting, he saw some little way off [[Kalatorano|a castle]] made all of sand. 

Inside the castle was a room, empty but for a table of sand on which stood a jug of [[liban]] and a bowl with some apricots and after he ate, he lay down to sleep. Then the voice of [[Alhen]] (Death), "Naib of All the Djinn" threatened him for entering his castle and eating his meal. 

Usul replied: ''"Jild an havy ma tumal minn-u harakis"'' (Shoes are not made of the hide of a living animal). Then the marid laughed and grabbed Usul by his hair and threw him into a pit in the center of the castle.

Usul sat at the bottom of the pit and a small mouse appeared and told him ''"Ya mawla, argab aanina!"''. Its wife gave birth and its tribe would starve without it, so it asked Usul to throw it over the pit. As Usul did this, the mouse replied ''"Tija al-sadaqa"'' "The gift will return to the giver" and Usul passed the rest of the night alone.

The next morning, the jinn grabbed Usul from his hair and threw him in the desert. 

===First djinn===
Then a mouse introduced as [[Mixabbi]] and advised Usul to learn from it. The mouse began to sniff the wind and to watch the spray of sand from the dune tops. Τhe mouse burrowed then stopped as the sand drifted down. When the mouse found the shadow of the wind, where the burrow did not collapse, it tunneled deeper and curled up inside with its nose deep inside its fur. 

The wind rose until before him there stood what seemed like a swirl of winds in the shape of a man, the Yellow Djinni [[Azfar]] who would eat Usul. Then following the mouse's example, he found the shadow of the wind on the lee side of a dune and crawled from place to place, testing the sand. When he found what the mouse had taught, he dug into the sand and
scooped himself a burrow. Usul waited until the storm blew itself out. 

Then Azfar told Usul that he won. If Usul ever became free, Azfar would do one service. 

===Second djinn===
When Usul tried to reply,  he foudn himself in a cavern. Then a mouse came, introduced as [[Rauhanin]] and showed him "peace": it hopped to the floor and crouched as if it were praying without moving no matter what Usul did. Thinking that the mouse was dead, put it on the floor again only to see it rise, shake itself, and run off as a distant rumble was heard until Usul's head rang. 

It was [[Ahmar]], the Red Djinni who would eat him. Usul thought he could bear no more of the loud beating, and fell to his knees, clutching his ears and grinding his teeth. Thinking of the mouse, he looked deeper and deeper inside of himself, for the small place where all is quiet. He looked and breathed from the center of his soul, and as he looked, he heard the drum less and less. Then he found the silent place, and rested there in reverence. 

Then, a pebble had fallen on him and Ahmar replied weakly and distantly when Usul becomes his own master, the djinni would do him a service. 
===Third djinn===
Usul found himself on an omnidirectional gray floor, stretching as far as he could see all round him, with a gray sky over all. Then a mouse came and introduced as [[Basbasiyah]]. It lept to the floor and began to wiggle its tail, hpping, jumping and dancing until Usul laughed. 

A drop of water fallen on his face and through moans and sad noises, from a dask cloud caame a sorrowful voice. It was [[Abiad]] the White Djinni that would eat him. He saw his mother and sister sorrowful for missing him. Usul started crying and feeling very sad and alone until remembered the mouse. He started laughing and before he knew it, the gray land was alive with his mirth and the echoes answered his laugh with giggles and chuckles. Then [[Abiad]] said that once he would free himself, he would not forget that Usul bested him.

Usul again found himself in the pit. It was night and once again fell to sleep. The morning Alhen again grabbed him and said that since Usul escaped his donkeys, whether he would do something to gain his freedom. But Usul would not ask anything. Then the Djinn asked from Usul [[portyguls]] from a garden. Usul said he would do it "but only because it pleases me to get some portyguls myself". 

As he left, he felt his own master again, and thought it was his ''[[al-awwal nahar]]'', for in wonders and adventures it has surely been 'the first day'. His [[hajra]] ended and he saw the garden, near sunrise.

He called [[Khala]], folk of the air to show him the portyguls. After he ate, he took three for the djinn, and then boasted that the garden is unguarded and any outcast would enter. The djinns replied that they were imprisoned there because he could not reach their hearth by nightfall. Then Usul realized he could not return to the same way because he would fail to return in time. 
===Return journey===
To that purpose he marked where the sun rose and set a course straight and fast for Alhen's castle. 

His path led him over a jagged rock wall, from which he looked at [[kaymus]], dust sand, in the basin. He ran down the slope, until he felt no ground and fell in a pit filled with ''[[bar almeda]]'' and sunk until could not breathe. Then he called Azfar. Since Usul was not free, the djinn asked for one of the portyguls. The djinn then lifted Usul from his cloak. Then a mouse came and Usul boasted. But the mouse replied "You had a djinni to help you. If a hawk should snatch me from a scorpion, that does not make the scorpion my slave nor the hawk my ally." 

As he crossed a low range of dunes. He stepped steadily across the salt basin, heading for a ridge of rock on the far side. When he came to the very middle of the place, he felt [[drum sand]] and this [[atambal]] would call a worm. The drum sand would give him firm footing, he knew, and he judged the distance to the rocks carefully. He then asked help from Ahmar. The djinn asked him for a portygul because he was not free, and with his drum he sped, luring the [[sandworm/DE|sandworm]]. Usul made his way to the rocks and sat down to catch his breath. Then a mouse came to whom Usul boasted but it replied "Make sure when you cross the desert you always have Ahmar's drum at your call and no worms will bother you." 

Usul thought as he proceeded that while he had not beaten the uncaring earth nor the greedy worm, and he was thirsty. 
Usul lay flat on the desert sands, too weak to move. Two mice came and talked about him. They said that this boy was not Usul master of Dune because he is not his own master. Then he called Abiad, to weep and slake his thirst. Once more, the djinn noted that Usul is not free.

But Usul replied that he is free because it's to his will to bear or to bow, to endure or to submit, and the mightiest
naib can say no more. If I were to die in chains, I will still have a freedom that no one can take from him.

The djinn again asked for a portygul as a reward but Usul said no, because he would eat it himself; he did not intend to return to Alhen.

Once he found himself in the pit with the djinn angry, since Usul broke his promise. But then, Usul gave him the portygul he still held. The djinn then realized it was bested and offered him anything, even the whole [[Arrakis/DE|planet]]. Usul denied saying that the djinn "can give me nothing that I lack or cannot get for myself". 

He took only a gift himself would give. A name: the name of his preceptors, whose teaching brought him through all troubles. The new name shall be called 'Mouse'.

==Paul Atreides==
It was the name given to [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] when he was given sanctuary with [[Sietch Tabr]] by its [[naib/DE|naib]], [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]]. Openly Paul was to be referred to as [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]]. However, Usul was the private name used within the Sietch. It was to be the name his beloved [[Chani/DE|Chani]] would use for him, and the last word she cried before she died giving birth to their children.

Stilgar gave Paul this name after witnessing him defeat one of their finest wariors, [[Jamis]]. It would appear that Stilgar saw a certain strength in the boy.

Ishmael
{{Expanded}}{{Character_infobox|name=Ishmael|birth=[[211 BG]]|birthplace=[[Poritrin]]|title=*[[Naib]] of the [[Wormrider]]s|family=*[[El'hiim]] (stepson)|debut=[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]|book name=[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]|loyalty=*[[Zensunni]]
**[[Free Men of Arrakis]]
***[[Freemen of Arrakis]]}}

'''Naib Ishmael''' [b. [[211 BG]]] was the [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] who formed the [[Free Men of Dune|Free Men of Arrakis]] from both slave refugees from [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]] and the outlaws of the late [[Selim Wormrider]], and became the first [[Naib]] of the Free Men. Later, he led the portion of the Free Men who became known as [[Freemen of Dune]] and later [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] into the deep desert. 

== History ==

===Slavery on Poritrin===
When he was only about 10 years old, he witnessed the arrival of [[Tlulaxa]] [[slavers]] [[Tlulaxa raid on Harmonthep|assaulting]] his village. He and his cousin [[Taina]] were captured and taken to [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]]. Initially he worked in the slimy mudflats of [[Isana]], scooping clam seedlings and rushing them out into the wet fields.

Soon he was moved to the mansion of [[Tio Holtzman]] and entered his team of [[solvers]]; he became friends with the unruly [[Aliid]] who was a [[Zenshiite]]. Aliid proposed him to make a prank by deliberately entering wrong mathematical formulas. Fortunately, the mistakes were detected by Holtzman who then punished his solvers.

Ishmael was transferred in a slave team that constructed a giant mosaic in a canyon wall of the [[Isana]] river. During the rebellion of [[Bel Moulay]], he and Aliid destroyed their own work on the mosaic, and then punished by whipping. The rebellion was soon quieted down and the two boys watched Bel Moulay's cruel execution, and was remembered for the years to come.

Years later, Ishmael had a wife, [[Ozza]], who gave him two daughters, [[Chamal]] and [[Falina]]. Ishmael grew with docile belief, remembering nostalgically the sutras and stories told to him by his grandfather. He recited them to his co-slaves, gave them courage and strengthened their faith, although the more defiant, Aliid, used to scorn his meekness.

Ishmael worked constructing the decoy fleet that fooled the machines during their [[attack against Poritrin]], and idea by [[Vorian Atreides]] that saved the planet. Moved by Aliid and others who demanded recognition for their labor and better living conditions, Ishmael audaciously attempted to meet and talk with Lord [[Niko Bludd]] personally. Because of his disrespect, he was separated from his family taken to work for [[Norma Cenva/XD|Norma Cenva]] with other 130 slaves.

During that time, Ishmael continued to preach and tell stories to the Zensunni comrades who came to him. The Zensiites with Aliid rested on different quarters. After some years, among a new batch of 30 slaves, Ishamel recognized his daughter, Chamal (with her husband [[Rafel]]) who were also taken to work for Cenva.
===Escape to Arrakis===
Soon, Ishmael learned of Aliid's and the Zenshiite's plot to revolt on the 28th anniversary of the rebellion on Poritrin. Ishmael was a pacifist, and preached non-violence - giving hope to other slaves by telling them that God will grant them freedom if they are patient.

During Aliid's slave revolt, Ishmael with the help of Rafel and others, forced [[Tuk Keedair]] to take his band of slaves to freedom. Keedair made sure to warn them that he is no pilot and the only coordination he remembered was of [[Arrakis]]. Eventually, using the [[space-folding]] technology, they arrived on the desert planet and crashed on the sand.

The slaves soon realized the world was hostile, with scarce moisture, no vegetation and poor fauna, under a hot sun. Several scouting attempts resulted in tragedy. After five months of waiting, 1/3 of the slaves were dead.

Then, [[Jafar]] found them, hearing the claims of Tuk Keedair about the lost slaves, and came to find them. He accepted them to the band of the [[Wormrider]] outlaws after the death of [[Selim Wormrider]] and the Poritrin slaves joined their population.

Ishmael met Selim's widow, [[Marha]], who indoctrinated the ideals of Selim. Ishmael took care of her son, [[El'hiim]], and even saved his life when it was endangered by [[Scorpion]]s in the desert. Eventually Ishmael and Marha felt a mutual attraction and they were joined in marriage. Around that time Ishmael became the [[Naib]] of the Wormriders' village

In the following years Marha died. El'hiim insisted that she would receive treatment from scientists of the [[Arrakis City]], but Ishmael, having now adopted the ideals of Selim, denied to trust the offworlders. Marha had listened to her husband and In El'hiim's view that had led directly to her death. Marha made Ishmael swear to shelter and advise her son.

When El'hiim grew up. he became the Naib of the [[Wormrider]]s but his stepfather perhaps had applied too much pressure, unwittingly forcing him to turn in another direction. El'hiim but was changed by the new experiences and was radically different than his father. To Ishmael's dismay, the young Naib trusted offworlders and insisted that they should buy commodities by trading spice.

Ishmael often scorned his stepson about their conflicting views, but respected his position as the Naib. Eventually the village was assaulted by [[slavers]] but they were repelled successfully.

Ishmael decided to re-educate El'hiim. They both went to a pilgrimage in the [[Tanzerouft]] riding a [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]], and make him remember the wild way of living on Arrakis. However on their return home, they found their village devastated by slavers who returned during their absence, kidnapping several young men and women. The young Naib realized from a fabric tissue that the attackers were from [[Zanbar]] and knew where they were.

El'hiim traveled to Arrakis City where the authorities promised to enforce certain regulations against kidnapping. Not trusting the word of the outsiders, Ishmael organised a meeting of the Zensunnis at their main settlement in the faraway cliffs. Accompanided by a reluctant El'hiim, they reached the slavers' camp; they counted about a dozen. After disabling the lighting with [[maula rifle]]s, they fell on them with their crystal and wormtooth [[knives]]. During the fray, Ishmael caught [[Wariff]], the unrepentant [[Tlulaxa]] man who saved years ago. Ishmael remembered the words of his aggressive friend Aliid and started to endorse them; he commanded his men to seek payment in blood and return it to the desert as water.

Following the successful kanla raid, Ishmael and El'hiim argued about Ishmael's violent attack on the slavers, particularly the draining of their enemies' blood to take their water. While El'hiim preferred trade and contact with offworlders, Ishmael advocated returning to the ways of Selim Wormrider and retreating to the deepest deserts. Unable to reconcile their differences, Ishmael challenged his adopted son to a duel and disowned him, slapping him twice as with the custom to invoke deep insult. With El'hiim unwilling to fight him, Ishmael demanded a sandworm duel. 

During the sandworm duel, Ishmael and El'hiim charged their sandworms at each other. However, the duel ended in El'hiim's favor when Ishmael lost control of his sandworm, allowing El'hiim's sandworm to gain the upper hand and drive his sandworm away. Having lost the leadership of the clan, a defeated Ishmael led several Zensunni supporters from El'hiim's village into the dangerous Tanzerouft desert. There, he and his followers vowed to build their own isolated settlements and avoid contact with outsiders.

'''High Priest Ziarenko Javid''' [d. [[10219 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] follower of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|"Muad'Dib"]] [[House Atreides|Atreides]], who was the High Priest of the [[Qizarate]] following the execution of the treacherous [[Korba]]. In his later years he became the lover of his sister, [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]].

== Biography ==
Javid was born in [[Sietch Jacurutu]] as the son of its [[Naib]], [[Namri]]. He was trained by his father to one day become one of the [[Water Stealers|water stealers]], but Javid left his father and the [[Iduali]] of Jacurutu, joining the [[Priesthood of Muad'Dib]] and rising to the [[Qizarate]], becoming High Priest in [[10210 AG]] after the execution of the previous High Priest, Korba, for his involvement in the [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|last conspiracy]] against the Emperor. 

In the last years of her regency, the [[ego-memory]] sceptre of the deceased [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] suggested that the Regent Alia take him as a lover. Soon after their relationship began, [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]], a [[Mentat]]-[[ghola]] and Alia's husband, surmised the affair and this severely angered him. During the revolt of the Naibs, Duncan killed Javid publicly in [[Sietch Tabr]], both as revenge and in an attempt to force the hand of Tabr Naib [[Stilgar]]. Indeed, his death provoked Stilgar to abandon his position of neutrality between Alia and the rebel Fremen by killing Duncan in turn.
==Behind the scenes==
The 2003 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'' indicates that Javid was still in league with the members of [[Sietch Jacurutu]] in his time as High Priest. He was also seen during the events of ''Dune Messiah'' as a child, helping Korba set the stoneburner.

'''Korba''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] follower of [[Paul Atreides|Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides]], the supposed [[Mahdi]]. Beginning his rise to power as one of the original [[Fedaykin]] who Paul trained in the [[Weirding Way]] during the [[Desert War]], he served as a commander in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]] which allowed Paul to usurp [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and become the [[Padishah Emperor]] and led to the Fremen waging [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a twelve-year galactic jihad]] in his name. 

After the Battle of Arrakeen, Korba was given the title of Panegyrist, becoming an important member of Paul's [[Qizarate]] and rose to the additional title of [[High Priest]] by the year [[10208 AG]]. It was at this point that Korba turned against his Mahdi, becoming embroiled in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a conspiracy]] to martyr the Emperor, a conspiracy whose leading instigators also included Princess [[Irulan Corrino]], Paul's wife in name only, [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Spacing Guild]] [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], and [[Scytale]], a [[Face Dancer]]. Korba was killed by [[Stilgar]] after his complicity in the conspiracy was discovered.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In the TV miniseries adaption of Children of Dune, Korba was portrayed by Czech actor Karel Dobrý, who also portrayed Liet Kynes in the original Dune miniseries. The motivation of Korba is altered in the miniseries so instead of a desire to martyr him so his religious power would increase drastically, Korba is a rebel hating the Atreides Empire. He is also seen to be a friend of the child Javid.

In the 1984 movie, it is speculated that the character Korba, who speaks the line at min 93.45 "If you be a Reverend Mother, let Shai-hulud judge now!" was played by Dennis Hopper in an uncredited role.

Pardot Kynes
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Pardo_&_Liet.jpg|thumb]]


'''Pardot Kynes''' [d. 10175 AG] was an Imperial [[Planetologist]] who studied [[Arrakis]]. He remained there and married a native [[Fremen]] woman, with whom he had his only child, [[Liet Kynes]].

Kynes was the first to be sent to study Arrakis, perhaps by [[Elrood Corrino IX]]. For Kynes, the planet was an expression of its [[Canopus|sun]]'s energy, ready to be reshaped

==Meeting with the Fremen==

[[File:Screenshot_2019-07-26-03-08-39-1.png|thumb]]

His opportunity to shape the planet came when he was exploring the landscape in a one-man [[groundcar]] behind the [[Shield Wall]], near the village of [[Windsack]], one hot afternoon when he stumbled onto six [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] bravos, [[shield]]ed and fully armed, bullying 3 [[Fremen]] youths. It was a common scene, more slapstick than real, but Kynes realized that the bullies intended to kill the boys; one was down with a severed artery, two of the bravos were down, but it was still four armed men against two.

Kynes triggered his own shield, waded in and had silently had two of the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip. He dodged a [[sword]] thrust, slit the third's throat with a neat entrisseur, and the remaining Harkonnen was felled by the two Fremen youths, as he saved the lad on the ground.

The Fremen were confused; he was a known Imperial servant, but was also an ally. The inexperienced youths by two days later, took him to Windshack owing him a mortal obligation. There he talked to the Fremen about water, grass, about palmaries filled with date palms and open qanats flowing across the desert.

Kynes never saw the behind-the-scenes debate raging all around him. He knew the location of a major sietch and talked like a madman, he was a water burden for the sietch and also a servant of the Imperium. He did kill Harkonnens but anyone had; he just saved three fool youths and had seen [[crysknives]]. Eventually the [[tau]] of the sietch voiced the decision.

Kynes was talking to a group that spread around him about open water, walking in the open without [[stillsuit]]s, and [[portyguls]], when [[Uliet]], an experienced fighter, was sent with a consecrated [[knife]] to kill him, with two [[watermen]] to get his water from the body. Kynes said "Remove yourself" to Uliet who stood before him, and went on talking about secret [[windtrap]]s, brushing past the man opening his for his ceremonial blow.

Uliet inexplicably, in a riddling gesture, perhaps motivated by Kynes' visionary words, walked three paces and deliberately fell on his own knife, thus "removing" himself.
=== Terraforming Arrakis ===


[[File:Pardotkynes.png|thumb|Pardot Kynes, by Dev Pramanik and Alex Guimarães, House Atreides Graphic novel ]]


This was taken to be a sign by the Fremen that Kynes was to be listened to. Eventually, most Fremen took to Kynes' vision for Arrakis' future. Kynes returned to his Imperial post, directing the [[Biological Testing Station]] bringing Fremen as personnel, stealing tools like [[cutteray]]s, used to dig underground [[catchbasin]]s and hidden windtraps and collect water in the basins.

Kynes was hailed as an [[umma]], a prophet. Men, women and children went anywhere he ordered, and many died during their "missions". He set up small-unit experiments with regular interchange of data for a swift [[Tansley effect]], accumulating millions of tiny information. He organized only isolated and rough run-through tests to put their difficulties into perspective.

Kynes had the Fremen collect copious amounts of data on the climate, biology and ecosystems of the planet. Through his research, [[sandtrout]] were discovered. Indeed, it was through the sandtrout that Kynes learned the relationship between the spice and [[Shai-hulud]].

After discovering how melange was created, Pardot Kynes turned his attention to planting greenery. First he began with a certain [[poverty grass]], then moved to others including:
* [[Poverty grass]]
* Ephemerals - [[chenopods]], [[pigweed]]s, [[amarinth]]
* [[Scotch broom]]
* [[Low lupine]]
* [[Vine eucalyptus]] (from [[Caladan]])
* [[Dwarf tamarisk]]
* [[Shore pine]]
* [[Candelilla]]
* [[Suguaro]]
* [[Bis-naga]]
* Shrubs and bushes, including [[camel sage]], [[onion grass]], [[gobi feather grass]], [[wild alfalfa]], [[burrow Bush]], [[sand verbena]], [[evening primrose]], [[incense bush]], [[smoke tree]], [[creosote bush]].

Following this, Kynes then introduced various animals, including:
* Burrowing animals: [[kit fox]], [[kangaroo mouse]], [[desert hare]], [[sand terrapin]]
* Predators, including the [[desert hawk]], [[dwarf owl]], [[eagle]], [[desert owl]]
* Insects, namely [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], [[trapdoor spider]], [[biting wasp]], [[wormfly]]
* The [[desert bat]]

Once Kynes saw the introduction of all these forms of life, he then began to plant more than two hundred different food plants, including [[cotton]], [[melon]]s, [[coffee]] and [[medicinal]]s.

Kynes married into a Fremen sietch and had a son, [[Liet Kynes]] whom he taught (along with the other Fremen children) ecology and the "language" of Arrakis, of its landscape, climate, seasonal limits, and finally how to break through all ideas of force into the awareness of order.

===Death===
However, he was killed in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] when Liet was nineteen. Liet continued his father's work, both in an official capacity as Imperial Planetologist, but also as Fremen leader, steering them as a people toward an ultimate goal, one that Pardot Kynes had envisioned would take approximately five hundred years. This plan, however, was interrupted and dramatically quickened by the arrival of [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]].

==Character==
Kynes was a direct and simple man in many ways. His single-mindedness was enormous, and approached any problem with a kind of innocence, but not naïveté; he merely permitted himself no distractions. Thus, he often appeared somewhat emotionless, but was kind and helpful nonetheless. His son Liet inherited both his mother's Fremen nature and his father's ecological talent and thus he was more emotional than Pardot.

Later, Farok was killed by [[Scytale]] shortly before he took [[Lichna]]'s identity

{{encyclopedia}}

It is mentioned that after the final victory on [[Molitor]] he and other [[Fremen/DE]] warriors celebrated in a great feast in [[Paul's Keep/DE]] and his first-hand account is quoted in the ''Encyclopedia''.<ref>Arrakeen Palace</ref>
==Behind the Scenes==
===Discrepancies===
Farok is initially described with a missing arm: "Scytale returned his gaze to the old man [Farok], noted the empty sleeve dangling from the left shoulder and the lack of a stillsuit." Only a few paragraphs later, however, Farok has mysteriously regained his arm: ""Thrice blessed," Farok said, folding his hands into his lap in the ritual clasp. They were old, heavily veined hands."

This has given rise to a running joke within the Dune fandom that Farok did in fact have ''three'' arms.

Farok was portrayed by Ivo Novák in the 2003 [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]] miniseries.

Warrick
{{Expanded}}

[[File:Fremen-cabalgusanos-by-aaron-miller.jpg|thumb|Fremen Wormrider by Aaron Miller]]

'''Warrick''' was a [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] from [[Red Wall Sietch]], the blood-brother of [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]] and first husband of [[Faroula]]. Friends from early childhood, Warrick accompanied Liet Kynes, on many of the routine and everyday occurrences that Liet experienced as a teenager. 

==Dominic Vernius==
As the two grew into men, they discovered the hidden hideout of the former [[Earl]] [[Dominic Vernius]] who had established an underground base on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]' [[Southern Polar Region]]. Discovered by the Earl's men while delivering the annual [[melange/XD|melange]] tribute to the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]], Warrick and Liet were led before the renegade nobleman. The exiled leader of [[House Vernius]] agreed to spare the lives of the young duo, and Warrick and Liet agreed to help the help Dominic better hide his base. Released by Vernius, Warrick and his close friend never told of the Antarctic location.

==Marriage to Faroula==
As the two progressed into adulthood, their eyes were caught by a young Fremen women named Faroula, daughter of the [[Naib]] of their sietch. Liet confided in Warrick that he had written poetry about Faroula, but the ever confident Warrick sadly stated that Liet would probably never share the words with her. Warrick further re-iterated that he, too, was interested in the teen Fremen maiden. Finally, Faroula issued a marriage challenge to both, including Warrick, leaving them a note in each of their quarters, that she could be found in the far away [[Cave of Birds]]. The first of the two young males to find her, would be her betrothed.

Warrick summoned a Giant [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]],and used his [[Maker hooks]] to guide the beast across the sands of [[Dune]]. Warrick arrived at the Cave just a few moments earlier than Liet did, and as Warrick and Faroula pledged their lives to each other, Liet slowly turned around, and did not interrupt his friend's tender moment.

==The Coriolis Storm==
Liet left the Sietch soon afterwards, embittered about his loss of the hand of Faroula, and headed for the Antarctic regions of the planet. Warrick and Faroula were formally married soon afterward, and within a year, their son, [[Liet-chih]] was born. A few months later, Liet gave word to the Sietch that he was returning to his extended family. Liet gave word to Warrick, and told him to meet him in the Southern Polar Region. Warrick was overjoyed, and the two had a short-lived reunion.

On the way back to their ancient homestead, a fierce [[Coriolis storm]] began to come near them from faroff in the desert. The sandworm that they were riding fled deep into the sand as the giant storm approached. A small out-cropping of rock, only big enough for one man, was the only shelter that the duo could find. The two lifelong friends struggled as to whom should use the rock shelter, as the other would almost certainly die, due to being exposed to the fercious sand winds. Warrick debated that Liet should use the shelter, as he was the son of [[Umma]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]]. Liet demanded that Warrick use the shelter, as he had a wife and child to take care of. As neither would "take no for an answer", and the storm was almost upon them, they left their fate to chance, to throwing [[stick]]s. Warrick cast first, and rolled a score of seven; Liet acquired a nine. As the two argued still further, the storm came upon them, and Warrick pushed Liet into the enclosure.

==The Water of Life==
Warrick was critically wounded and blinded, the skin scoured from his face and parts of his body, and Liet took him back to the Sietch. Warrick chose to drink the [[Water of Life]] in an attempt to discover more about the [[Lisan al Gaib]] and died in the process.

Leto was born on Arrakis to then-Padishah Emperor [[Paul Atreides]] and his [[Fremen]] [[concubine]] [[Chani Kynes]], the daughter of the great [[Liet Kynes]], just after his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides]]. He and his sister were preborn due to Chani's consumption of the spice melange in large amounts before her death. He was named after the [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]], his paternal grandfather, and [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], his older brother, who was murdered in infancy.

Seeing that their aunt, the [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], had been possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of her grandfather [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Leto II and Ghanima planned to prevent her from destroying the Atreides and preventing the [[Golden Path]], the salvation of humanity which Leto worked to bring about for most of his life. This period also saw them evade an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]] which resulted in the banishment of [[Wensicia Corrino]] by her son [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]], who became Ghanima's lover. Following Alia's suicide as well as the murder of his father Paul, Leto took the title of God Emperor and ruled over humanity with an iron fist for 3,500 years, guiding it away from extinction. 

==Biography==
===Upbringing {{C|10210-10219}}===
Leto II and his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] were born on planet [[Arrakis]] at the end of the reign of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]]. Their mother [[Chani]] died shortly after giving birth to the two children, mainly due to complications arising from large amounts of contraceptives that were surreptitiously given to her by Paul's legal wife [[Irulan Corrino]]. Paul had anticipated the birth of a daughter, Ghanima, due to his prescient visions. However, Leto's arrival came as a surprise to the [[Emperor]]. Both children were [[pre-born]].

Following Chani's death, and the apparent death of their father in the desert of Arrakis, Leto and his sister became the legal responsibility of Paul's younger sister, the regent Alia. Though they were granted a fine upbringing, little attention was bestowed upon them by their aunt, who was possessed by [[Abomination]] and enthralled by her own power and the mysticism developed around the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] name by Paul.

====Evolution on Arrakis ====
[[Image:GodEmperorofDune-LetoWorm.jpg|thumb|left|Leto II as a worm]]
When they were nine years old, Leto and Ghanima gained the attention of their paternal grandmother, [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], who returned to Arrakis from [[Caladan]] to inspect them as part of her obligations to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her [[Fremen]] allies to help protect them.

At this same time, Leto's prescient powers began to emerge. Through visions and intuition, he discovered the [[Golden Path]] that his father had earlier uncovered and begun to follow. However, unlike Paul, Leto developed a greater understanding of the Golden Path's implications. He sensed not only its dangers but also the painful steps that had to be taken to avoid it unraveling, which would be to the peril of humankind.

Leto and Ghanima escaped an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]]. The two split up, with Ghanima conditioned to believe her brother was dead so that if she were to be interrogated on his whereabouts, she would not be able to tell the truth. Leto slipped into almost total anonymity, using the time and relative seclusion to build a foundation of power and knowledge through which the full impact of the Golden Path could be realized. To enact such steps required a strong (almost brutal) grip on power and longevity that would override the shortsightedness and impatience of Man.

Thus, after spending time amongst a variety of fringe [[Fremen]] elements, including [[The Preacher]], Leto accepted [[sand trout]] upon his body and began the conversion into a human-sandworm hybrid. This transformation (which, in the beginning, was essentially a form of [[wikipedia:Exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]), boosted Leto's strength, reflexes, and speed immensely, and he was able to move across large distances on foot.

====Ascendancy to Emperor====
After his transformation had progressed to a sufficient stage, Leto emerged from the desert and returned to the city of [[Arrakeen]] to confront the possessed Alia and claim the throne of the empire.  After Alia managed to briefly overcome her possession and take her own life, Leto claimed the title of Padishah "God" Emperor and promptly married his sister to consolidate his hegemony. The marriage was purely legal. Ghanima accepted [[Farad'n Corrino]] as her mate, but their descendants would be known as Atreides. The same year, Leto began writing his diaries, which would later be known as the [[Stolen Journals]]. 

===Early years as God Emperor {{C|10219-12335}}===
Shortly after his ascendancy, Leto ordered a new ghola of [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]] from the Bene Tleilax to serve him as Commander of the Royal Guard, as the original [[Hayt]] ghola had been killed by the Fremen [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] during the last days of Alia's regency. During the earliest years of his reign, Leto used the existing Fremen forces as well as Farad'n's [[Sardaukar]] troops, which he had given to him upon his ascension to the throne, to enforce his rule. His armies of Fremen and Sardaukar were commanded by a series of Idaho gholas, which would usually be replaced after they tried to kill him and he killed them in response, although very occasionally he allowed them to have natural deaths.

Over the centuries, Leto's empire, which he ruled as the God Emperor, became multigalactic through gradual growth. Very early on in this expansion, Leto suppressed the ancient Order of Mentats and banned the training of Mentats because they formed a nucleus of independent opposition.

====Death of Ghanima====
While Leto lived on for millenia, his sister and wife Ghanima, being but a mortal human woman, died after a relatively normal life in the first years of Leto's rule. After told of her death, Leto, heartbroken, wrote this in his journals:

{{Quote|The sand beach as grey as a dead cheek, a green tideflow reflects cloud ripples; I stand on the dark wet edge. Cold foam cleanses my toes. I smell driftwood smoke.|Leto's journals|God Emperor of Dune}}
He pressed a strand of Ghanima's hair, with a starflower blossom which she once brought to him, between these pages of the journals.

====The [[Fish Speaker|Fish Speakers]]====
While for centuries the Fremen and Sardaukar legions were enough for Leto, he ultimately decided that these forces were unsuitable to his needs. Leto believed that male dominated military forces were essentially predatory and would turn against the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy, whereas a female one would tame and calm. He also needed a reliable religious organization to enforce what was coming to be known as [[Leto's Peace]] to ensure the unfolding of the Golden Path. Because of this, he founded a new all-female army to serve him, commanded by the continuing series of Duncan Idahos.

Leto named the army the "Fish Speakers" because the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams.  Although the Fish Speakers were all female, males were still employed as house guards, and their commander Idaho was male. With the exception of the nomadic Amazons who legend described as once ruling part of the Asian steppes of [[Earth|Old Earth]], the Fish Speakers were just about the only effective all-female army known throughout the history of the universe. They were also, in terms of worlds ruled and historical longevity, the most effective military force ever known.

====Burning of the Nine Historians====
In his 2,116th year as the God Emperor, the famed Nine Historians came to Leto's attention. The historians angered Leto, for they had lied in their works, and he thought they deserved to be punished. On his orders, they were rendered unconscious, then burned on pyres of their own published works. Not one of them felt the flames, and they died peacefully. When Leto was petitioned by other historians seeking word of their fellows, he said:

{{Quote|They were destroyed because they lied pretentiously. Have no fear that my wrath will fall upon you because of your innocent mistakes. I am not overly fond of creating martyrs. Martyrs tend to set dramatic events adrift in human affairs. Drama is one of the targets of my predation. Tremble only if you build false accounts and stand pride-fully upon them. Go now and do not speak of this.|Leto II to the historians|God Emperor of Dune}}
Rumors of this spread across the Empire in the years that followed, through accounts which were later judged by the Bene Gesserit to have originated with Leto himself through his majordomo [[Ikonicre]].<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', page 70</ref>

===Last days {{C|13650-13728}}===
====Suppression of Wallach IX====
In the 3,431st year of Leto's reign, he learned through prescience of the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on Wallach IX. He sent Duncan Idaho to extinguish the School in order to enforce his ban of the Order, but some of the Mentat-Sisters escaped, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood.

====Visit of Sisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko====
Bene Gesserit Sisters Quintinius Violet Chenoeh and Tawsuoko came to Arrakis in the 3,507th year of Leto's reign to confirm the long-suspected execution of the Nine Historians. Sister Chenoeh was invited to accompany the Fish Speakers in an entourage which accompanied one of Leto's infrequent peregrinations. At one point, she was invited to trot behind the Royal Cart and converse with the God Emperor himself. He told Chenoeh to tell the Sisterhood that he would "resore the outward view" and that the Bene Gesserit of all people should know the dangers of breeding for a particular characteristic, of seeking a defined genetic goal. Leto also told her things which she did not include in her report to the Sisterhood - thoughts on how he would be remembered, but also the statement that he would never see her again because she would not live to become a Reverend Mother. His predictions came true, as Chenoeh died in the Spice Agony due to melange incombatiblity.

====Events leading up to the assassination====
=====Final failed assassination attempt by Duncan Idaho=====
A year after Chenoeh's death, the latest Duncan Idaho ghola made the last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life by a Duncan after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him. After tracing the lasgun back to the Ixian Ambassador, Iyo Kobat, Leto ordered Kobat to leave Arrakis, deciding not to kill him because he was too unimportant. Instead, he told him to carry a message to Ix that the God Emperor knew about the agreement between Ix and the Spacing Guild. Leto also gave Kobat a private message for his masters that he wanted an extension for his cart, and that they were to send him a large supply of ridulian crystal paper.

Soon after, Leto sensed the need for the next step on the Golden Path and knew that his rule must end for further progress to occur. Thus Leto used [[Siona Atreides]], a distant descendant of Ghanima and Farad'n, and yet another replacement Duncan Idaho ghola created by the scheming Tleilaxu after the failed assassination. With them, he sowed the seed of the Atreides genes for future generations. 

=====Assassination attempt by the Bene Tleilax=====
During this period, the Bene Tleilax attempted to kill Leto during his progression in the Royal Cart across the Idaho River with his majordomo Moneo Atreides, the newest Duncan Idaho ghola and an entourage of Fish Speakers. Face Dancers approached the group disguised as Museum Fremen (the remnants of the old Fremen of the desert days) before all transforming into a copy of Duncan, each having also obtained uniforms identical to those worn by Idaho. Their hope was to confuse the Fish Speakers into not knowing which Duncan to obey and to kill the God Emperor in the confusion. This failed, however, when Duncan took off his uniform, and so the Fish Speakers knew to obey the commands of the naked Duncan as they fought the Face Dancers. After this incident, he had the Tleilaxu Ambassador publically flogged and expelled.

=====Assassination attempt by the Bene Gesserit=====
Also in the months leading up to the God Emperor's death, two Reverend Mothers and Truthsayers, Tertius Eileen Anteac (who was also one of the Mentats trained on Wallach IX) and Marcus Claire Luyseyal, came to Arrakis. They were warned about the upcoming assassination attempt by the Tleilaxu by Othwi Yake, the assistant to former Ixian ambassador Iyo Kobat, the man who had supplied the weapon Leto's most recent Duncan Idaho had used to try and kill the God Emperor, but their message to him arrived only after the assassination had already failed, because the captain of the Fish Speaker guard would not believe them. Anteac and Luyseyal were granted an audience with Leto, however, at the end of which he agreed to continue the spice allotment of the Sisterhood at its current level for the next decade despite a further attempt at assassination using spice essence by the Sisters.

=====Hwi Noree and death of Malky=====
Leto fell in love with the new Ixian Ambassador [[Hwi Noree]]. Hwi was a direct female clone of Leto's former friend and advisor [[Malky]] created by the Tleilaxu in an Ixian [[no-chamber]]. Since Hwi was conceived and raised outside of his [[prescience|prescient]] abilities, Leto was unaware of her until she was presented to him as an ambassador. Leto was instantly smitten with Noree, and within a few months proposed marriage to her, and set the date of betrothal. After the announcement that Leto and Hwi were to wed, Hwi's uncle Malky was recalled to Arrakis by Leto, and murdered by Moneo after a last personal discussion with his old friend.

====The assassination====
A few weeks later, Leto, Hwi, and Moneo lost their lives when Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by her assistant, [[Nayla]]. They all fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]]. 

{{Quote|Do not fear the Ixians. They can make the machines, but they no longer can make arafel. I know. I was there.|Leto's last words|God Emperor of Dune}}
In dying, he released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise. 

===Legacy===
{{Quote|I will die four deaths - the death of the flesh, the death of the soul, the death of the myth, and the death of reason. And all of these deaths contain the seeds of resurrection.|Leto cryptically explains his death and legacy|God Emperor of Dune}}
During and after his reign, Leto II was viewed as an extremely controversial figure. Following Leto's death, a chain of dramatic events took place over a span of 1,500 years. This included the [[Famine Times]], [[the Scattering]], and the recreation of the [[sandworm]]s on [[Arrakis]], which emerged from the [[sandtrout]] that escaped from Leto's body when he fell into the water. Many of the established power brokers who existed at the start of his rule were either destroyed or significantly weakened, due to his draconian tactics and a monopoly on the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. To his admirers, Leto II was known as the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], but to his enemies (including the [[Bene Gesserit]]) he was labeled [[the Tyrant]] of the [[known universe]]. He was worshipped by the Bene Tleilax as the Prophet of God after his death. 

The religion of the God Emperor also continued on Dune, which became known as Rakis. He was worshipped by the priests of the new Church of the Divided God, which became the dominant force on Rakis and had essential control of the planet, as the great Divided God and the third member of the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven, the other being his grandmother Jessica, and his father, Muad'Dib. It was also believed by the Priests of Rakis that he had carried within him the spirit of his brother, Leto II the Elder. This worship continued until the [[Battle of Rakis|attack on the planet]] by the [[Honored Matres]] and also with those returned to the Old Empire from the Scattering, who called Leto II Dur or [[Guldur]].

====Living on in the sandworms====
It was also said that within each sandworm that grew on Arrakis after his death, a pearl of his consciousness existed. This theory was supported when,  1,500 years after his death, an Arrakeen girl named [[Sheeana]], who was a direct descendant of Siona and Duncan Idaho who later became the youngest ever Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, displayed the power to control the worms.

==Name==
===Etymology===
'''Leto Atreides II''' was named after his paternal grandfather, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]], and his deceased brother [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]]. Due to his brother [[Stiros]] of the [[Church of the Divided God]] called him '''Leto III''' rather than '''Leto II''', but was argued with by [[Hedley Tuek]], who told him that the spirit of the older Leto had been reborn in the younger.

Those who worshipped him on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] called him the '''Great God Dur''', meaning "Great God of Darkness", or '''Guldur''', signifying black magic. 

===Titles===
During his reign and later Leto was commonly known by his title of '''God Emperor''', but after his death he was more commonly called the '''Tyrant''', predominantely by the [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]], who also referred to him as the '''Worm''', '''Worm God''', or '''Old Worm'''. The Bene Tleilax, on the other hand, privately called him the '''Prophet''' or '''Prophet of God''' due to their belief that he was a prophet of their god. 

==Trivia==
*It is possible that the design of the God-Emperor of Mankind, a major character from the ''Warhammer 40,000'' tabletop game franchise, was influenced by Leto Atreides II. The two share strong psychic abilities, are practically immortal, bear the title of "God Emperor", rule over a political body known as "The Imperium", guide mankind towards survival, rule with an iron fist, and are the center of a vast imperial cult. In addition, large sections of the background material of ''Warhammer 40,000 ''in general are seemingly influenced by the ''Dune ''novels.
*In the books, Paul anticipated the birth of Ghanima, but not Leto's. In the 2003 Children of Dune miniseries, this was reversed; he saw visions of a teenaged Leto but not Ghanima.

'''Mitha''' (d. [[10156 AG]]) was a [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] woman of [[Sietch Tabr]]. [[Pardot Kynes/DE|Pardot Kynes]] married her. 

The [[House Harkonnen/DE|Harkonnens]] who hosted him ridiculed his choice behind his back but did not dare to mock him openly, since he was an imperial servant.

She gave birth to their son, [[Liet Kynes/DE|Liet]] and died shortly after his birth in [[10156 AG]].

Kynes allowed the child to be brought up among the other children of [[Sietch Tabr/DE|Sietch Tabr]]. Liet along with his peers, divided his time between in-sietch education and work at the various plantings.

==Notes==

The [[Dune: House Atreides]] prequel by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] names the same Character as [[Frieth]] and identifies her as sister of [[Stilgar]].

On [[Dune (novel)]] the name Mitha is used for a woman from [[Alia Atreides]] [[Other Memory]].It is said she lived "before the [[Parting]]" which presumably makes her an ancestor of the [[Zensunni]].

'''Paul Orestes Atreides''' ([[10175 AG/XD|10175 AG]] - [[10219 AG|10217 AG]])''',''' predominantely known as '''Muad'Dib''', was the first [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], the last [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] from [[10191 AG]] until [[10193 AG]], the first and founding [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] of the [[Atreides Empire]] from [[10193 AG]] until [[10207 AG/XD|10207 AG]], and the supreme religious leader of the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] as the accepted [[Mahdi]] from [[10193 AG]] onwards. The only son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides]] <small>(née [[Nerus family|Nerus]])</small>, Paul's early years were overshadowed by correct suspicions of him as the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], achieved one generation early due to the disobedience of his mother in producing a son rather than a daughter. When he was only a few hours old, Paul was nearly killed by [[Mentat]] [[Piter de Vries/XD|Piter de Vries]], but was saved by Gaius Helen Mohiam, who, although bitter at her disobedience, returned him to his mother. 

When the Atreides were forced by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] into moving from their ancestral homeworld of [[Caladan]] to the desert planet of [[Arrakis]] when Paul was fifteen, he was tested with a [[Gom Jabbar|gom jabbar]] by Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], his success in this test proving him human in the eyes of the Sisterhood. On Arrakis, Paul experienced a supposed attempted assassination attempt using a hunter-seeker, although this was in reality staged by the Harkonnens, the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|historic enemies]] of the Atreides, in order to turn attention away from the traitor planted in the Atreides household, [[Suk Doctor|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]].

Following the [[Siege of Arrakeen]] which killed his father and decimated the Atreides, Paul and his mother were taken in by the [[Fremen]] tribe of [[Sietch Tabr]] after escaping the Harkonnens and the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]], where Paul killed for the first time in a duel with the Fremen [[Jamis]]. After this fight, Paul took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] among the Fremen and found himself becoming a leader among them, and became a good friend to Tabr [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] and the lover of his niece [[Chani Kynes]].

Fuelled by the historic prophecies of the [[Lisan al Gaib|Lisan al-Gaib]] planted by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] centuries ago, Paul found himself inching closer and closer to great power. The years he spent on Arrakis, also saw his mother Jessica drinking the [[Water of Life]], an act which allowed her to become a Reverend Mother and one which Paul later went through with himself, and the birth of his [[Pre-born|preborn]] sister, [[Alia Atreides]]. Paul also trained the Fremen in the weirding way of the Bene Gesserit to make them into the guerilla warriors known as the [[Fedaykin]], allowing them to deal serious blows against the Harkonnens and turn the tide in the ongoing [[Desert War]] against them. When the Emperor decided to come to Arrakis himself to crush Muad'Dib and get spice production back on track, Paul launched the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in his use of [[Great Convention|forbidden]] [[atomics]] in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], a battle which also saw the death of [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|his first son]].

Finally meeting the Emperor personally, Paul revealed to Shaddam that he would destroy all of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet in a chain reaction if he did not allow him to take the Imperial throne, leading to chaos across the [[Known Universe]]. After killing his cousin [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] in a kanly duel, the Emperor and the [[Spacing Guild]] submitted to Paul's will and he was Emperor within three years. Despite his love and loyalty to his concubine Chani, Paul married [[Princess Royal|Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino]] in his quest for the Emperor's seat in the [[Landsraad]], but found navigating this relationship complex and difficult at times.

After ruling his new [[Atreides Empire]] for twelve years, during which the galaxy was at war in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a jihad]] which the [[Fedaykin]] spread across the universe, Paul was blinded by a [[stone burner]] in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a final conspiracy]] against the Atreides throne, but managed to see through his [[Prescience|prescient]] abilites. This presceience-sight ended after the birth of his twin children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], coinciding with Chani's death, and he walked into the desert according to Fremen Law, his sister Alia becoming [[Regent]] of the empire. In the ensuing times he became known as the Preacher, an identity he held for nine years before he was murdered while preaching his 'heresy', shortly after accepting the [[Golden Path]] planned by his son Leto II, who inherited the Imperium as [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] not long after his death and the suicide of his [[Ego-memory|possessed]] sister Alia.

== Biography ==

=== Family lineage ===
[[File:Dune 2020 House Atreides.jpg|thumb|The Atreides were an ancient Great House dating back to the time of Agamemnon on Old Earth.]]
[[House Atreides]] was an old and wealthy [[Houses Major|House Major]] in the [[Landsraad]], tracing their lineage back thousands of years to [[King Agamemnon]], a son of [[Atreus]] in [[Greece]] on [[Earth|Old Earth]]. The Atreides had a long-standing [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] with [[House Harkonnen]] dating back ten thousand years to the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The family kept their ancestral world of [[Caladan]] a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to the Harkonnen capital of [[Giedi Prime]]. However, the Atreides were also proficient in war; they maintained [[Swordmaster|Swordmasters]], [[Warmaster|Warmasters]] and [[Mentat|Mentats]] to train and lead their army, and had even developed their own [[Battle Language]].

The [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] brought Paul's parents, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica Nerus]], who was secretly the natural daughter of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], together in [[10174 AG]], with the intention of producing an Atreides daughter who could then mate with [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]] the Sisterhood had long prepared for. However, the Bene Gesserit plans were thrown into disarray when Jessica, due to her deep love of the Duke Leto, bore a male heir, Paul, to his House rather than a girl.

=== Birth {{C|10175}} ===
{{Quote|When the original [[Jessica Atreides/XD | Jessica]] gave birth to the original Paul, it was a time of political intrigues, assassinations, and conspiracies that resulted in the death of [[Lady]] [[Anirul Corrino/XD | Anirul]], wife of [[Padishah Emperor/XD | Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD | Shaddam IV]], and the near murder of the baby.|The nature of the time of Paul's birth|Hunters of Dune}}<p style="text-align: left;">Jessica kept the gender of her son in secret until she was summoned to the Imperial capital to give birth to her child. Because of the importance of this unborn child, [[Lady]] [[Anirul Corrino]], [[Kwisatz Mother/XD|Kwisatz Mother]] of the the Bene Gesserit and wife of the [[Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]], supervised his birth. Even after the stunning revelation during delivery that the child was a male, Anirul decided that Paul must live and be protected. As Anirul and the Bene Gesserit staff realized that an assassin was in the Imperial Palace, Lady Anirul realized she had to help kill the murderer herself.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">During Jessica's rigorous labor, Anirul found the murderer alone in the Palace but she is mortally wounded, and [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]] was able to kill the murderer. The Imperial intruder turned out to be the [[twisted]] [[mentat]], [[Piter de Vries/XD|Piter de Vries]], agent of [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]]. As word got out about de Vries' killing of Anirul, the capital city, [[Corrinth City]], went into turmoil.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After arriving in Kaitain, Leto quickly searched throughout the Imperial Palace, and once he found Jessica and Paul, they quickly left for [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. A few weeks later, during the announcement of Paul's birth to the citizens of [[Cala City]], far away, on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], giant sandworms performed a mystical rite beneath the light of Dune's second moon.</p>

=== Early life {{C|10175-10191}} ===

==== Upbringing ====
{{Quote|At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.|from [[A Child’s History of Muad‘Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}[[File:Youngpaulatreides.png|thumb|A young Paul Atreides ]]

<p style="text-align: left;">As the son of Duke Leto Atreides I, Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-covered planet of Caladan, the ancestral home of House Atreides. Though he lacked companions his own age, he did recieve tuition from his teachers, men like [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] and [[Wellington Yueh|Doctor Yueh]], as well as education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday in [[10191 AG]], Paul's father revealed to him that Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a [[mentat]]. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. Paul's latent talents also earned him the attention of the Bene Gesserit, who tested him with the [[Golden Lion Throne|Gom Jabbar]] as they hoped to salvage their breeding program through him.</p>
====War of Assassins of 10,187 ====
<blockquote>''Main article: [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]''</blockquote><p style="text-align: left;">During the last [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG|War of Assassins]] between [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]], the Atreides family became involved when [[Ilesa Ecaz]], the intended bride of Duke Leto, was killed just before marrying him. The entire planet went on lockdown, and while Leto prepared his attack force to meet the Moritani's on their home planet of [[Grumman]], his son Paul, who has left in Idaho's care in [[Castle Caladan/XD|Castle Caladan]], was attacked shortly thereafter in his bedchamber.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Duncan arranged an escape into the night, flying with Paul in an ornithopter to Caladan's sparsely populated [[Eastern Continent]]. While fleeing, Paul and Duncan were ruthlessly hunted throughout all of the continent's dense forest overgrowth. The two eventually made friends with [[Caladan primitive]]s, who helped them escape from the assassins over the course of the following week.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually, Duncan arranged for Paul and himself to gain entry to the abbey of the [[Sisters in Isolation]], home in exile of Paul's grandmother, Lady [[Helena Atreides]]. The two rested and refreshed themselves as Paul met his cold demeanored grandmother for the first time. After the Moritani assassins found them, they bombarded and burned down the entire abbey, killing almost everyone inside, including Paul's grandmother. [[Swain Goire]], the Lady's bodyguard, who accompanied her in exile, gave his life, in a last ditch effort to allow Duncan and Paul to escape. Later, in the deep jungle, the Caladan primitives set traps for the assassins, as they came to understand the kindness of House Atreides, and their just rule over the planet.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As the Atreides and Ecaz families joined forces, they landed on the planet Grumman. [[Hundro Moritani]] led his forces into open battle on the salt plains near the planet's capital city, [[Ritka]].</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Paul learned this way the bloody nature of battle, as he saw the hand-to-hand combat experienced by both sides; and it changed Paul's nature thence-forward. Later, when Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV landed near Ritka to enforce a peace treaty, Paul saw the treachery exhibited by Viscount Moritani as he threatened to blow up the entire city and plain with nuclear devices. No longer would the 12-year old Atreides view the world in naivete', but would be prepared.</p>

====Tessia Struck====

A year later, in [[10188 AG]], Jessica and Paul visited [[Ix/XD|Ix]] so that Paul could spend time as an exchange student in [[Vernii]] City, just as his father had done decades earlier. To Jessica's dismay, while there, the Bene Gesserit [[guilt-caster]] [[Stokia]] and three other Sisters visited [[Tessia]] Vernius. They demanded that Tessia produce more children for the Bene Gesserit breeding program, which Tessia refused. Unbeknownst to Jessica, Stokia used her [[psychic]] powers to put Tessia into a comatose trance, which rendered Tessia helpless. Rhombur was unable to help his poor wife, and Dr. Yueh could do nothing to help her, who began to waste away. The Sisterhood demanded that Tessia be take with them to Wallach IX, where they would nurse her and take care of her. In grief, Rhombur let them take his wife away.

==== Running with Bronso ====
Later that day, Rhombur decided to tell his son, [[Bronso Vernius]], that he was the artificially conceived son of [[Tyros Reffa]]. Bronso, who was 11 years old, reacted bad and encouraged Paul to run away with him off-world. Paul, under the oath to Duke Leto "to protect Bronso", accompanied him.

<p style="text-align: left;">Though his time with the Jongleur performing group was less than a month, Paul was able to remember many of the techniques that the Jongleurs had taught him about mass hypnosis, and he was later able to use them to cement his rule amongst the Fremen, and later as [[Emperor]].</p>
====Death of Earl Rhombur====
A few days later, House Atreides received information that both arrived first to [[Chusuk/XD|Chusuk]], and now could be found on [[Balut]] with a [[Jongleur]] performing group. When Jessica and the rest of the searchers from House Atreides and [[House Vernius]] arrived on Balut, they found both Bronso and Paul well treated by the performing group. The Jongleur group was to give a performance in honor of the Governor of Balut's upcoming marriage in the planet's famed [[Theater of Shards]]. Paul was able to sense that an assassination attempt was planned.

Paul saved the life of the planetary Governor [[Alra Kio]], but when Rhombur pushed Balut's leader out of the way, the intense sound blast hit him, and ravaged his body. All present recoiled in horror as Rhombus died, and Bronso cradled his dying father.

Just before Rhombur died, he whispered his last words to his son, "Is Paul safe?" Deeply hurt that his father did not speak of him or his mother while dying, Bronso cast Jessica and the rest of House Atreides out of his life for the next 12 years. The Atreides returned to Caladan.
===Desert War {{C|10191-10193}}===

==== Move to Arrakis ====
{{Quote|On that first day when Muad‘Dib rode through the streets of [[Arrakeen]] with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: “[[Mahdi]]!” But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the [[Lisan al Gaib | Lisan al-Gaib]], the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a [[Bene Gesserit]] and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.|from [[Manual of Muad’Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
[[File:Ha paul hunterseeker-1.png|thumb|Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in the first months on Arrakis.]]
Paul accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] relocated to the desert world of [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. Before their departure, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor's [[Truthsayer]], tested him with the [[gom jabbar]]. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

After a supposed assassination on Paul using a hunter-seeker, Dr Yueh lowered the defensive house shields and used sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught in the [[Siege of Arrakeen]]. The Atreides army was crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape. This attack marked the beginning of the War. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] were sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needed to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan was foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hated the Baron and wished to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to kill their captors and escape into the desert.

==== With Kynes and Idaho ====
Paul and Jessica initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flde to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they had died from a coriolis storm.

==== Alliance with the Fremen ====
[[File:Ha paul jamis fight1-1.png|thumb|Paul fights Jamis to the death.]]
In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers came into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures exploded into awareness. He saw many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he could make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive. After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] proved their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu training – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepted them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also met a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], whom he had long seen in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarmed a proud Fremen, Jamis, who took offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenged Paul to a fight to the death. Although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphed easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. Stilgar gave Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gave himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.
[[File:Paul Atreides with Maker hooks (Frank Herbert's Dune, 2000, Sci-Fi Channel).jpg|thumb|Paul preparing to first ride a sandworm]]
When they returned to the troop's sietch, they discovered the Fremen Reverend Mother was near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they made Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen were about to do, accepted to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realized she has made a mistake, that she was involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who could see genetic memories, and realized that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, would also go through the process. This had truly unfortunate consequences, because it was a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby would not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.

By [[10193 AG]], two years later, Paul had become something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani became his lover and bore him a son, whom he called Leto. He and his mother trained the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who sought out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experienced victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grew. However, in order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he had to become a [[sandrider]]. Paul attempted it and succeeded, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr sprung a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognised his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and called on him and his men to surrender. Gurney was overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrendered his men, and joined Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, were some Imperial spies who attempted to kill Paul. They were unsuccessful, and they were captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gave secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lived on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul used the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he had become a wormrider many of his followers had expected him to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul broke tradition and in doing so forced Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus took power without killing his friend. They returned to Sietch Tabr. Gurney was shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believed she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul did not know. Gurney was about to kill her when Paul walked in, managed to stop him, and explained that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney was almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgived him and he was bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

Paul's power among the Fremen grew, but he was still frustrated. He was not all he could be: he could not control his journeys into the future, and much of it was still blank to him. So he took a truly risky step and consumed a tiny amount of spice essence, and so attempted to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man had survived this experience, and it seemed that he failed also, because he sank into a coma. Paul neglected to tell anyone what he is doing; many people thought he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believed he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, did all she can to wake him but failed, so out of desperation she called Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realised what a mad thing Paul has done, and used spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time had passed, and he gloried in his new memories and powers — he told his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself was currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He had proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declared that it was now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he came to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levied of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again. By now the Emperor was aware of who Muad'Dib was. In advance of his arrival, he sent a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they managed to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but were driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

==== Battle of Arrakeen  ====
After the Emperor himself had landed, Paul launched the final attack. Using the House Atriedes' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blew a hole in the Shield Wall that protected the capital of Arrakeen from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoided contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". The Fremen attacked under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorted out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar were unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they were in total surprise, and the Emperor was forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loomed in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatened to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they backed off. In the surprise of Muad'Dib's attack, Alia managed to escape, and in the process killed the Baron Harkonnen.

Realizing that Muad'dib was not some mad Fremen religious leader changed the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenged Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Paul agreed even knowing that it is possible he would die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempted treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphed.

=== As Emperor {{C|10193-10207}} ===

==== Coronation ====
[[File:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|Paul replaced Shaddam IV as Emperor of the Known Universe]]
Paul refused to take any more nonsense. He forced the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who controlled space travel. He again threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul is capable of it – and they sent everyone home. The Emperor abdicated and retired to Salusa Secundus. Paul married the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], and assumed control of the Empire. Irulan later wrote extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought. Paul then [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|sent a Fremen jihad across the known universe]].

Upon crowning himself Emperor, Paul enacted a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire. A result of this action was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. There was resistance, and Paul found himself increasingly isolated from his family and friends as he decided that the Jihad to implement his vision of mankind's future must be bloodthirsty and relentless. 

==== Kaitain speech ====
Paul arrived on Kaitain in [[10196 AG/XD|10196 AG]], two years after the ruinous [[Sack of Kaitain]], to address the Landsraad for the first time since assuming the Royal Throne, the Emperor explained that the destruction of Kaitain was the

true ending of the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]]. Many of the nobles fell into line behind [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. Others, such as [[Earl]] [[Memnon Thorvald]], of [[House Thorvald]], had witnessed the sack of Kaitain firsthand, stormed out of the Assembly, to foment a rebellion.</p>

====Assassination attempts====

 Paul was also the target of many assassination attempts. The first was not an actual assassination attempt, as Paul initially believed. This was the [[Great Surrender]] ceremony in [[10198 AG/XD|10198 AG]], at the dedication of his new Palace in [[Arrakeen]]. The plot was orchestrated by a misguided [[Swordmaster]] [[Whitmore Bludd]], who wanted to be able to die a hero saving Paul. The attempt killed his sister-in-law, [[Rugi Corrino]], as she was representing the former Royal House at the galaxy-wide event.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The second attempt later that year was a twisted and convoluted attempt involving the former Count, [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]]; his wife [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]]; and their daughter, the gifted [[Marie Fenring]]. In regards to Fenring, Paul's [[prescience]] constantly failed and provided little insight due to Hasimir's genetic make-up of a failed Kwisatz.</p>

{{Quote|All relationships change, Count Fenring, and as humans we must adapt to them or die.|Paul Atreides in [[10198 AG]]|Paul of Dune}}

As a result, at a banquet in honor of the Fenring's, Marie attempted to attack and stab the Emperor, but instead, was killed by Alia. In grief, Hasimir thrusted the [[Emperor's Blade]] deep into Paul's body, which brought him to the brink of death. Paul remembered that he had the abilities of a full [[Reverend Mother]]. While [[Suk]] doctors stitched the damaged organs of his body back together on the cellular level, he passed the [[Water of Life]] that [[Chani]] gave him to save his life. Paul exiled the Fenring couple permanently to [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]] to live out their days with the deposed Shaddam Corrino IV.

====Rise of Bronso====

<p style="text-align: left;">In a secret meeting, Paul arranged to meet his mother and the now restored realtionship with Bronso on the planet [[Ix]]. Suddenly Paul stepped out of the shadows, to explain to his mother the role of the Jihad.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Just before the meeting, Jessica had to resist the urge to kill her son, as she had been promised the [[Mother Superior]] leadership of the Sisterhood by Mohiam, if she murdered the Emperor. Jessica had hitherto been concerned about Paul being possessed by Abomination, since he had sterilized so many worlds for the [[Jihad]].</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Paul explained to Jessica that he ''had'' to sterilize those worlds, because the people that had looked upon him as some type of Messiah, have to learn the kind of tyranny that false messianic hopes could foster. After seeing his atrocities, mankind never would trust in one human for a type of salvation again. He calmly explained that he planned to sterilize even more worlds, but was secretly evacuating the populace of each world to limit the number of deaths. He also told her about Bronso's secret mission -- to write diatribes and publications about Paul's failings.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Over the next few years, as Bronso published and distributed writings about Paul's faults; the [[Qizarate]], Alia, and the Fremen wanted Bronso captured and punished. Bronso eventually was captured, and put into Paul's secure prison on Dune. Paul secretly dismissed the guards and opened the cell, allowing his friend to escape.</p>

====Final years as Emperor====

<p style="text-align: left;">After the bloody [[wikipedia:jihad|Jihad]] that lasted more than twelve years, and claimed billions of lives, Emperor Paul Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion. The order of the Known Universe was maintained through the replacement of Corrino imperial power, which was supported by Sardaukar military strength; with Atreides imperial power, supported by Fremen military strength.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Paul's interpretation of his prescient visions also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]]. Among the schemes of his enemies were the detonation of a [[stone burner]] near where Paul and his forces stood in [[Arrakeen]], which resulted in his physical blindness. Upon Paul's recovery from this incident, he shocked all by his ability to 'see' despite not having eyes. His perfect prescient abilities allowed him to perceive the world around him.</p>

=====Death of Chani=====

<p style="text-align: left;">Despite being able to 'see' through prescience, doubts began to surface in Paul's mind regarding his interpretation of the future. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out. That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, a plot conceived in the presence of a powerful [[Guild Navigator]]. The [[Bene Tleilax]] gave him a [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], who contained a secret trigger. Concurrently, and part of the plan, Irulan slowly poisoned Chani. As the Princesses' toxins slowly worked their way through Chani's body, the [[Chani Kynes|Emperor's Consort]] died during childbirth. [[Image:Leto, Paul & Chani Scytale's Offer.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Paul contemplates life with a ghola of Chani and his newborn children]] Immediately, the [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]], who had been posing as Chani's hand-maid sprung into action, and caused the Idaho ghola to remember his Tleilaxu mission, to kill [[Muad'Dib]]. As this caused a great mental conflict within Duncan, he remembered his past with [[House Atreides]]. Immediately, Scytale realized the great scope of change that had occurred, a ghola had recovered memories of its former life. Scytale bargained with Paul that the Tleilaxu could bring back a ghola of Chani, complete with her life experiences, for Paul to enjoy in realitive obscurity--if Atreides would abdicate. Instead, Paul killed Scytale.</p>

=====Walk into the Desert=====

<p style="text-align: left;">After the birth of his children, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], Paul became convinced he had lost his prescient abilities; he did not forsee the birth of his son, only his daughter. Therefore, as a no more than a blind Fremen, Paul disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]], as was the Fremen custom for the blind.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This action made a powerful statement: it signified to the Fremen that Paul's interest was for the tribe, and that even he, Usul, Paul who was Muad'Dib, was not above Fremen law.</p>

===As The Preacher {{C|10207-10217}}===
[[Image:Preacher01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Preacher addresses a crowded marketplace in Arrakeen, thundering against Alia's regency]] Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.</p>

==== Death ====
<p style="text-align: left;">The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront Alia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Duncan Idaho. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion.#</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transformation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.</p>

=== Gholas during Kralizec {{C|15246-15264}} ===

==== On the ''Ithaca'' ====
After the long periodf the reign of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], followed by the [[The Scattering|Scattering]], the end of the age and the coming of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]] began. [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] and [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]], with various crew and captives, escaped in the [[No-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]'', from the [[New Sisterhood]] capital of [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]]. They were subsequently pursued by the [[Ones of Many Faces/XD|Outside Enemy]], who tried to ensnare them in their [[Tachyon net/XD|Tachyon net]], but the ''Ithaca'' escaped by folding space.

As the Ithaca began its' journey from one part of the Universe to another, it was revealed that one member aboard the ship, [[Scytale]], a [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]], had cells of  leaders from mankind's history, including Paul and many others, which he kept in a Nullentropy tube. Sheeana and her supporters chose to create a ghola of Paul among others.

==== Paolo ====
Upon the urging of Khrone, the [[Lost Tleilaxu]] [[scribe]] [[Uxtal]], created the ghola of Paul named '''Paolo''' in an [[Axlotl Tank]] in Bandalong. Upon his subsequent reaching the age of being a toddler, the ghola of [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], created nine years earlier, became jealous of Paolo. Harkonnen would complain of Paolo, whom he said reminded him of a constantly mewing cat. It was at this time that Khrone told Harkonnen that Paolo was a very important individual, far more important than Vladimir himself.

As Paolo reached the age of four, Khrone decided that it would be best for Paolo to be raised on the [[Atreides]] home-world of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], where he and Vladimir were subsequently taken. At that time, Harkonnen was formally given the charge of raising the young clone, and mandated that Vladimir eradicate all aspects of any kind of Atreides upbringing.

As the years rolled by, Harkonnen continued with Paolo's training, and was especially nice to Paolo, as he was told that the ghola may indeed be the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, even though Vladimir had never believed in such prophecies. During the latter part of his first decade, Paolo began to have visions that involved [[prescience]] about his future. In his perceptions, he would see recurring foresights of himself, battling another older version of himself. In the vision, he would always be victorious holding a [[knife]].

As the end of the age approached and Paolo approached the age of maturity, Khrone once again appeared and announced that the Thinking Machine rulers wanted Paolo brought to [[Synchrony]]; where they could meet, continue to educate, and test the young ghola. It was revealed to the now 11 year old Paolo, that he was believed to be a super-being, and would help the Machines rule human-kind. Once upon the planet, Erasmus continued Paolo's training, especially in the area of martial arts and fighting abilities.

==== Paul versus Paolo ====
As the events of [[Kralizec]] unfolded, the [[no-ship]] ''[[Ithaca]]'' was captured and brought to Synchrony in [[15264 AG]]. The entire crew was disembarked, and the [[ghola]] of Paul Atreides, who had been raised aboard the ship, was brought to the heart of Synchrony, the [[Cathedral]]. Based upon Erasmus' [["mathematical projections"]], Omnius decided the two Paul's would duel-to-the death in one-on-one combat, as he believed that the victor between the two would be the stronger, and hence the Ultimate super-being. Paul was severely wounded and Paolo, victorious, collected his prize; a quantity of [[Ultraspice]].

After he ingested a massive amount of the enhanced [[melange]], Paolo's [[prescience]] was enhanced exponentially, and he began to see almost all aspects of the universe. With the melange having coursed fully through his veins, Paolo also experienced and saw all actions of humanity into the future, as well as those of the past. Paolo soon realized that he was unable to communicate with those around him, became delirious, and he fell into an irreversible, persistent trance-coma.

Even though the events of Kralizec unfolded just yards away from him; Paul's self-healing, the banishment of Omnius by the [[Oracle of Time]], the death of all [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s activated by Erasmus in response to Khrone's failed attempted coup'; Paolo was completely unaware of them. Slowly over the course of the next few days, Paolo starved and thirsted to death, as he was unable to eat or drink.
== Abilities and skills ==
*'''[[Prescience]]''': As the Kwisatz Haderach long sought out for by the breeding programme of the Bene Gesserit Order, Paul possessed a powerful ability to bridge space and time with prescient ability. From an early age, he experienced visions in his dreams which were reported to the Sisterhood by his mother Jessica and was known to have had visions that were accurate, penetrating, and defied four-dimensional explanation. This was one of the key attributes that made them first suspect him being their long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach achieved early. Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Paul's prescient ability was strengthened by the spice melange he constantly inhaled, and it grew greatest during his alliance with the Fremen people, when he first forsaw the jihad that would be waged across the Known Universe in his name, and began to try and avert it. By the end of his reign, Paul's prescience was so powerful that when he lost his eyesight due to a Tleilaxu stone burner, he could interact with the world around him without aid. This was because he was able to remember all the details of his vision of the future. Essentially, Paul knew where everyone would be and what they would say and do. While this helped him in many situations, it was also ultimately his downfall as he was helpless to prevent his future.
*'''[[Weirding Way]]''': Paul was trained by his mother in the Weirding Way of the Bene Gesserit, allowing him to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. When first encountering Sietch Tabr this saved his life, as he was able to overcome the Fremen who saught to kill him and Jessica for their water by means of the Weirding Way. He later taught the Way to many of the Fremen across Arrakis, making them into skilled and deadly Fedaykin by these means, and this was a key factor in his victory in the Battle of Arrakeen.
*'''[[Voice]]''': At the time the Atreides landed on Arrakis, Paul was also developing the audio-neuro control mechanism of Voice used by the Sisterhood to achieve complete control over a reciever. He demonstrated his emerging talent in this field when, after the decimation of the Atreides and the capture of him and his mother into an ornithopter, he used the Voice to order a Harkonnen agent to remove Jessica's gag so that she could use it even more effectively against him, and thus saving both their lives.
*'''[[Prana-bindu|Prana-bindu control]]''': Paul was taught by the supreme control of nerve and muscles known to the Bene Gesserit as prana-bindu by Jessica, which laid the foundations for his use of the Weirding Way and allowed him to gain a higher control over his body which would come to his advantage at many points in his life.
*'''Swordfighting''': In addition to the Bene Gesserit techniques taught to him by his mother for his survival, Paul became a skilled swordfighter after years of training by his chief Atreides teachers, the renowned Swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, who he nearly bested shortly before the move to Arrakis. This proved to be a vital skill, as he employed it not only to best Jamis after he declared amtal during his early years in Sietch Tabr, but later to kill his cousin, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, another skilled fighter, in a kanly duel at the time of his ascension to Emperor.
*'''[[Mentat]] training''': For the first fifteen years of his life, much of Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a Mentat by order of his father Duke Leto. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as the Duke of the Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a Mentat-Duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. He became a fully fledged "true" Mentat after first escaping the Harkonnens with his mother, and the high level Mentat abilities he gained at that time would help him at many points in his life, including helping handle the data of the battles of his jihad and allowing him to piece together the nature of the conspiracies which were aimed against him more quickly than he could have otherwise.
*'''Endurance''': Paul's unusual endurance, especially for a male, was noted by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam when she tested him with a gom jabbar, a test which he passed through this skill. She noted that he surmounted more agony in the test than any other human of record.
== Relationships==

=== Leto Atreides I ===
{{Quote|How do we approach the study of Muad‘Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?|from [[Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries]] by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}Paul respected his father Leto, the penultimate Atreides Duke, who had hopes for a great future for his son as a Mentat-Duke. When Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in a supposed assassination attempt, Leto grew enraged at his Mentat Thufir, who had failed to detect the trap, and was angry that the Harkonnens had tried to take the life of his son. Paul was greatly disturbed when he heard Reverend Mother Mohiam tell his mother: "for the father, nothing", and had an urge to tell Leto what she had said, although he never did. Leto felt like Paul was one of the only people to whom he could reveal his weaknesses and fears as well as entrust the fact that he had never distrusted Jessica, a fact which he told Paul to reveal to her if he never could, and which he did after Leto's death.

=== Chani Kynes ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Paul|You're the strong one, Chani. Stay with me.|Chani|Always.|Paul and Chani's love|Dune (novel)}}Paul first encountered Chani Kynes, daughter of the great Planetologist Liet-Kynes, during him and Jessica's initial encounter and fight with the Fremen, but by that point he had dreamed of her many times. Stilgar told her to keep Paul out of trouble and Chani helped Paul in his fight with Jamis by warning him that Jamis fought with either hand, and that he should keep his mind on the knife and not on the hand that held it. From that point they grew closer, calling each other Usul and Sihaya, and she ultimately became his concubine, and the mother of his first son, Leto Atreides II the Elder, who was killed by Sardaukar in the Battle of Arrakeen. After Paul's ascension to Emperor Chani was considered his true wife rather than his titular wife, the Princess Irulan, and became the mother of two further children with Paul, Ghanima and Leto II, before her death. The love between them was shown by her last word: Usul.

=== Duncan Idaho ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Paul had a close bond with his Swordmaster teacher Duncan Idaho, who trained him from his earliest years, and he was greatly distraught when Idaho fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, he found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Hasimir Fenring ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Shaddam IV|Kill this upstart for me. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now ... you know the way of it. Kill him. Do it!|Hasimir Fenring|Majesty, I must refuse.|Count Fenring refuses to kill Paul|Dune (novel)}}Paul first met Count Hasimir Fenring in 10193 AG during his final confrontation with Emperor Shaddam IV, the Count's closest friend, following the Battle of Arrakeen. Upon seeing the Count Paul felt extreme shock, as he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures—but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions. When the Emperor ordered Fenring to kill Paul, he realised that this was because the Count was a failed Kwisatz Haderach, and looking into Fenring's eyes he felt a deep compassion for the Count flow through him, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced. Seeing this, Fenring refused to kill him, accompaning the Emperor into exile on Salusa Secundus afterwards.

The true bond that existed between Paul and Fenring was shown once again when in 10198 AG the Count attempted to assassinate him after coming to Arrakis obstensibly simply to have his wife's daughter Marie grow up their rather than on Tleilax. Paul did not expect this to be the truth but he invited Fenring to have a drink anyway, and after the first initial supposed attempt through Marie, her death, and the direct true attempt by Fenring, Paul refused to have him killed and instead re-exiled him to Salusa with the Emperor. The respect held by the Count for Paul was also shown by the lapse between him being given the Emperor's Blade by Shaddam in 10194 AG and being compelled by the former Emperor to assassinate Paul and the actual attempt, and the reluctance when it finally came, followed by not very much disappointment on Fenring's part when he failed.

=== Gaius Helen Mohiam ===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Paul Atreides|Try your tricks on me, old witch. Where’s your [[gom jabbar]]? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You’ll find me there staring out at you! Have you nothing to say?|Gaius Helen Mohiam|I welcomed you to the ranks of [[human]]s. Don’t besmirch that.|Observe her, comrades! This is a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]], patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach | one person]] their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand... but... I ... will ... never... do ... her... bidding!”|[[Jessica Atreides | Jessica]]! Silence him!|Paul defies Reverend Mother Mohiam|Dune (novel)}}First meeting the aged Reverend Mother Mohiam when she visited Caladan to test him with a gom jabbar, Paul took instant dislike to the 'old crone', complaining about how she addressed his mother and how she treated him. When Mohiam ordered him to sit as her mother did, he told her that he was not his mother and he preferred to stand, from which she ordained that he hated her a little. Despite being judged human by Mohiam in the test, these feelings continued. He encountered Mohiam again during his final confrontation with the Emperor, terrifying her with his final ultimatum of destroying all melange after pointing out her reliance on spice as a Reverend Mother. She recognised that Paul was indeed the Kwisatz Haderach as she had long suspected. Paul declared that he was indeed the One but he would never to her bidding, and that for her role with the Emperor he could gladly have her strangled, but he thought it better punishment that she should live out her years never able to bend him to the Bene Gesserit schemes. He retained this opinion to the last, telling Alia not to execute Mohiam for her role in the conspiracy against him shortly before his walk into the desert, although she disobeyed him.

== Name ==
{{Quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.|[[Stilgar]] |Dune (novel)}}

=== Etymology ===
Paul's full name being '''Paul Orestes Atreides''', he was named after both his grandfather, [[Duke]] [[Paulus Atreides]], and [[Orestes]] in the [[Greece|Greek]] mythology of [[Earth/XD|Old Earth]]. His surname, that of his family of [[House Atreides]], meant "son of Atreus" in Greek, due to the Atreides' descent from [[Agamemnon]], Orestes' father and the son of [[Atreus]].

The name '''Muad'Dib''', given by Stilgar after Paul bested Jamis in amtal, was taken from the Fremen name for the kangeroo mouse of the Arrakis desert. While he originally called himself '''Paul-Muad'Dib''' after accepting this name, as to not completely remove the name given by his father, this did not become a common name and by his time as Emperor he was generally called only Muad'Dib. While this was the open way to refer to Paul, it was also decided after Jamis' death that the private name used within the sietch would be '''Usul''', meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar" in the Fremen language. He was also called '''Abu Dhur''' or '''Abu d' Dhur'''.

=== Titles ===
In addition to being the '''Kwisatz Haderach''' long sought for by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, Paul was known as both the '''Lisan al-Gaib''' and the '''Mahdi''' to the Fremen. The vanquished of his jihad called him '''the Tyrant''', a title which would later be used more widely to describe his son, the God Emperor, after his assassination. In his nine years as a nameless blind Fremen after walking into the desert, Paul was known by the title of '''the Preacher''' in absence of any name that could be given to him. He was given the postthumous title of the '''Mentat Emperor''' by the Mahdi Spirit Cult. He was given the title of '''Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time''' while being called Abu Dhur by Stilgar and later his son Leto II, who also called him the '''Fil-Haquiqa''' and '''The Reality'''. 

=== In earlier stages ===
In the original ''[[Spice Planet (story)|Spice Planet]]'' which evolved into ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Paul was called '''Barri Linkam'''. 

==Behind the Scenes==

<p style="text-align: left;">In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, McLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]]. The actor, who has a Scottish accent, reportedly adapted an American accent in a relatively short span of time just to land the role. In the 2000 miniseries, Paul was initially portrayed as a sort of "spoiled brat" in order to show the audience his growth from Atreides heir to Emperor of the Known universe.</p>

Enno
{{expanded}}

[[File:Fremen (1984 Dune film).jpg|thumb|Fremen in military training]]

'''Enno''' (d. [[10196 AG/XD|10196 AG]]) was a [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] soldier of [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Muad'dib's Jihad]] who volunteered to be a part of Paul [[Muad'Dib]]'s Army immediately after ascended the [[Golden Lion Throne]].

==As a Fremen Soldier==
Enno was trained by [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] on [[Arrakis]] to learn to swim as the old musician warrior knew that the Jihad would take the soldiers to water-oriented worlds. Halleck placed a [[Corrino]] [[solari]] at the bottom of a giant water tank, and declared that whomever retrieved the coin would win a prize. Enno strived to be the most faithful of Paul Atreides' soldier fanatics, and brought up the metallic object from the water, though he was deathly afraid of the liquid. Unfamiliar with swimming, he almost drowned in the process, and had to be revived by medics.

Later, as Gurney led the Fremen against the forces of [[Lord]] [[Colus]] on the planet [[Galicia]], Enno encouraged the Fremen to not only attack whatever soldiers Colus could muster, but to also cause extensive civilian damage. Enno and the Jihadists burned down villages, with families inside, as he believed it to be the will of the [[Emperor]]. Even after Colus surrendered to Halleck, and Gurney agreed to spare his life, Enno secretly beheaded the man, and placed his head on a spike. Much to the dismay of the Fremen troops that Halleck led, Gurney called for Enno to be brought forth, and personally slit his throat; and placed Enno's head on the spike outside Colus' former villa.

{{Quote|Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldeir. Atreides field-hand on the field of battle.|[[Bijaz]] describing ther original Duncan to [[Hayt]]|Dune Messiah}}

====Early life on Giedi Prime====

[[File:Duncanidahoyoung.png|thumb|a young Duncan Idaho, by Dev Pramanik and Alex Guimarães, House Atreides Graphic novel ]]

Idaho was born on [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] in [[10146 AG]]. His parents were minor government office workers<ref name=":5">[[Dune: House Atreides]]</ref> descended from [[Anari Idaho]], who had been the ancient leader of the great [[Butlerian movement]] ten thousand years ago<ref>[[Navigators of Dune]]</ref>, but at an early age he and his family felt the wrath of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]]: his family, parents, uncle and two cousins were captured in an afternoon in [[Harko]] City, and his sister was killed. Idaho was named '''Number 11368''', and trained to be hunted for sport.

One time, Idaho managed to escape his captors. He entered a [[sunspensor tube]] where the guards could not use [[lasgun]]s. When he saw a [[bullet-train]] approaching, he managed to fall in a hatch. There he was trapped, however the guards who found him later, told him that he "made it".

Duncan's family was visited by [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]] to be congratulated for his ingenuity and be taken for a second round with Rabban, who recently disappointed by a [[sandworm]] hunt on [[Arrakis]]. When he called the boy as "Number 11368", Duncan defiantly mentioned his true name; Rabban shot both his parents with a lasgun and his men forced Duncan outside.

The next time he was left outside in the [[Forest Guard Station|open]], armed only with a handlight, a rope and a [[knife]]. Duncan decided to use the knife and remove the tracer implanted on his shoulder. Using it as a bait, it lured one of the hunters in a rock opening, and then Duncan crushed him by pushing a boulder above him. Then, after cutting his throat he took a [[medpak]] and his lasgun.

With the medpak he managed to fix his shoulder wound, and then had some practice with the lasgun. He managed to drive away a [[gaze hound]] that attacked him. Using the handlight in the snow, he lured his trackers and shot some of them in a lasgun fray. With its charge running low, Duncan started to run towards a blinking light, which turned out to be a [[flitter]]. He entered it, only to be caught by [[Janess Milam]], the woman who gave his family to the Harkonnens.

====Atreides Service====

=====In the Service of Duke Paulus=====
Having to repent, she planned to send Duncan to the Atreides; she arranged with [[Renno]] the Second mate of a cargo craft that Idaho could board the ship and escape the planet. He found his way to [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] and he was determined to find [[Duke]] Atreides.

He started to work as a farm worker in the rice paddies and then as a net-rigger on a fishing boat from the [[Southern Continent]]. As they reached a port on the [[Western Continent]]. He began hitching rides on groundtrucks and cars, and sneaked aboard tube trains and cargo ornithopters until he drove close to [[Castle Caladan]]. In conversations with other travelers, he was shocked to realize that the people there loved and respected their ruler instead of fearing him, much unlike the situation on Giedi Prime.

Eventually (after denied entrance and spending a night in the courtyard), he was allowed audition to the Duke. He narrated his full story and pledged his loyalty to the service of House Atreides.

Initially he worked in the stables under Stablemaster [[Yresk]]. After exposing the successful assassination plot of Lady [[Helena Atreides]] against the beloved Duke [[Paulus Atreides]].<ref name=":5" /> 
=====Training and Loyalty=====
Duncan came under the service of the Atreides after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens.<ref name=":0" /> In 10166, ten years after coming into their service, he began his training on [[Ginaz]] where he graduated as a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] in 10174, coinciding with the Moritani attack on the school in which the students of Grumman fought the others and were ultimately expelled after refusing to condemmn the Viscount Hundro Moritani's actions. Duncan tried to convince his friend Hiih Resser to come and serve the Atreides, but Resser unfortunately joined Moritani as his personal Swordmaster.<ref>[[Dune: House Harkonnen]]</ref>

The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as the Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgment was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul (and possibly the Duke's armies) in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]], a man who was also been rescued from Giedi Prime by the Old Duke Paulus. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education.<ref name=":0" />

=====War of Assassins of 10,187=====
<blockquote>''Main article: [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]''</blockquote>During the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG|final War of Assassins]] between [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]], the Atreides family became involved as collateral damage when [[Ilesa Ecaz]], the intended bride of Duke Leto, was killed just before marrying him. The entire planet went on lockdown, and Paul was left to Idaho's care in [[Castle Caladan]]. After Duke Leto left with an attack force to meet the Moritani's on their home planet of [[Grumman]], Paul was attacked shortly thereafter in his bedchamber.

He and Duncan had to flee into the night, where they arranged through ornithopter flight to escape and travel to Caladan's sparsely populated [[Eastern Continent]]. While fleeing, Paul and Duncan were ruthlessly hunted throughout all of the continent's dense forest overgrowth. The two eventually made friends with the [[Caladan primitive]]s, who helped them escape from the assassins over the course of the following week.

{{Quote|I have no room for compassion toward people who are trying to slaughter us, Paul. I kill them so ''you'' don't have to.|Duncan to [[Paul Atreides]]|Paul of Dune}} 
After two more nights in the jungle, Duncan arranged for he and Paul to gain entry to the abbey of the [[Sisters in Isolation]], home in exile of Paul's grandmother, [[Lady]] [[Helena Atreides]]. The two rested and refreshed themselves, as Idaho re-met the cold-hearted woman who had killed Idaho's beloved Duke Paulus. After the Moritani assassins found Idaho and Atreides they bombarded and burned down the entire abbey, killing almost everyone inside, including Paul's grandmother. [[Swain Goire]], the Lady's bodyguard, was present, as he had joined Helena years later as his punishment for his crime against [[Victor Atreides]], Leto's first son. He fought the Moritani assassins single-handedly, and gave his life, in a last ditch effort to allow Duncan and Paul to escape. Later, in the deep jungle, the Caladan primitives set traps for the assassins, and killed the Moritani murderers, as they came to understand the kindness of the Atreides' family, and their just rule over the planet.
======Attack on Grumman ======
When the time arrived for House Atreides to converge with House Ecaz at [[Grumman]]; Duncan, of course, went along. As House Atreides attacked the Grumman forces, with Ecazi re-inforcements, it seemed evident that [[Ritka]], capital of Grumman would soon fall to Leto's and Armand's forces. As a way of acting as "the peacemaker", the Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] himself, arrived with [[Sardaukar]] in tow, to end the War, and to enforce the cease-fire.

[[Hundro Moritani]] announced that he had all of the great pawns in the place where he wanted them. Leto, Armand, Shaddam, and even secretly, Rabban was there, fighting for an incognito House Harkonnen. Hundro announced that House Moritani was descended from disgraced [[House Tantor]], whom had blown up [[Salusa Secundus]] almost 10,000 years earlier. He then told the entire delegation that he was going to kill himself, and all nobles and armies present, with the [[atomics]] stockpiled by his House. However, the Viscount's bodyguard, Hiih Resser, a friend of Duncan's from the Ginaz Aacademy, had decided to disobey Hundro, and had never set the charges to the detonators on the nuclear devices.<ref>[[Paul of Dune]]</ref>

=====Move to Arrakis=====
Later, when the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief under the order of the [[Emperor]] in 10191, Idaho became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.
=====Death=====
When the Emperor launched [[Siege of Arrakeen|an attack]] on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho escaped the massacre. He initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes, Lady Jessica and Paul, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar. Duncan was killed by one by by a blow to the head, but not before he dispatched no less than nineteen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly. In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], allowing them to escape in an ornithopter.<ref name=":0" />
===First rebirth {{C|10193-10217}}===
After Paul's ascension to the throne in 10193, Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]]''',''' a clone made by the [[Tlulaxa|Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as '''Hayt''' in this first ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In ensuing the trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a Bene Tleilax plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife Chani, but only if he abdicated his throne.<ref name=":1" />

====After Paul's "Death"====
Immediately after Paul's "death" and disappearance of him "walking into the desert", Idaho became concerned for Paul's sister, Alia, and her assumption of Imperial Regent to Paul's children, Leto and Ghanima. Duncan secretly welcomed the Lady Jessica and her aide, Gurney Halleck, back to Arrakis, as they too expressed concern about Alia's paranoia against foes, real and imagined.

Even as Alia created the super-religious, fanatical [[Mahdinate]], to deify the Atreides family, he found himself increasingly attracted to her. Idaho ignored her suppression of all forms of dissent and her execution of Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso Vernius]] of Ix.<ref>[[The Winds of Dune]]</ref>

====Second death ====
[[Image:8969-5459.gif|thumb|right|Richard Jordan, as Duncan, from the [[Dune (1984 movie)]]]]
Idaho married [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], in 10210. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. In 10219, in order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed Javid, Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[naib]] [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Ducan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.<ref name=":2" />

===Incarnations under Leto II {{C|10217-13725}}===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for 3,508 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times, and as leader of the [[Fish Speakers]]. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience and memories of all his ancestors, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The ego-memories of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.

The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of religious tyranny and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm).

Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes". In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself<ref name=":3" />, and in at least one instance he died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin - in another, he died under a Sardaukar sword, when Leto still used them as his fighting force. In one anomalous occasion, Idaho died in a 'thopter crash.<ref name=":6">[[Heretics of Dune]]</ref> In another even rarer occasion, Duncan had accidentally blew himself up after an attempt on Leto's life which he abandoned when the Emperor convinced him he was doing the wrong, causing him to toss the explosive, in which the materials were unstable, to the side.

After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" since most Duncans only possessed the memories of the original Idaho. If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.<ref name=":3" />

====Suppression of Wallach IX====
In 13650, Duncan was charged by Leto to travel to Wallach IX, where he would extinguish the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on the planet in order to enforce Leto's ban of the ancient Order of Mentats. This brought him great pain, as he, a Mentat, was forced to suppress a school that trained people the way he was trained. During the suppression, he talked to Sister Tersius Helen Anteac, one of the Mentat trainees<ref name=":4" /> who escaped the planet shortly after, renaming herself Tertius Eileen Anteac, under the name of which she would later try and kill the God Emperor. Other Mentat-Sisters escaped as well, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood. This incarnation of Duncan died just ten years after the suppression.

====Penultimate Incarnation under Leto====
In his penultimate incarnation still serving the God Emperor, the one after his life in which he suppressed Wallach IX, Duncan had two children with the Fish Speaker [[Irti]] in [[Sietch Jacurutu|Goygoa]]; one in 13712, and another in 13720. In 13727 he made his last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun supplied to him by the Ixian Ambassador Iyo Kobat. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him.

====Last Incarnation in Leto's Service====
After this last time in which he was killed by the God Emperor, a new Duncan was given to Leto by the Bene Tleilax in 13728. This Duncan fell in love with Siona Atreides, a girl hidden from prescience who rebelled against Leto, and became good friends with Siona's father and Leto's majordomo, Moneo Atreides, despite him easily beating him in combat and thus shaming him later on. Ultimately, Duncan joined a final attempt on Leto's life with Siona and her assistant and co-conspirator Nayla. During the God Emperor's wedding with his love, the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree, Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by Nayla. Leto, Hwi and Moneo fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]], named after Duncan In dying, the God Emperor released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise.

=====After Leto's Death=====
After the assassination, Duncan had nine daughters and a thousand sons with Siona<ref name=":3" /> - these children and these children's children, and so on, were hidden from prescience. The significant descendants of these many children, which were said to have "Siona blood", meaning they were shrouded from the prescient vision, included [[Hadi Benotto]], [[Darwi Odrade]], [[Miles Teg]] and [[Sheeana Brugh]]. Duncan and Siona also inherited a portion of Leto's empire, which rapidly detoriorated into the [[Famine Times]] and the [[Scattering]].

Ultimately, long after the death of this incarnation, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola, born in 15216, survived.

===Final incarnation {{C|15216-15264}}===

====On Gammu====
In 15229, on Gammu (formerly Giedi Prime), Duncan fled to an old Harkonnen no-globe with Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit [[Bashar/XD|Bashar]], and Reverend Mother Lucilla, after an attack on the Bene Gesserit Gammu Keep. Miles Teg was commissioned to restore Duncan's memories, and managed to do so. Duncan, Teg and Lucilla were ambushed during an operation with the general Burzmali. Teg was captured but Duncan managed to escape with Lucilla.

When [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matre]], tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play when he overwhelmed Murbella in combat, and all of the memories of the hundreds of previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released.

Duncan and Lucilla were located by Miles Teg and brough to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella in a no-ship. Duncan, Murbella, Lucilla, Sheeana Brugh, Darwi Odrade and Tleilaxu Master Scytale were put in the no-ship with a sandworm while Teg launched [[Battle of Rakis|a final suicidal defense of Rakis]].<ref name=":6" />

====Imprisoned on Chapterhouse====
After the destruction of Rakis, the no-ship ''Ithaca'' was brough to Chapterhouse in a no-ship, which became their prison, as well as Scytale's, by the Bene Gesserit. Over the next ten years, Murbella and Idaho sired four daughters, [[Janess Idaho]], [[Rinya Idaho]], [[Gianne Idaho]] and [[Tanisia Idaho]].. Idaho was then used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola. By this time, he had been allied with Reverend Mother [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] for some time, who stole the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Over the decade he spent imprisoned within the no-ship, he had continous visions of a pair of mysterious and powerful elderly-looking entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] and something he began to call "the net". He was suspicious of these beings but could never truly work out who they were.

====Escape from Chapterhouse ====
In 15240, after Murbella became both Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit and Great Honoured Matre of the Honoured Matres, and began the combination of the two groups, Duncan escaped with his ward, [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] and others aboard the no-ship ''Ithaca'' into unchartered space to escape from the now-combined Gesserit/Matres group, the [[New Sisterhood]]. Exhibiting [[prescience]] abilities, Idaho was the only person that could see the net that Daniel and Marty cast to ensare the no-ship. To escape this net, Duncan Idaho deleted all of the navigation records of the ''Ithaca'', rendering those onboard truly lost.<ref name=":4" /> 

====Alternate universe and Gholas====
After escaping from the tachyon net of the mysterious pair, and entering another universe in 15243, Duncan Idaho continued to be the captain of the ''Ithaca''. He was especially interested in the training of his friend, the ghola of Miles Teg in the arts of the [[Ginaz Swordmasters]]. After being in the alternate universe for 4 years, Idaho was contacted by the [[Oracle of Time]] - the guide of the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]] - and with her help, was able to make a blind [[foldspace]] jump, this time emerging back in the familiar universe.

It was during this time that Sheeana and the other Bene Gesserit [[sisters]] that she had brought along, decided to create gholas from the [[nullentropy tube]] that [[Scytale]], the [[Tleilaxu Master]], had brought with him. Gholas from Idaho's past; [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]], [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], [[Leto Atreides/XD|Leto II]], [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], Stilgar, [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], and [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Wellington Yueh]], were resurrected in a short period of time over the next few years.

====[[Rikka's Planet]]====
After another ten years had passed, bones of dead Reverend Mothers were found in a previously unexplored room of the no-ship. As the funeral ceremony for the Mothers commenced, Idaho once again saw the threads of the tachyon net once again thrown out by the Enemy. Both Teg and Idaho raced to the bridge of the ''Ithaca'', and as Teg reached first, he was able to activate the Holtzman engines to escape.

The ship came out of fold-space again at a planet that had been heavily colonized by human-kind during [[The Scattering]]. All of the buildings on the planet were covered with ivy, and been over-grown with plant life. Once again, Duncan stayed on the ship as a crew went to investigate further. Sheeana and Garimi, leading the investigation, activated a holo recording of an Honored Matre leader named [[Rikka]], who had contacted a dreaded plague. Rikka explained to those who watched that the plague came from those "with many faces". It was then that Sheeana realized that the planet had been devastated with a plague similar to the [[Omnius Scourge]], and all human-kind on the planet had died. The group immediately went back to the vessel.

====Planet of the Handlers====
Sabotage began aboard the ship, as someone released water into space, which showed where the no-ship was. Duncan feared the return of the elderly couple, called the crew back onto the ship, and encouraged the ghola of Miles Teg to engage the engines, which he did, folding space again. The ship came out of fold-space above the planet of the [[Handler/XD|Handlers]], keepers of the genetically-engineered half-man, half-feline [[Futar]]s. After some of the ''Ithaca'' crew, and [[Hrrm/XD|Hrrm]] and his clan of futars bounded down to the planet, they met the leader of the Handlers, [[Orak Tho]].

He divided the group into two, led them to observation towers, and together they watched a Futar-hunt of five Honored Matres. As Hrrm and his group killed some of the Matres, the last Matres remaining killed a Handler, who reverted to an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]. It soon became apparent to all that most of the Handlers were nothing more than [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s.

The watching crew, having been split into 2 separate groups, raced back to the ''Ithaca'', the first group led by Sheeana made it back quickly. The second, led by Hawat, had to make a death-defying jump onto the ship, as the ship pulled away from the planet's atmosphere. The Handlers tried to ram and board the ship, but were unsuccessful, as the ship folded space and disappeared again.<ref>[[Hunters of Dune]]</ref>

====Later years on the ''Ithaca''====
In his personal life, Duncan strongly wished to be free of the imprinting that Murbella had put upon him decades earlier. Still full of youth from the melange from the ship's storage, Sheeana broke Duncan free from the strong [[imprint]]-bond that Murbella had laid upon him. Idaho reflected upon his life, and the previous lives he had led, and realized that he truly felt sorry for all types of people, as he had accumulated lifetimes of memories to build up compassion for human-kind.

Over the next few years, the ''Ithaca'' was very careful in their travels, but the incidents of sabotage increased aboard the ship. Even though a ghola of [[Alia Atreides]] was birthed, someone killed the gholas of [[Xavier Harkonnen]], [[Serena Butler]], and [[Gurney Halleck]], that Sheeana had decided to raise in their war, if needed, against the Enemy. Yueh, being tricked by the Jewish Rabbi, purposely killed a ghola of Leto I, being raised in the ships [[Axlotl Tanks]]. Tensions increased as air recycling systems and food storage units were ruined and destroyed on the vessel by the unknown saboteur(s). This increased Duncan's feelings of helplessness and loneliness, as the ship, what he now felt was his ship, forced into another random jump, to find a way to replenish supplies.

====Qelso====
Idaho was surprised, as were all aboard, as the ''Ithaca'' came out of fold-space above the fruitful, but dying planet of Qelso, and he began to wonder if he had prescience in the choosing of fold-space timing and direction. Qelso was a seed world that [[Mother Superior]] Odrade had sent sisters to, and had been seeded with sand-trout to begin a [[spice cycle]]. The inhabitants were openly hostile to the Bene Gesserit for this reason, and held hostage some of the crew that went down to the planet.&nbsp; Duncan, who stayed invisible to the Enemy as long as he was on the ship, decided to lead a rescue team of the group.

The group, which consisted of Sheeana, Teg, and notable others was released; but Stilgar and Kynes stayed behind to help the bitter natives adapt to the encroaching desert and the ever increasing number of sandworms on the world. Idaho had made himself vulnerable to the watchful eyes of Daniel and Marty, and the ''Ithaca'' had to fold space again to safety.

==== Final Sabotage and Capture====
Later, when Leto II went to commune with the sandworms that were in the hold of the ship, Hawat went to guard him should the giant beasts turn on the young man. The worms reared up when Hawat entered the hold, and immediately killed Hawat, and showed him to be an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]. This led to a ship wide search for other saboteurs that might be involved in subversion. To question everyone aboard at the same time, all of the inhabitants of the ''Ithaca'' were called to the main assembly hall.

Scytale used the old Tleilaxu [[Whistling language]], which caused all [[Face Dancer]]s muscles and visages to momentarily become jumbled. It was revealed that the Rabbi was indeed an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]], and the Dancer stole away to the vessel's bridge, and locked himself in. The Dancer immediately began to destroy the ship's navigation, cloaking, and engine systems; and the ship returned to visibility. Idaho remembered back, and realized the Dancers must have boarded years earlier, at the planet of the Handlers.

Immediately the tachyon net reappeared, and Thinking Machine starships began to surround the no-ship. Alia managed to sneak into the cockpit of the ''Ithaca'', killing the Dancer, and opened the area. Idaho and Teg raced into the control room, Teg then went into hyper-movement, and raced around the ship at sonic speed, and repaired all of the ship's systems. As Duncan engaged the Holtzman Engines, a Machine starship rammed the ''Ithaca'', and forced it into submission. Idaho signaled surrender, and the ship was brought to the Machine Capital of [[Synchrony]], as the inhabitants of the no-ship realized that their Enemy were Thinking Machines.

====Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach on the Day of Kralizec====
As the Day of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]] began in the year [[15264 AG]], Omnius thought that Paul Atreides was the final super-being; Paul and his immediate family and friends, sans Duncan, were brought to the heart of the capital, in the [[Cathedral]]. There, Paul and a clone of him, [[Paolo]], dueled to the death; with Paolo rendered into an irreversible [[Ultraspice]] coma, and Paul had to heal himself from Paolo's near-fatal stab wound. As Duncan decided to enter the Cathedral, Paul came back from the brink of death. Both Paul's recently restored power of prescience and the [[Oracle of Time]] revealed that Duncan was the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach!&nbsp; Only Idaho had a multitude of a lifetime of experiences to refine his persona and abilities; not Paul, nor any other Atreides, nor any of their descendants.

The Oracle realized her life mission was to banish Omnius forever, and took Omnius with her to the alternate universe permanently, ending his rule as the [[Evermind]]. As a test of Duncan's powers, Erasmus ordered his killing robots to attack Idaho. Duncan used super-human speed to kill them, easily destroyed the units, and confirmed his future role as the final super-being. Overwhelmed by the unexpected revelations, Duncan decided to take Erasmus' advice to unite humanity and the thinking machines, rather than bring about the absolute destruction of intelligent technology for the second time in history.

Duncan assumed the responsibility of mediator between the two sides; with Erasmus' willing participation, the savant AI being the new Evermind. Erasmus then shared with Duncan all of the codes and sequences of the Machine Empire, and caused Duncan's human super-being to be endowed with all the aspects of the Evermind, as a type of human-machine hybrid. Erasmus then voluntarily "died", while remaining in Other Memory speaking to Duncan. Duncan became the final Kwisatz, and immediately caused a truce to occur between the Machines and Man, who were locked in bitter war over the planets of [[Junction]] and [[Chapterhouse]].

====New Evermind Super-Being====
Duncan then forced peace between man and machine on all inhabitants of the [[Known Universe]]. Idaho had Murbella, the mother of his children, brought to Synchrony, where she could view the events of the truce, which allowed her to rest from her decades-long struggle against the former enemy. Then both Idaho and Murbella traveled back to [[Chapterhouse]], where Duncan met his daughter, Supreme Bashar Janess Idaho. Sheeana was given Synchrony by Duncan, to be a place where she raised up a traditional Bene Gesserit school. Synchrony also became a place of the sandworms, where Leto II had released them during the Kralizec struggle.

Idaho visited the realms of the galaxies where he guided millions of Machine units into helping human-kind; and some machines forged their own civilization on barren, air-less worlds. One such helped place, for example, was Qelso; where Kynes and Stilgar were given hundreds of machines to help divide the world into a place of desert, and the other half a place of greenery that could support all human life. The future of mankind and machine was bright as Idaho guided them both, after several millennia of conflict, into a trustworthy destiny, the [[New Order]] which began to form of both man and machine.<ref name=":4" />

== Abilities and skills ==
''Note:'' As originally the memories of each rebirth of Duncan would pick up with his death on Arraksi, some incarnations had abilities which others did not. All of the following, however, were possessed by his final incarnation, who regained the memories of all of his previous lives.

* '''Swordfighting''': Duncan was trained as a Ginaz Swordmaster, which made him an adept at swordfighting, giving the Atreides a great warrior. Duncan's abilities in this area were demonstrated in multiple instances, perhaps the most notable being his killing of a full nineteen Sardaukar, the finest warriors in the Imperium, in a short time before his first death. This was one of the many motivations of the original taking of his cells by the Emperor's warriors, as well as one of the reasons why the God Emperor appointed him as Commander of his forces and continously brought him back and why the Bene Gesserit continued to resurrect him after Leto II's death.
* '''Resistance to Voice''': In his original lifetime, Duncan was taught by Paul Atreides the techniques used to resist the Bene Gesserit Voice of command, an ability which gave the Sisterhood less power over him, such as when the Reverend Mother Lucilla tried and failed to use Voice on Duncan in his final incarnation on Gammu.
* '''Mentat training''': In his first rebirth as the ghola Hayt, Duncan was trained by the Bene Tleilax as a Mentat in addition to a Zensunni philosopher. The God Emperor later trained him as a Mentat in a few of his later incarnations.
* '''Truthsayer''': Leto II also trained him as a Truthsayer in a few of his lives.

== Relationships ==

=== Paul Atreides ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Duncan had a close bond with his beloved Duke's son Paul, who he taught in swordfighting from his earliest years, and Paul was greatly distraught when he fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis, saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, Paul found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Stilgar ===
{{Quote|Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho. The body of [[Turok | our friend]] remains with [[Leto Atreides I | your Duke]]. His water is [[House Atreides | Atreides]] water. It is a bond between us.|Stilgar shortly after the agreemenet of Duncan's duel alleigance|Dune (novel)}}
When Duncan was sent by the Duke Leto to make contact with the Fremen, the first he befriended was Stilgar, Naib of Sietch Tabr, which was the first sietch which Duncan found. In the relatively short time the two knew each other, they grew great respect for each other, Stilgar aknowledging that Duncan measured well in his sietch and observed the customs and honor among the Fremen people. Because of this, when Stilgar met the Duke Leto they agreed that Duncan would have duel alleigance to the Atreides and the Fremen. 

Eighteen years later, when Duncan's first ghola Hayt was presented to Paul, Stilgar initially mistrusted Hayt, declaring that Duncan was dead and this was not him, but ultimately grew a new friendship with the ghola, which grew even deeper when Hayt's memories were restored. At the last, however, Stilgar and Duncan were enemies once more; after Duncan murdered Javid and gave Stilgar the three greatest Fremen insults, he was forced by his honor to finally kill Idaho, an act which Duncan nevertheless called the right choice and one which forced him to subsequently move against the Regent Alia.

=== Bijaz ===
{{Quote|We are like brothers. We grew in the same [[axlotl tank | tank]]: I first and then you.|Bijaz describes his connection with Duncan while imprisoned in [[Arrakeen]]|Dune Messiah (novel)}}Duncan first met the dwarf Bijaz as Hayt, before he regained his original memories. He took an instant dislike to him, mistrusting the dwarf and being wary in his presence and particularly distraught at Bijaz's provocative use of his original name of Duncan Idaho. However, Hayt and Bijaz also had a fundemental connection in that they had been grown in the same Tleilaxu axolotl tank, making Bijaz compare them to borthers.

During Hayt's conversation with Bijaz after their initial meeting, the ghola noted that he radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observor think of ancient idols and threatened to order a guard to strangle him in an attempt to indimiate the dwarf, who also was not fond of Hayt, calling him a callous lout. When Hayt asked what Bijaz planned to do with him, he said that he would do him a simple kindness. Following the reawakening of Duncan's memories in Hayt, Paul ordered him to kill Bijaz before he succumbed to the Tleilaxu plan, and Duncan obeyed without hesitation, saying that he had been the one to do Bijaz the 'kindness.'

=== Moneo Atreides ===
Over many ghola incarnations in the latter days of the reign of Leto II, the God Emperor's majordomo Moneo Atreides grew a great affection for Duncan, although after each rebirth Duncan experienced meeting Moneo all over again. Duncan's last incarnation under Leto II, the one which assassinated him, was at one point easily bested by Moneo in combat, embarrassing him and creating somewhat bitter feelings between them, although the majordomo later apologised.

=== Schwangyu ===
During the long training of his final incarnation in the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu, Duncan had many Bene Gesserit teachers, but he despised none above the Reverend Mother Schwangyu, who was a member of the faction who opposed Mother Superior Tararza and also became a traitor to the Sisterhood for the Bene Tleilax. He eventually repeated the private mantra, 'Damn Schwangyu!', and showed little if any regret for her murder by Honored Matres when the Keep was attacked.

==Behind the Scenes==
Idaho is the only character to appear in all of the six Original Dune novels, albeit in different incarnations. Despite only having a relatively minor appearance in the first book, the character became the focal point of the saga, and his existence as a series of gholas was to serve an ultimate purpose. Throughout the series, Idaho developed from a relatively minor role to that of one of the main protagonists.

In the 1984 '''Dune''' movie, Duncan Idaho was played by late actor '''Richard Jordan '''and is killed earlier in the story, during the attack on Arrakeen where he tried to save Paul and Jessica inside the palace. He was killed by a hunter-seeker which penetrated the shield and stabbed his head). In the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries he was portrayed by '''James Watson''' who was killed by weapons fire from a Harkonnen thopter, while the first Duncan Idaho ghola was portrayed in the '''Children of Dune''' miniseries by '''Edward Atterton'''.

Sheeana Brugh
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[Image:sheeana.jpg|thumb|Sheeana Brugh and the Sandworms]]
'''Sheeana Brugh''' (b. 15218 AG) was a [[Fremen]] during the time of the return from the [[Scattering]]. She came to the attention of the [[Rakian Priesthood]], the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Bene Tleilax]] because it was discovered that the [[sandworm|worms]] of Rakis obeyed her.

== Early Life ==

[[File:Img167.jpg|thumb|Sheeana - Illustration by Klaus D.Schiemann]]

Sheeana was raised by her parents in a shanty town on the outskirts of [[Arrakeen|Keen]] on [[Arrakis|Rakis]]. When she was eight years of age her town was destroyed by a worm. Sheeana watched from a distance as her parents and fellow villagers were killed. When Sheeana approached the worm that orphaned her, she was not killed by the creature. Instead, she discovered that the worm obeyed her.

Shortly thereafter, Sheanna found herself at the city of Keen. She was led there by a worm after she climbed atop of it. Upon her arrival at Keen the Rakian Priesthood adopted the girl and obeyed her every whim.

== Involvement with the Bene Gesserit ==
[[Image:Sheeana Fremen.jpg|thumb|left|Sheeana, from the Russian cover of ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'']]
Some years later, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood took an interest in her, in order to fulfill a plan orchestrated by the Sisterhood to propagate the worms on their [[Chapterhouse]] planet. The Bene Gesserit eventually made Sheeana a sister, although her Fremen upbringing and an early exposure to [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] sexual practices (courtesy of the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]]) made her an unpredictable element within the Sisterhood.

Bene Gesserit analysis of her DNA revealed that Sheeana was a descendant of [[Siona Atreides]] and [[Duncan Idaho]]. This, according to the Sisterhood's theories, was the reason why the worms obeyed her. It was also how the Sisterhood used her to lure a worm into a [[no-ship]], just before the sterilization of the surface of Rakis by the [[Honored Matres]]. From there it made its way to Chapterhouse where it was to be re-seeded.

== Escape ==
Having grown unhappy with her involvement with the Bene Gesserit, and after striking up a friendship with the Sisterhood's [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]], Sheeana escaped in a [[no-ship]] with Duncan, the imprisoned [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] Master [[Scytale]], Ghola Teg, The Rabbi's Party (including Rebecca), some proctor Bene Gesserits and some [[sandworms]]. Their escape occurred during the turmoil of the Bene Gesserit-[[Honored Matres]] merger, and saw them journey beyond the [[known universe]] into uncharted territory, as the Bene Gesserit splinter group searched for a new home.

'''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG]]-[[10256 AG]]), born as either '''Jessica Nerus''' or '''Jessica Harkonnen''', was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son, Emperor [[Paul Atreides]], and daughter, [[Alia Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

==History==
As a result of the [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] and [[Tanidia Nerus]]. Due to this, prior to becoming Leto's concubine she was probably referred to as Jessica Nerus in Bene Gesserit records, as opposed to Jessica Harkonnen, which was top secret information and her lineage remained a secret according to [[Bene Gesserit]] tradition.

She was raised from birth by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides]] heir [[Leto Atreides I]], to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced [[Bene Gesserit]] education and training.

===With Duke Leto===
====Relationship with Leto Atreides I====
The  [[Bene Gesserit]] plan to couple Jessica with Duke Leto Atreides I initially appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the official concubine of Leto Atreides I, which allowed him to also marry, should such a political union prove advantageous for the Great [[House]].

The relationship between the two quickly evolved into genuine love, and due to this love, Jessica disobeyed her orders and gave birth to a son, Paul Atreides, who would be heir of House Atreides, and ultimately ruined the Bene Gesserit plans.

=== Migration to Arrakis ===
In [[10,191]] AG, when [[House Atreides]] was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]] and their son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]].

When [[House Harkonnen]] seized control of [[Arrakis]], Leto was killed, and Jessica and [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen]]. Her grief over losing [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]], who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with her daughter [[Alia Atreides]].

====Reverend Mother====
The [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own [[Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her. Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged [[Reverend Mother]], Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to [[Reverend Mother]] status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination]] in her daughter Alia.

====After the Death of Paul====
Immediately after the supposed death of Paul, Jessica returned with Gurney to Arrakis, out of concern for her grandchildren, Leto and Ghanima. She was also dismayed about the rising cruelty that her daughter Alia used in consolidating her power for her own gain after Paul's "death". She watched with alarm as Alia created the [[Mahdinate]], a super-religious organization based on the Atreides family. Jessica was also concerned about how Alia banned all forms of opposing expression, and had executed [[Bronso]] of Ix for his writings of the changes that Paul had gone through. She eventually returned to Caladan in deep concern for the Empire.

====Later Years====
Jessica returned to [[Arrakis]], long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

For her protection against her murdering daughter, [[Duncan Idaho]] (the ghola formerly known as Hayt) "kidnapped" Jessica and took her to Salusa Secundus, home of the exiled Corrino House. There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

===Legacy===
In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

==Physical Appearance==
Jessica is a tall, slim woman with bronze-colored hair that she often wore tied with black ribbon at the crown. She had an oval face with eyes as green as the morning skies of Caladan, a small, slightly upturned nose, and a wide, generous mouth. In her later years her hair became flecked with silver.

Zensunni/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Zensunni}}

[[File:C306782831b898192fcecff680c9e755.jpg|thumb|Rogue Zensunni -Fanart]]

'''Zensunni''' was a religious belief system prominent with many cultures spread across the [[Known Universe]], especially those descended from disadvantaged and enslaved peoples. 

== History ==
They were followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of [[Maometh]] about [[1381 BG]]. Most scholars name [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] as leader of the original schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male spokesman for his second wife, [[Nisai]] <ref>[[Terminology of the Imperium]]</ref>.

In accordance with their devotion, the Zensunni believed that they owed no allegiance to any secular
government and the sect found most of its followers in those peoples already disposed to self-government; on [[Terra]] the Zensunni represented a small fraction (in [[1572 AG]] there were less than 50,000) and they preferred nomadic isolated life in places such as the [[Sahara Desert]].

Their [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|migration]] started in [[2800 AG]] when [[Siridar]] [[Baron]] of [[Terra]], [[Charles Mikarrol]], forcefully sent two million Zensunni to [[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]], to comply with [[Elrood V]]'s order who wished to populate the planet.

During their stay on [[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]] Zensunni developed understanding of neural physiology and this understanding led to the [[distrans/DE|distrans]]; Zensunni never relied on [[thinking machines]]. Over several generations, on [[Rossak/DE|Rossak]], under the guidance of their [[Sayyadina/DE|Sayyadina]] they rolled back 16,000 years of language change. On [[Harmonthep/DE|Harmonthep]] they invented the first [[paracompass/DE|paracompass]] and on [[Ishia]] they developed the [[stilltent/DE|stilltent]]. The Zensunni had been used as laborers of many different types.

Zensunni homeworld was considered to be legendary [[Nilotic al-Ourouba]].

Later, the Zensunni predisposition was manipulated by the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]], via their [[Missionaria Protectiva/DE|Missionaria Protectiva]] arm and [[Panoplia Propheticus]] strategy, for their own political objectives. Their last station, [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], was of particular interest in this regard. The exclusivity of the critical [[spice/DE|Spice Melange]] on the planet made the resident [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]], staunch followers of Zensunni, of natural interest to the Bene Gesserit. It is theorized an early contact with the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] which would explain because of the interrelation between the BG and the Fremen Motherhood. 

The emergence of the powerful [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]], and his adoption of Fremen ways, gave Zensunni beliefs a dramatic new popularity. After his ascension to [[Emperor]] Paul embarked on a ferocious jihad that brought great violence and turmoil. The stark contrast of these actions vis-à-vis pacifist Zensunni beliefs was not lost on some of the faithful.

The [[Preacher]] sought to reawaken the relapsed Fremen to their Zensunni heritage

== Core Beliefs ==
Little is known of the evolution of the Zensunni faith. What is beyond doubt is that the Zensunni belief was an amalgamation of two ancient religions: ''[[Sunni]] Islam'' and ''[[Zen]] Buddhism''. The Zensunni religion is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to "the ways  of the fathers." The Zensunni mixed heritage of Zen and Sunni traditions became mingled with other deep-strata convictions during their long [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|quest]]. 

Its underlying purpose was to answer the''[[sunnah]]'' — the ten thousand religious questions posed by the [[Shari-a]] — with mystical understanding, and not with the more usual rational approaches

Their religion was severe in the extreme. It demanded close obedience to an authority figure who must have literally had the power of life and death over his subjects which in Fremen religion materialized on the [[naib/DE|naib]].

As a faith, Zensunni has beliefs such as the existence of [[Auliya]] as God's handmaiden and the ''[[ilm]]'' and ''[[figh]]''

A cult of mystics practiced ''[[siayla]]'' "Light of Truth", held annually among the Zensunni to discuss the progress made toward their religious goals during a year.

Their interest in messianic psychology, for instance, was augmented by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]]'s long-range planning. "Hearthside supersititions" were accumulated in non-desert surroundings. The addictive spice-water ecology entered the Fremen society on Arrakis. So it is not easy to
be certain what parts of their theology (Urn), ritual and behavioral assumptions were as ancient as their Terran origins. 

Zensunni beliefs parallel the cultural patterns of the [[Orange Catholic Bible/DE|OCB]]: a model calls of a Creation for the benefit of Humankind, the Fall of Man, and a tempestuous battle at some predetermined but unspecified End, between Good and Evil.

The Zensunni were monotheists, believing in a god who does not interfere in day-today events but determines the overall pattern of temporal affairs;  merciful and compassionate rather than vengeful. Since the later Fremen prohibited tombs, this indicates that a spiritual rather than bodily afterlife was large in their anticipations, with water at the core of the dreams of paradise (yet [[Leto II/DE|Leto II]]'s satisfactory description of the Paradise to Come implies that physical senses would be rekindled after death). [[Pardot Kynes/DE|Pardot Kynes]]' plans for the terraforming of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]] certainly harmonized with the Fremen's ultimate hopes. On their way to Paradise, the Fremen expected a grand [[Kralizec|devastation]], the Typhoon
Wind at the end.

The ancient model of specific Beginning and Ending, when thrived, was neither peculiar nor consistent and all-inclusive: Each system, separate satellite, and sometimes different communication groups or "sects" of "all-believers" on a single satellite, believed that they were the Chosen; its population alone would survive the climax-battle, and reinforced their community through prejudice against strangers (the "unwashed" or the "infidel") who did not accept their metaphysics and rituals- This tendency to splinter instead of embrace is noteworthy because, a heritage of persecution and enslavement and flight can compress a culture of believers into patient fanatics. Defeat and exile were transformed by the faithful Wanderers into [[hajr]] and eventually into vengeful triumph — [[jihad]] — where the true believers struck back and justified the long-nurtured reciprocity of faith in the Creator and Creator's faith in The People.

Sandworm/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Sandworm}}

[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|a sandworm of Arrakis.]]
This article is about the creature, Sandworm. For information on the novel ''Sandworms of Dune'', by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J Anderson]], see ''[[Sandworms of Dune (novel)|Sandworms of Dune]]''. 
 
The sandworm was a native life-form of the planet [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. It lived in the vast deserts and sand dunes that stretched across the surface of the planet. Simply put, the sandworm was an essential factor in the creation of the [[Spice Melange/XD|melange]]. 

Sandworms lived beneath the sand. Attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations. This was an effort to defend their territory, of which they were highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, was extremely rare, save for the mysterious [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]], who had achieved some kind of mastery over the beast. 

==Characteristics==

The Sandworm was the predominate lifeform on Arrakis, both honored and feared; vital and deadly. The sandworms were extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sensed each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. 

===Size===

By anyone's standards, Sandworms could grow to an enormous size. Dr. [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Wellington Yueh]] cited that specimens "up to 450 meters long" were spotted by observers in the deep desert. To make a comparison, the largest animal on earth was believed to be a Blue whale measuring in at only 33 meters, or about 12% of an average sandworm's length. 

Many things commonly associated with Arrakis are surrounded in myth and mystery, and the sandworms are no exception. Some people believe that worms from 700 to even 1000 meters existed in the southern pole regions. This was neither confirmed nor denied. See [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] during his trial of the sandrider for further reading regarding their maximum observed size. 

===Age===

Due to the difficulty of studying these creatures, not much was originally known about the wild sandworms. The longevity of the sandworm was supposedly extreme, estimated in the thousands of years. 

===Appearance===

[[File:Hr-giger-dune-worm-xii.jpg|thumb|Sandworm as envisioned by H.R. Giger]]
Their skin was thick, rough, and orange colored. It served the simple function of armor and was comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size. These scales overlapped and interlocked to form the armor that protected it against internal sand invasion. 

As the Fremen discovered, this armor, while all but impenetrable, could be exploited. By prying open one or more of the scales, the integrity of the armor would be compromised; sand was now free to enter into the sandworms softer insides. This would cause intense irritation for the sandworm. The beast would then roll itself until the prone scale was at the highest point from the desert floor, thus minimizing the amount of sand that could enter. 

A fremen poised to "ride" the beast as it rolled its open scale towards its highest point could literally mount the worm. As long as the scales remained open, the sandworm would not submerge. [[Maker hook]]s were then placed towards the front of the beast to control lateral movement. As a result, wormriding became a viable, even sacred, method of transport for the Fremen across the surface of the planet. Indeed, distances were even measured in "sandworms". A 20-worm ride would be a far, long and difficult journey. 

A sandworm's internal workings resembled that of a massive blast furnace, producing intense heat and flames. This in turn provided the environmental link of supplying oxygen to the nearly plantless Arrakis. The mouth was positioned at the forward end of the creature and could easily consume gigantic objects such as [[spice harvester]]s. 

===Smell===

The smell of the sandworm has been particularly documented. A strong, flinty, cinnamon smell exuded from the beast, especially from the mouth. Some said it could be smelled before seen. The presence of the spice melange was intense and so was its odor. 

===Lightning===

The approach of a sandworm towards its breach-point was often indicated by the dry lightning that frequently occurred in the area; a result of static electricity being discharged into positively-charged air. 

===Diet===

The main component of the sandworm's diet was sand, and other inorganic and dry components of the Arrakis crust. It is also believed they sifted the [[sand-plankton]] for nourishment. 

===Water Poisoning===

Water was fatal to a sandworm, even in small doses. Water that entered a sandworm's body would act as catalyst to accelerate its metabolism to the point that it became unstable and its life support failed. This was a violent and presumably painful death for the sandworm. It was necessary however, in so far that the byproduct of the sandworm/water mixture was the highly toxic poison called the [[Water of Life]], which [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mothers]] used on various occasions. 

===Creation===

The process of sandworm creation began when [[sandtrout]] banded together after converging on a store of water deep beneath the surface of Arrakis. Indeed, water did occur naturally on Arrakis. However, due to the aforementioned process, it was always destroyed. The sandtrout/water mixture was then converted it into a liquid chemical that the sandworm was capable of digesting without being poisoned. On a side note, this chemical could erupt up to desert's surface in a violent explosion called a [[pre-spice mass]]. 

The sandtrout that survived this event would then coalesce and complete the metamorphosis into a young sandworm. 

==Cultural Impact==

Insofar as the sandworm was essential to the creation of the spice melange, on a macro scale the sandworm had an enormous impact on humanity. 

To the planet's Fremen population, the creature was a spiritual symbol of their faith and saw them as physical embodiments of the One God of their original [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] religion. Within Fremen culture the sandworm had several additional names, notably The Maker and [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously meant Old Man of the Desert, Old Father Eternity, or Grandfather of the Desert. 

Young sandworms were used by the Fremen for special ceremonies. Inducting a new [[Sayyadina]] or reverend mothers was a prime example of the sandworms essential cultural role. 

==History==

===Atreides Empire===

After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the Zensunni religion across the known universe, the reverence paid to the sandworm spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], due to the fact that he had become something of a hybrid, both man and worm. 

The terraforming of Arrakis posed a grave risk to the sandworm, which found life outside the arid desert fatal. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the sandworm once again thrive on Arrakis for approximately another 1500 years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during the [[Scattering/XD|Scattering]]. This exercise yielded questionable success. 

===Death on Rakis===

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on Rakis, including, it was believed, the remaining sandworms. However, this was not before [[Miles Teg/XD|Miles Teg]] and [[Darwi Odrade]] had managed to capture a sandworm. Held in an artificial environment on [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]], the secret and temporary base of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, this worm would have been the key to re-seeding its population. 

===On Other Planets, In Other Places===

====Chapterhouse====

The first place that Odrade's sandworms began a new spice cycle was on the Bene Gesserit homeworld of [[Chapterhouse]]. After their introduction, the sand trout began to turn the once-lush world into a desert. Eventually, [[Mother Commander]] [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]] of the combined Gesserit/Matres group, The [[New Sisterhood]], was able to pay for starships and other off-world materials with the melange that the worms produced. 

====Qelso====

Odrade's sisters also colonized the lush climate world of [[Qelso]], and after only 30 years, the sandworms turned it into a very inhospitable place to live. [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]'s [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]'', visited the planet as they fled from the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]]. They tried to convince the inhabitants of Qelso they were fighting a losing battle, to which the natives did not agree. Later, when Duncan assumed his role as the combined [[Evermind]] and Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], Idaho revisited the planet. He left sentient [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] robots with the [[ghola/XD|gholas]] of [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] and [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], to help divide the planet into lush areas and sand areas. 

====Synchrony====

On the Day of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]], when tantamount change came to the universe, the ghola of Leto Atreides II and [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] were left aboard the ''Ithaca'' as prisoners near the [[Cathedral]] on [[Synchrony]]. To disrupt the ordered pattern of life for the Thinking Machines and their rulers, [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], Leto and Sheeana released the giant six sandworms and their leader, [[Monarch]], held in the ''Ithaca's'' cargo bay. The worms cascaded over and under the surface of Synchrony, in which they destroyed buildings and caused chaos and mayhem. After the banishment of Omnius and the sharing of Erasmus and Idaho, Leto decided to merge his cellular sturcture with that of the giant worms; in which he believed he fulfilled his role in the universe and his personality. 

After Idaho gave Synchrony to the a combined custodianship of Bene Gesserit, [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]], and Thinking Machine overlordship, the worms still produced spice in a segregated portion of the planet. 

====Buzzell====

A ghola of the famed [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff/XD|Tylwyth Waff]] produced a genetic variant of the sandworm, which thrived in water, called the [[seaworm]]. Under [[Spacing Guild/XD|Guild]] guidance, and with their funds and technology, Waff introduced this changed worm into the seas of the water-world of [[Buzzell]]. These worms produced a super-potent version of melange called [[ultraspice]] in a liver-like organ in their body. 

====On Rakis Again====

After Waff provided the Guild with the seaworms of Buzzell, he began what he considered his most holy mission—returning the worm to Rakis. He released a variant of the sandworm in the sands which had re-inforced armor-piercing appendages at the mouth of the giant creature. Waff's attempt to re-seed [[Arrakis/XD|Dune]] with these creatures failed, as they died over the period of a week. 

On the Day of Kralizec, as Waff was about to give up in futility, he heard a deep rumbling far underground. Sandworms, with the consciousness of Leto II, the Tleilaxu [[Prophet]] within them, burst forth from deep underground the planet. It had turned out that the worms had survived the Matres bombardment forty years earlier, and would thrive again on the world.

Alia Atreides/XD

{{Ex-Or,DE|Alia Atreides}}
[[Image:AliciaWitt.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Alicia Witt played Alia Atreides in the 1984 ''Dune'' movie]]
'''Alia Atreides''' ([[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), also known as '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' to the [[Fremen]] and called '''Hawt the Fish Monster''' on the outer worlds, was the posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], born on the planet [[Arrakis]]. She was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides]]. As [[regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based on the cult of her personality. She later leapt to her death in defiance of the possession by the spirit of a younger [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] retained in her [[Other Memory]].

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Alia was still in the womb when Jessica took the [[Water of Life]]. Thus she was [[pre-born]], and highly susceptible to [[Abomination]] from before birth.

After living with the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] for several years, she was present in the palace in [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]] when her brother and his forces successfully conquered the combined forces of the [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Emperor's]] [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] and [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]]. During the invasion she poisoned Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] - her maternal grandfather - with a [[Gom Jabbar]].

Alia, having been born a full [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]], was able to help [[Paul Atreides/XD|Emperor Paul]] as he consolidated his rule in Arrakeen and throughout the [[Known Universe/XD|Known Universe]]. She helped him rule on Dune while he was off-planet visiting [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], helping to settle matters between the Fremen and other locals.

When the former Count [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] and his wife, [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]], brought their young daughter [[Marie Fenring]], to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], to be raised by  Paul and the Royal Court, Alia was chosen as her companion. Alia was astute and observed Marie, and noted her fighting style strengths and weaknesses. Some time later when the Fenring's re-joined their daughter, the couple sprang their assassination plot at a celebratory banquet.

Alia was able to kill Marie Fenring first before Marie was able to kill Paul, driving a blade deep into her body. This action earned her the nickname of Alia of the "Knife", and Alia was proclaimed a heroine.

===Regency===
[[Image:Alia01.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alia as Imperial Regent]]
====Establishing her rule====
With the seeming death of Paul, and his children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule, Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] of the [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides Empire]]. She was corrupted by power and established a cult of personality, using rich trappings and grandiose titles such as the [[Mahdinate]] to build considerable political weight.

====Against Bronso====
It was during this time of crisis when her mother Jessica, secretly visited Arrakis to observe the state and condition of her twin grandchildren, and the rising paranoia of her daughter against true and supposed enemies. Alia lashed out against Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso of Ix/XD|Bronso Vernius]] of [[Ix/XD|Ix]], and had him executed when he wrote of Paul's failings as Emperor. It was also during this time, that she and the ghola of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] became husband and wife.

====Into Abomination====
Shortly thereafter, Alia fell fully into Abomination, and was secretly tormented by the living personalities of countless ancestors. Chief among these was the personality of Vladimir Harkonnen, who sought to use his granddaughter as a tool to reclaim power from beyond the grave.

====Relationships====
[[Image:Alia02.jpg|thumb|250px|As Abomination, Alia takes comfort in the metaphorical arms of Baron Harkonnen]]
Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with Fremen was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.

Though she loved and admired Paul, her brother, she also partly resented his influence. And her love for Duncan Idaho was ultimately destroyed by a casual affair with [[Javid]], one of her priests who secretly served the Fremen insurgents who plotted against her.

====Death====
During the same years in which she held herself aloof from family and friends, Alia indulged in massive doses of [[Spice Melange/XD|melange]], ostensibly for the purpose of broadening her [[prescience/XD|prescient]] vision. However, Alia lacked her brother's prescient ability, and the [[spice trance]] most often failed her. The same drug which had initially keyed her sensitivity to her ancestral voices could be depended upon to keep those same voices from becoming blurred or unavailable. As a result, Alia's heavy melange consumption became a means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors and gave them power.

Alia's actions during her Regency were those of a power-hungry woman aided by the memories of generations of ambitious rulers and princelings. Her every manoeuvre, including her marriage to the first Duncan Idaho ghola, was seen as having been performed in order to solidify her own position, and her manipulation of the children in whose names she ruled was also considered a devious maneuver. Not content with having destroyed herself, she set about to lead her niece and nephew into similarly destructive ways. Since the most direct way of achieving this goal involved the children's becoming enmeshed in their ancestral memories, Alia continually tried to interest them in the spice trance.

Alia ordered the assassination of [[The Preacher]], despite knowing it was her beloved brother. Upon Leto's return from the desert, he gave her a choice, [[Trial of Possession]] or suicide. Realising that she would not pass the Trial, Alia threw herself from a high window to her death, a death that was witnessed by her mother Jessica, the Atreides twins, and Farad'n Corrino. 

Had it not been for her death, Alia could have continued to rule for several centuries by regenerating her cellular structure. According to Fremen tradition, as with all Abominations, the only cure was death.

===Legacy===
The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. In the months prior to Leto II's death, a cult of Alia was discovered on [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] by Duncan Idaho's agents. Ultimately however, Alia's influence vanished after Leto's death, some three and a half thousand years after her own death.

===Ghola ===
Five thousand years later, aboard the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]] the ''[[Ithaca]]'', during the advent of [[Kralizec]], the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Burgh]] decided to decant a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] of Alia in the ongoing and upcoming struggle against the [[Enemy/XD|Outside Enemy]]. Twenty-one years after the captives and crew of the vessel fled [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]], Alia was birthed from an [[Axlotl tank/XD|axlotl tank]], as an "aware" newborn infant again into the world. Sheeana had ordered her tank flooded with changed [[Water of Life]] to raise her consciousness. She was eventually murdered on [[Synchrony]] by a ghola of the Baron Harkonnen.

==Behind the Scenes==

In the ''[[Children of Dune]]'' TV mini-series, Alia kills herself with a [[crysknife]].

Alia was played by three different actresses [[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie]], Laura Burton in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|Dune 2000 miniseries]], and [[wikipedia:Daniela Amavia|Daniela Amavia]] in the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]].

Arrakis
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:Arrakis_planet.jpg|thumb|266px|Artist's portrayal]]
'''Arrakis''', also known as "'''Dune'''", and later "'''Rakis'''" after the fall of [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], is a harsh desert planet located on the far edge of the Old [[Imperium]] in the [[Stars#Alpha Carinae|Canopus]] star system. It later became the Imperium's center under [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib's]] empire. It was the original and for a long time sole source of the [[Spice Melange]], which was vital for [[space travel]].

==Location==
Arrakis was located far from the major populated worlds and their trade routes. It was orbited by two moons: the first and larger of these bore a formation that looked like a human fist; the second had a formation that resembled a [[kangaroo mouse]].

===Fight for Survival===
The fight for survival on the harsh world had long dominated the Fremen's cultural identity. The brutal environment of Arrakis necessitated frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. Also, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of Arrakis to fend off offworld opponents who often possess far superior technology and formal training.

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal tribes, known as [[sietch]]es, which were led by a [[Naib|naib]]. Each sietch resides within one of the many rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood.

Other human settlers included the graben population in the urbanized areas. This population consisted of traders and offworlders who tried to make their living through trading water or spice. The promise of riches through the sale of water to the Fremen and the sale of the spice melange to other worlds brought many people to the more populous areas of the planet.

Arrakis also saw the peoples of [[House|Great Houses]] populate the planet. As a [[fief|siridar fief]] of the [[Imperium]], whichever [[House|Great House]] had possession of this fief would typically maintain a large population that included armies, administrative staff, family members, household staff, a spy network, and [[richece]].

After his successful invasion of Arrakis, the Baron mentions to Nefud that there are 5,000,000 people living on Arrakis. By this he means the people of the towns and villages. He is later stunned to hear from Thufir Hawat that the Fremen account for at least an additional 10,000,000. Given a total population of 15,000,000 on a planet as harsh as Arrakis.

==Environment==
[[Image:L Dune Map.jpg|thumb|North Pole of Arrakis]]
The surface of Arrakis consisted almost exclusively of dry dune deserts, hence the planet's alternative name, ''Dune''. Various weathered mountain ranges stretched across the planet, breaking up the deserts and sheltering the limited native lifeforms. Rock outcroppings also littered the planet's surface.

The atmosphere consisted of 75.4% nitrogen, 23% oxygen<ref>''[[Appendix I: The Ecology of Dune]]''</ref> and negligible amounts of trace gases; given the abundance of oxygen, the atmosphere allowed human beings to live on the planet without respiratory equipment. The production method of atmospheric oxygen sufficient to sustain limited biological life is through sandworm metabolism, which acts like an oxygen-producing factory.

Vast reserves of water were located deep within the mountains of the planet, as well as within countless [[sandtrout]]. Small amounts of water vapor existed in the atmosphere and were harvested via [[windtrap]]s.

The northern pole of the planet sat on a large plate of bedrock and was ringed by mountain ranges. Thus it was protected from [[sandworm]] incursion, until the Fremen, led by [[Paul Atreides]], used [[Atomics|atomics]] to destroy a large section of the [[Shield Wall]] shortly before he proclaimed himself emperor.

This geography, combined with the milder climate, made human habitation at the pole more comfortable and explained the presence of the capital city [[Arrakeen]].

==Biology==
Little native life survived on Arrakis, owing to its scorching heat and dry climate. The various lifeforms that did endure were eclipsed by the [[Sandworm|sandworms]], which roamed the deep deserts of the planet. The [[sandworms]] played an important role in the production of [[Spice Melange|melange]], and they aggressively protected their desert territory from humans and other sandworms alike.

The [[Fremen]], traditionalist human clans, also eked out a life on the planet, existing in the caves of rocky outcrops and mountain ranges that broke up the planetwide desert.

Other lifeforms on Arrakis included [[sandtrout]] (which interplays heavily with the [[Sandworm|sandworm]]), and the [[Muad'Dib (mouse)|kangaroo mouse]], known to the [[Fremen]] as "Muad'Dib." Some forms of flora existed on the planet, including the [[creosote bush]]. Various birds and bats existed in the ecosystems of the planet. Some of these were domesticated by the Fremen.

Specifically, the kinds of life forms that existed on Arrakis included the following:
* Poverty grass
* Ephemerals—chenopods, pigweeds, amarinth
* Scotch broom
* Low lupine
* Vine eucalyptus (from [[Caladan]])
* Dwarf tamarisk
* Shore pine
* Candelilla
* Suguaro
* Bis-naga
* Shrubs and bushes, including camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa, burrow bush, sand verbena, evening primrose, incense bush, smoke tree, and creosote bush
Various animals were part of the ecosystem, including the following:
* Burrowing animals, such as kit fox, kangaroo mouse, desert hare, and sand terrapin
* Predators, including the desert hawk, dwarf owl, eagle, and desert owl
* Arthropods, namely, [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], trapdoor spider, biting wasp, and wormfly
* The desert bat

==History==
Before the discovery of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet, Arrakis was of little tactical, biological, or geological interest to the inhabitants of the [[Old Empire|Old Empire.]] When Yansuph Ashkoko discovered it's geriatric effects however, it achieved a little more importance. After the Butlerian Jihad, the powerful effects of the [[Spice Melange|spice]], especially with regard to [[space travel]], quickly made it an essential resource and a focal point for the emerging [[Corrino Empire]]. The discovery of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] noticeably increased Arrakis's importance, until by the time of [[Paul Atreides]] it had become a critical component in the galaxy.

Previous experiments had seen sandworms die shortly after they were transplanted from Arrakis to another world, regardless of how faithful a reproduction of their ecosystem was made. As a result, while Arrakis was a fief of [[House Harkonnen]], the Corrinos sent their Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] to analyze the planet's ecosystem. Kynes' analysis of Arrakis convinced him that the planet was once a lush and fertile world. He believed that through careful and multigenerational planning, Arrakis could once again become a paradise. The Fremen, enchanted by Kynes's stories of large bodies of water, greenery, and mild temperatures not requiring [[stillsuit]]s, followed him with fervor. Kynes became so fascinated by the planet and its people that he married into a Fremen tribe, eventually being absorbed into their culture and coming to be known as a leader among the Fremen. He saw so much potential in the planet and its people that he sought to hide its secrets from the emperor. This practice led eventually to Kynes's death, but not before leaving a legacy and a vision for the Fremen people.

===[[Ascension of House Atreides]] and the [[God Emperor]]===

[[File:Dune_Messiah-Frank_Herbert_(1969)_First_edition-1.jpg|thumb]]

In 10,191 [[A.G.]], [[House Atreides]] arrived on Arrakis and took over control of the planet and spice production. By this time, the planet had for some years been under the brutal control of Atreides enemies [[House Harkonnen]], who managed spice mining operations on behalf of Padishah Emperor [[Shaddam IV]]. The Atreides rule was cut short, however, through a betrayal as part of a conspiracy between Harkonnen and Imperial forces.

House Atreides went into hiding, but after seeking refuge with the Fremen quickly became their leaders through their inherent ability to command loyalty and through their promise that Kynes's vision would be realized through their rule. Three years later, Paul Atreides, under the Fremen name of Muad'Dib, using Atreides family atomics, created a gap in the Shield Wall that had protected Arrakeen. Riding into the city on sandworms, the Fremen defeated Harkonnen and Corrino forces, and [[Paul Atreides]] declared victory and ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Arrakis became the new seat of power for both the Empire and the religious jihad that [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] unleashed upon the known universe.

Eventually, [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] limited interpretation of the [[Golden Path]] strategy led to the terraforming of the planet, carried out by Paul's son [[Leto Atreides II]], the long-lived [[God-Emperor]]. Over several thousand years, Arrakis was transformed into a green and temperate world much more habitable to humans, just as Kynes had hoped. Ultimately, however, the new ecology was dangerous to the giant sandworms, which nearly became extinct under Leto II's rule. During this time, new mountain ranges, forests, and rivers came into existence. Offworld animals were introduced and took root on the planet. Only Leto's [[Sareer]] remained evidence that Arrakis was once a desert planet.

After some 3,500 years of rule, Leto II died while crossing the [[Idaho River]] after the Guardian Wall of the Sareer opened. Leto fell into the river, and his worm-body was destroyed by the water, which was toxic to him. His body decomposed into sandtrout that absorbed water, eventually re-creating the conditions required for the sandworms to appear. Over the next 1,500 years, under the biological terraforming effect of the sandtrout/sandworm cycle, Arrakis gradually returned to being a desert. Also, over long millennia, many names for places had become shortened. Arrakis eventually became known as '''Rakis''', while the city of Arrakeen became known simply as '''Keen'''. After Leto's death, Leto's [[Fish Speakers]], the [[Rakian Priesthood]], and the [[Bene Gesserit]] took control of the planet.

===The Scattering===
Because most of humanity had gone out into [[The Scattering]], the return of the [[Honored Matres]] 1,500 years later caused the most fear about Rakis. The greater portion of humanity of the Scattering had been weaned of any need for melange, now able to safely perform foldspace journeys through the use of [[No-ships]] and [[Navigation machine]]s with no requirement for Spice-reliant Guild Navigators. The Matres in particular saw eliminating spice as a way to break the power brokers, the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood and the [[Tleilaxu]] (the only remaining users of Spice Melange), who had stayed behind in the Empire.

In an attempt to destroy the center of [[spice]] production, the Honored Matres eventually attacked the planet with their spaceborne incinerating [[Weapon, the|Weapon]], an action that destroyed all biological life and rendered parts of the planet's surface akin to fused glass. However, their efforts did not totally succeed, and the Bene Gesserit managed to escape with a ghola of Duncan Idaho; [[Sheeana]]; their leader, [[Darwi Odrade]]; and a single sandworm to [[Chapterhouse]]. The sandworm managed to survive the transplant and revived hopes in the Bene Gesserit to re-create Arrakis, or "Dune," on other planets through the [[Known Universe]].

Upon arriving at the secret Gesserit capital planet of Chapterhouse, Odrade had the worm drowned and had some of its sandtrout placed into the soil. Slowly, the world was terraformed into a planet similar to Dune, with a sandworm [[spice cycle]].

==Trivia==
*The length of day and night on Arrakis at the poles were not explained clearly in the novels by [[Frank Herbert]].
*Little information of the pre-Imperium history of the planet was mentioned in the original novels by [[Frank Herbert]]. However, the prequel novels by his son [[Brian Herbert]] and coauthor [[Kevin J. Anderson]] stated that the existence of Arrakis was known to the [[Old Empire]].
*The name Arrakis is believed to have come from the [[wikipedia:Arabic language|Arabic]] name الراقص ''ar-rāqiṣ'', meaning "the dancer," originally a name for the star [[Wikipedia:Mu Draconis|Mu Draconis]].
*It may also be possible that the name Arrakis derives from the Arabic الرخيص ''ar-rakhīṣ'', meaning "the cheap one" or "the less worthy". Before the discovery of the spice melange, the planet was of no real value, making the name appropriate.
*Another possible source for the name Arrakis is the country of [[wikipedia:Iraq|Iraq]] (an Arabic name derived from the ancient [[wikipedia:Sumer|Sumerian]] city-state of [[wikipedia:Uruk|Uruk]]), which is known for its oil resources, and has been involved in [[wikipedia:Iraq War (disambiguation)|several major conflicts]] as a result.
*Arrakis appears to be largely based on the [[wikipedia:Arabian Peninsula|Arabian Peninsula]], including the desert environment, pseudo-[[wikipedia:Islam|Islamic]] religion, and tribal/nomadic [[wikipedia:Bedouin|Bedouin]] culture.

Pardot Kynes/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Pardot Kynes}}

'''Pardot Kynes''' [d.[[10174 AG|10174 AG]]] was an Imperial [[Planetologist]]. At the request of Emperor [[Elrood Corrino IX/XD|Elrood Corrino IX]], he moved to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] to study the planet various natural phenomena. He remained there and married a native [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] woman, [[Frieth]], with whom he had his only child, [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet-Kynes]].

==History==
===Early life===
[[Image:Pardo & Liet.jpg|thumb|left|Pardot (left) & Liet on Arrakis]]

Kynes' parents were bureaucratic functionaries, sent to work in the Imperial prison of [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]] when he was just a child and went along with them.

Rumors said that his parents had displeased Emperor Elrood Corrino IX somehow, and they had been transferred in disgrace. But young Pardot Kynes had found the wastelands fascinating. After the tutors were finished with him, he'd spent his days exploring the blasted wilderness. He used to take notes and study the scarce ecology that had managed to survive the ancient atomic holocaust.

Later the family was transferred to [[Harmonthep/XD|Harmonthep]] but young Pardot returned to Salusa and wrote definitive, complex reports on the ecology of the planet which were published. Once he was pursued by [[Laza tiger|laza tigers]] there, and survived.

He was an expert and well-respected ecologist, geologist, and meteorologist, with added specialties in botany and microbiology. He could live off the land just about anywhere since his needs were few; the most important of him being the harvesting of scientific knowledge. After Salusa he moved to [[Bela Tegeuse/XD|Bela Tegeuse]] and other worlds.

Eventually he was chosen by Elrood Corrino IX among many candidates and was called to [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]]. There his first experience of the astonishing structures amazed him since he was not accustomed to civilized luxury. There, the Emperor ordered him to move to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] and study the planet, hoping to find how the [[Spice Melange/XD|spice melange]] was created.

===Study of Arrakis Ecology===
Shortly after his arrival to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], Kynes became fascinated by the planet's ecology. Specifically, he began to study moisture on the planet, as well as the relationship the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] maintained with the land. The inhospitable [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]] suffered his presence since he was there by the Imperial order. During one of his first months, he sent to the Emperor two regular progress reports.

Over time, Kynes came to understand the relationship between the [[sandworm/XD|sandworms]] and the spice melange, and the cycle by which spice and sandworms were created. Moreover, Kynes came also to understand the role moisture and water played in this cycle, and how to harness it. Kynes' ideas on reclaiming moisture on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] lead to him developing a plan for the terraforming of the planet, which would eventually see it become a paradise. The strength of Kynes' theories was bolstered by the fact that he accidentally discovered a giant salt pan in the deep desert. This salt pan was evidence that there had once been open water on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], eons prior.

===With the Fremen===
Through his studies of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] ecology, Kynes became intrigued with the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]], and came to realise that their ways of survival in a harsh environment with brutal overseers in the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]] were sources of strength for them. Indeed, Kynes knew that the Fremen had potential as a people.

During an expedition into the deep desert, Kynes discovered three [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] youths were being attacked by six Harkonnen bravos near the village of [[Windsack]]. Kynes managed to kill three of the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]]; the two Fremen youths managed to kill the rest while Kynes tended the fallen one with his [[medpak]]. One of them, [[Ommun]], took his [[groundcar]] with his injured companion, [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]], and Kynes was left with [[Turok]], who guided him to his [[Red Wall sietch|sietch]].

There his fate was to be decided by [[Naib]] [[Heinar]]. The issue was debated hotly, especially since the man was an Imperial agent, but killed Harkonnens. Moreover, he spoke of open water returning to Arrakis, with lush greenery. Eventually the sietch leaders decided that Kynes would be killed. When Kynes' killer, [[Uliet]], confronted him, Kynes reportedly said "Remove yourself", and shoved the man aside. It is unclear of the events that immediately transpired. Regardless, the would-be attacker fell on his own [[crysknife]]. This was taken to be a sign by the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] that Kynes was to be listened to. Eventually, most Fremen took to Kynes' vision for [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]' future. He taught the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] children, including his son, the language of ecology, and eventually managed to have the Fremen infiltrate the Imperial system on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] by having some of them man the Biological Testing Stations.

Weeks after his arrival in the sietch, he composed his first report to the Emperor after a long time, which he delivered to [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]]. Then he [[Fremen wedding|married]] [[Frieth]], [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]]'s sister who tended him while he stayed with them.

===Terraforming Arrakis===
This infiltration allowed for tools to make their way into [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] seitches, where they were used to cut deep into rock to create [[catchbasin|catchbasins]] and [[windtrap|windtraps]] that would collect water. Kynes had the Fremen collect copious amounts of data on the climate, biology and ecosystems of the planet. Through his research, [[sandtrout]] were discovered. Indeed, it was through the sandtrout that Kynes learned the relationship between the spice and [[Shai-hulud]].

After discovering how melange was created, Pardot Kynes turned his attention to planting greenery. First he began with a certain [[poverty grass]], then moved to others including:

* Ephemerals - Chenopods, Pigweeds, Amarinth
* Scotch broom
* Low lupine
* Vine eucalyptus (from [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]])
* Dwarf tamarisk
* Shore pine
* Candelilla
* Suguaro
* Bis-naga
* Shrubs and bushes, including camel sage, [[onion grass]], gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa, burrow bush, sand verbena, evening primrose, [[incense bush]], smoke tree, [[creosote bush]].

Following this, Kynes then introduced various animals, including:

* Burrowing animals: [[kit fox]], [[kangaroo mouse]], [[desert hare]], sand terrapin
* Predators: [[desert hawk]], [[dwarf owl]], [[eagle]], [[desert owl]]
* Insects: [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], trapdoor spider, biting wasp, wormfly
* The desert bat

Once Kynes saw the introduction of all these forms of life, he then began to plant more than two hundred different food plants, including [[cotton]], [[melon|melons]], [[coffee]] and medicinals.

Kynes married into a Fremen seitch and had a son, Liet Kynes. However, he was killed in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] when Liet was nineteen. Liet continued his father's work, both in an official capacity as Imperial Planetologist, but also as Fremen leader, steering them as a people toward an ultimate goal, one that Pardot Kynes had envisioned would take approximately five hundred years. This plan, however, was interrupted by the arrival of [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]].

Chani Kynes/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Chani Kynes}}


[[File:Chanikynes.png|thumb|Chani, by Raúl Allén and Patricia Martin, Dune Graphic novel ]]



'''Chani Kynes''', also known as '''Chanisihayah''', (10,178-10,209) was the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] bound concubine of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], and the mother of his three children: [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], and the twins [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]].

== Upbringing ==
Chani was born on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], the daughter of the half-Fremen planetologist [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]] and his full-Fremen wife [[Faroula]]. She gradually developed into a formidable fighter, and by the time of her father's death was serving under [[naib]] [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]].

== Introduction to Paul ==
When Paul and his mother [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica]] escaped from [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]] after the invasion of [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] they quickly found themselves in the deep desert of Arrakis. There, while running from a [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]] they took refuge in a hidden basin in the rocks, and were intercepted by a group of traveling Fremen, which included Chani.

Her introduction to Paul came during a tense stand-off. Chani was familiar to the Atreides heir because of her appearance in his prescient visions prior to his arrival on Arrakis. But to her Paul was initially a stranger.

== Life with Paul ==
After the integration of Paul and Jessica into the Fremen by Stilgar, Chani began her long-lasting love affair with the young Duke, and eventually bore him a son, [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|Leto]]. However, their first born was murdered by an Imperial raiding party while Paul was leading the attack on the Imperial landing party.

After the defeat of House Harkonnen and [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]] on Arrakis, and Paul's subsequent ascent to Emperor and marriage to [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]], Chani became his official concubine and remained his exclusive partner.

== Life with Muad'Dib ==
Chani remained Paul's emotional rock during the establishment of his rule, and during the first two assassination attempts on his life. She applauded Paul's quick giving over of [[Swordmaster/XD|Swordmaster]] [[Whitmore Bludd]] to the blood-thirsty Fremen mob, after Bludd's failed attempt on the [[Emperor/XD|Emperor]]'s life during the [[Great Surrender]] Ceremony. Later, Chani marveled at Paul's sparing of both [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] and [[Lady]] [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]]'s life, after Hasimir had stabbed Paul deeply with the [[Emperor's Blade]].

== Pregnancy and Death ==
[[Image:Chani-and-Irulan.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chani (left, played by Barbora Kodetová) threatens Irulan (played by Julie Cox) in the ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'' miniseries.]]
Seven years later, when Chani became pregnant once again, Irulan sought to usurp her and become the bearer of Paul's children. She found support with the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]], who feared the impact of Chani's largely-unknown bloodline on their breeding program.

However, Irulan's attempts to terminate Chani's pregnancy through drugs failed. After a traumatic pregnancy (as it was accelerated by Spice, taking only five months instead of nine) Chani gave birth to twins, who Paul named [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].

Irulan's treachery did, however, bring a secondary result. Chani died shortly after giving birth to the twins, due to complications stemming from the drugs Paul's titular wife had been surreptitiously feeding her.

The [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]] [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]] offered immediately to resurrect Chani in an [[Axlotl Tanks|Axlotl Tank]]. Yet despite the temptation, Paul refused, knowing the impact such an event would have on the [[The Golden Path/XD|Golden Path]].

== As a Ghola Re-Born ==
Chani made a re-appearance over 5000 years later, during the time of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]]—the great struggle at the end of the age. Chani was reborn as a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] aboard the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]] ''[[Ithaca]]'', as the Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]] desired to have as many possible strong characters from human-kind's past, in the great fight against the unknown [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]] that was pursuing them.

Chani was resurrected, as well as her husband Paul Atreides, her mother-in-law Jessica Atreides, her father Liet Kynes, and her son Leto Atreides II. As she and Paul matured, she served primarily as a helper and strengthener, as it believed that Paul would face an upcoming great challenge when the ship would be inevitably captured. This belief was reinforced as Paul kept having the same prescient vision over and over—of him bleeding from a deep [[knife]] wound, as he himself looked down upon his bleeding body.

== Kralizec on Synchrony ==
When Chani was in her late teens aboard the ship, the Ithaca was ensnared by the Enemy, who was revealed to be [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], of the reborn [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] Empire. The ship was brought to [[Synchrony]], and the leaders of the crew, including Chani, were brought to heart of the flow-metal machine world, the [[Cathedral]].

Omnius and Erasmus then arranged a forced duel between Paul versus a [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]]-raised clone of himself, named [[Paolo]]. Omnius strongly believed that the victor would emerge as the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]]. Paul lost the duel, and his vision was fulfilled, as he slowly bled to near death.

As Paolo, after over-dosing on the enhanced [[melange/XD|melange]] [[ultraspice]], starved and thirsted to death on one side of Cathedral, Paul fought for his life on the other. As Chani cried over the body of Paul, and encouraged her loved one to stay alive, Jessica was able to tell Paul to mend his body on the cellular level, as he was akin to a full Reverend Mother. Paul succeeded in mending his body and bringing his life fluids back into his vital organs.

The events of Kralizec played themselves out over the next few hours—the banishment of Omnius by the [[Oracle of Time]]; the galaxy wide killing of the [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s by Erasmus; the releasing of the ''Ithaca'''s sandworms onto Synchrony and their subsequent destruction of the city; the ending of the war between mankind and the machines; and the revelation of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] as the ultimate super-being, with Erasmus dying and making Idaho the new [[Evermind]].

As Chani and Paul both had their full memories back, both were relieved that Paul was not the ultimate Kwisatz, and that the great burden of being such, would fall upon Duncan. They would be allowed to live lives of near obscurity. As the years passed, Chani and Paul decided to round out their relationship as husband and wife in happiness, and re-explored the now reborn planet Arrakis, and the galaxy, together.

Liet-Kynes/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Liet Kynes}}
[[Image:Pardo & Liet.jpg|thumb|Pardot & Liet (right) on Arrakis]]
'''Liet-Kynes''', also known as '''Weichih Kynes''' was the son of [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] and his wife [[Frieth]] and the father of [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]] (who became the concubine of [[Emperor/XD|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]]), as well as the adopted father of [[Liet-chih]]. Liet was a prominent imperial planetologist/ecologist of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], the [[Judge of the Change]], and the secret [[Abu Naib]] of all [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] at the time [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] took control of Arrakis in 10,191AG.

==History==
During Liet's childhood, he grew up with Warrick, who was a fellow [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] from [[Red Wall Sietch]]. Friends from early childhood, Warrick accompanied Liet Kynes, on many of the routine and everyday occurrences that Liet experienced as a teenager. Among Imperials, Liet was known by the name Weichih.

===Dominic Vernius===
As the two grew into men, they discovered the hidden hideout of the former [[Earl]] [[Dominic Vernius]] who had established an underground base on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]' [[Southern Polar Region]]. Discovered by the Earl's men while delivering the annual [[melange/XD|melange]] tribute to the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]], Liet and Warrick were led before the renegade nobleman. The exiled leader of [[House Vernius]] agreed to spare the lives of the young duo, and Liet and Warrick agreed to help the help Dominic better hide his base. Released by Vernius, Liet and his close friend never told of the Antarctic location.

===Marriage to Faroula===
As the two progressed into adulthood, their eyes were caught by a young Fremen women named Farola, daughter of the [[Naib]] of their sietch. Liet confided in Warrick that he had written poetry about Faroula, but the ever confident Warrick sadly stated that Liet would probably never share the words with her. Warrick further re-iterated that he, too, was interested in the teen Fremen maiden. Finally, Farola issued a marriage challenge to both, including Liet, leaving them a note in each of their quarters, that she could be found in the far away [[Cave of Birds]]. The first of the two young males to find her, would be her betrothed.

Liet summoned a Giant [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]],and used his [[Maker hooks]] to guide the beast across the sands of [[Dune]]. Sadly, Liet arrived at the Cave just a few moments later than Warrick did, and as Warrick and Faroula pledged their lives to each other, Liet slowly turned around, and did not interrupt his friend's tender moment.

===Salusa Secundus===
Liet left the Sietch soon afterwards, embittered about his loss of the hand of Faroula, and headed for the Antarctic regions of the planet. He left [[Dune]], and joined Vernius at another of his secret bases on [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]]. Liet soon tired of the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino Empire]] prison world, and Liet headed back to Arrakis.

A few months later, Liet gave word to the Sietch that he was returning to his extended family. Liet gave word to Warrick, and told him to meet him in the Southern Polar Region. Warrick was overjoyed, and the two had a short-lived reunion. Warrick explained to Liet that he and Faroula had formally married in Liet's absence; and within a year, their son, [[Liet-chih]] had been born.

===The Coriolis Storm===
On the way back to their ancient homestead, a fierce [[Coriolis storm]] began to come near them from far off in the desert. The sandworm that they were riding fled deep into the sand as the giant storm approached. A small out-cropping of rock, only big enough for one man, was the only shelter that the duo could find. The two lifelong friends struggled as to whom should use the rock shelter, as the other would almost certainly die, due to being exposed to the fercious sand winds.

Warrick debated that Liet should use the shelter, as he was the son of [[Umma]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]]. Liet demanded that Warrick use the shelter, as he had a wife and child to take care of. As neither would "take no for an answer", and the storm was almost upon them, they left their fate to chance, to throwing [[stick]]s. Warrick cast first, and rolled a score of seven; Liet acquired a nine. As the two argued still further, the storm came upon them, and Warrick pushed Liet into the enclosure.

===The Water of Life===
Liet survived unscathed, but Warrick was critically wounded and blinded; the skin scoured from his face and parts of his body. Liet took him back to the Sietch, to the gasps and horrified look of Faroula and the rest of the Fremen. Warrick announced that he had received a prophectic vision from [[Shai-Hulud]] during the sandstorm, and that more would be revealed about the [[Lisan al Gaib]] if Warrick drank from the [[Water of Life]].

After a few short days, [[Sayyadina]] [[Ramallo/XD|Ramallo]] arrived and administered the deadly Water to Liet's close friend. Warrick was quickly poisoned, but began spouting forth utterances as he suffered towards mortality. He vaguely spoke that "they will not be able to control him" in reference to the Lisan, but Ramallo could not adequately interpret his oraclur speakings. Soon, Warrick died in the process.

===Death of Pardot & Birth of Chani===
Almost immediately, Liet married his best friends' widow, with the blessings of the Sietch, and a few years later, little [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]] was born to the Fremen couple. Sadly, Liet's father, Pardot, perished in a cave-in as he checked on the progess of one of the terra-forming stations. Liet-Kynes inherited his father's mantle and served as both the planetary ecologist of Dune and leader of the Fremen. He continued his father's vision of gradually terraforming the planet from a harsh desert world into a temperate world with precipitation, greenery, and open water.

===Involvement with House Atreides===
[[Image:Kynes.jpg|right|thumb|135px|Dr. Liet Kynes, as portrayed by actor Max Von Sydow in the 1984 ''Dune'' Movie.]]
Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Kynes acted as arbiter of succession in regard to the change of [[fief]], as ordered by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam IV]]. Kynes' role was to report to the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] and the Emperor regarding the legality of the processes used by the Atreides in taking control of the planet, after [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] was ordered to leave.

Through his intelligence network, [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Duke Leto Atreides]] quickly came to realise that, as well as maintaining official imperial duties, Kynes also possessed some authority with the Fremen. Reports indicated that Kynes had "gone native". As a result, Duke Leto attempted to show Kynes as much as possible that he was taking control of the planet in an honourable fashion. Moreover, Leto realised that if he could get Kynes on side, it could possibly go a long way in winning the Fremen over, who had long-standing suspicion and distrust for the [[Faufreluches]] due to their lack of concern for the welfare of the native inhabitants of Arrakis.

===Loyalty and Death===
Kynes' act of saving the Atreides served to illustrate a point: the Atreides, through their honourable ways, could instill fanatic loyalty in people, to the point where they would give their life for them. Indeed, in the case of Liet-Kynes, this is indeed what happened. Upon the return of House Harkonnen to Arrakis, Kynes was captured as an accomplice to the Atreides, the Fremen, and witness of the dishonourable ways of the Harkonnens. He was abandoned in the desert without water or a stillsuit, and ultimately killed when heat exhaustion, dehydration and delirium prevented him from escaping a massive [[spice blow]].

== Legacy ==
Kynes was survived by his daughter, Chani, who later became concubine of Paul. As a result, he was grandfather to the [[God-Emperor]], [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], and his twin sister, [[Ghanima Atreides]]. Kynes' descendants continued the terraforming of Arrakis, until it became a lush and fertile world.

==Ghola During Kralizec==
Kynes was one of the first historical figures reborn as part of [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]]'s ghola project aboard the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]''. His ''[[Ghola/XD|ghola]]'' grew up on the vessel, and formed a close bond with the ''ghola'' of his former friend [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]]. His memories are successfully restored, however Kynes refused to discuss the experience with the other ''gholas''.

After a decade of wandering, the no-ship found the planet [[Qelso]], which was slowly being converted to a desert by [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]]s seeded previously by the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]]. Kynes and Stilgar stayed behind to help a group of natives both slow the advance of the desert, but prepare for the inevitable aridity of the world. Later, following [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]'s merging with the independent robot [[Erasmus]], Duncan returned to Qelso with an army of [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]]s to halt the spread of the desert.

Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)}}

[[File:Paul Muad'Dib Calling His First Sandworm (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb]]{{Quote|The hawk and the mouse are the same!|[[Warrick]]|Dune: House Harkonnen}}
'''Muad'Dib''' was the name adopted by [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] after he was accepted by the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] as one of their own.

== Symbolism ==

The symbolic definition is broader in complexity.

It was part the chosen name of manhood that Paul selected when he was accepted into the Fremen. It was one of two names that Paul maintained within the tribe.  [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] explained that the first, Usul, meant "strength of the base of the pillar". That was his secret name, his troop name, that only Sietch Tabr could use and none other may presume.

The second name, Muad'Dib, is that by which Paul was known openly. Paul's choice of the name pleased and impressed Stilgar, and other Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]].

{{quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib.|Stilgar|Dune}}.

Although the English pronunciation of this word calls for a long "i", there is an almost exact word in Arabic like it (Mu'adib), which means "private tutor" or "teacher". It used to be that the Caliphs, the rulers of the Muslim world, would hire a Mu'adib to teach their children. The practice seemed to be common for other strata of society as well. 

== Paul-Muad'Dib ==

Paul was reluctant to throw away his [[House Atreides/XD|full past]] and get rid of the full name his [[Leto Atreides I/XD|father]] gave him, which is why he first wished to be called Paul-Muad'Dib.  Unfortunately, this name was soon forgotten and became simply "Muad'dib". Also, it was hoped that by keeping the name his father gave him, he could prevent the mass slaughter that would occur later in his name. Sadly, he could not.

The meanings of both Usul and Muad'Dib have powerful ramifications and foreshadowing for the purpose Paul has on Arrakis.

After escaping the successful invasion of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harokonnen]], and proving their value to the Fremen, Paul and his mother [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], were accepted into [[Sietch Tabr]] by the [[Naib]], Stilgar.

Paul was instructed to take a Fremen word as his new name. While lost in the deep desert prior to being intercepted by Stilgar and his clan, Paul had spotted a small but nimble creature foraging on a rock outcrop. The creature had been a [[desert mouse]]. Upon asking the name of the creature, and being told it was called ''"Muad'Dib"'' by the [[Fremen/XD|native Fremen]], he chose it as his new name.

His choice in name was also marginally influenced by the prescient visions he had begun to have after arriving on [[Dune/XD|Dune]]. In one recurring vision he saw throngs of Fremen chanting the word ''"Muad'Dib"'' at him in a subservient manner.

Usul
{{Original}}
{{DE}}
'''Usul''' was a [[Fremen]] word meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar".

It was the name given to [[Paul Atreides]] when he was given sanctuary with [[Sietch Tabr]] by its [[naib]], [[Stilgar]]. Openly Paul was to be referred to as [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]]. However, Usul was the private name used within the Sietch. It was to be the name his beloved [[Chani]] would use for him, and the last word she cried before she died giving birth to their children.

Stilgar gave Paul this name after witnessing him defeat one of their finest warriors, [[Jamis]]. It would appear that Stilgar saw a certain strength in the boy.

Like various other Fremen words, the term "[[wikipedia:Usul|Usul]]" comes from the Arabic word أصول, meaning "fundamental principle(s)".

Zensunni
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:C306782831b898192fcecff680c9e755.jpg|thumb|Rogue Zensunni -Fanart]]


'''Zensunni''' was a religious belief system prominent with many cultures spread across the [[Known Universe]], especially those descended from disadvantaged and enslaved peoples.

== History ==

Little is known of the evolution of the Zensunni faith. What is beyond doubt is that the Zensunni belief was an amalgam of two ancient religions: ''Sunni Islam'' and ''Zen Buddhism''.

They were followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of [[Maometh]] (the so-called "[[Third Muhammed]]") about [[1381 BG]]. The Zensunni religion is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to "the ways of the fathers." Most scholars name [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] as leader of the original schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male spokesman for his second wife, [[Nisai]] <ref> '''''[[Dune]]''''', '''Termiology of the Imperium, page 345'''</ref>.

The Zennsunni faith was based on the teachings of the [[Ulema]] and thought to have it's origins in the [[fiqh]]. It was partially preserved in the [[Book of Kreos]] and the [[Shah-Nama]]. One of the zensunni names of [[god]] was [[al-mutakallim]], they also believed in a number of [[kiswa]] such as [[Auliya]], the female at the left hand of God, [[shaitan]] and his realm of [[Gehenna]]. One [[Zensunni Philosopher]] of note was [[Bu Ji]].

Later, the Zensunni predisposition was manipulated by the [[Bene Gesserit]], via their [[Missionaria Protectiva]] arm and [[Panoplia Propheticus]] strategy, for their own political objectives. One of the most prominent homes of Zensunni beliefs, [[Arrakis]], was of particular interest in this regard. The exclusivity of the critical [[Spice Melange]] on the planet made the resident [[Fremen]], staunch followers of Zensunni, of natural interest to the Bene Gesserit.

The emergence of the powerful [[Paul Atreides]], and his adoption of Fremen ways, gave Zensunni beliefs a dramatic new popularity. After his ascension to [[Emperor]] Paul embarked on a ferocious jihad that brought great violence and turmoil. The stark contrast of these actions vis-à-vis pacifist Zensunni beliefs was not lost on some of the faithful.

==Notes==

*Zensunnism usually is interpreted as a hybrid religion of Sunnitic Islam and Zen-Buddhism, however in Islam Sunna usually refers to the Sunna or example of the Prophet Mohammed, which does not seem to play a large role at all within either original Zensunni nor later Fremen religion just as both seem to contain very little obvious Buddhist elements.
*Sunna may refer to Usus, consense or tradition, even local tribal tradition within arabic culture, Zen refers to practices of insight and self-control. Indeed Fremen society relied much on both, tribal tradition and practices of harsh discipline and  self-control.
*Despite many arabic names and quotes Fremen and Zensunni faith share very little similarities with orthodox islam.In many aspects they are closer to rather marginal esoteric schools of Islam or even classic Gnosticism and perhaps pre-islamic arabic-pagan traditions. Maybe the so-called [[third islamic movement]], perhaps already the [[second islamic movement]], had abandoned much of traditional [[terra]]n islam of the [[First Islam]] movement and replaced it with esoteric teachings and practices drawn from zen-buddhist self-control and immersion techniques as well as rather abstract and removed notions of god.
*"[[Zensunni Catholicism]]" was one of the main religious groups who contributed to the [[Orange Catholic Bible]].It is however unknown what Zensunni Catholicism exactly refers to. While Many readers interpret it as a blend of Zensunnism with catholic christianity it might also refer to a universal or holistic Zensunnism.

Uliet/XD
{{mixed}}

[[File:Uliet.png|thumb|Uliet , Dune House Atreides #4, by Dev Pramanik  and  Alex Guimarães]]



'''Uliet''' ("Older Liet") [d. [[10153 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] who was an accomplished worm rider and one of the greatest fighters in [[Red Wall Sietch]], proven many times in battle against the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]]. 

When the [[Council of Elders]] decided to have [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] sacrificed, [[naib]] [[Heinar]] gave him a [[crysknife]] poisoned with the [[Water of Life]].

He approached his victim accompanied by two [[watermen]] who would collect his blood and water after his death. As Kynes was explaining his vision to the Fremen he approached Kynes, who, oblivious to his fate, told him "Remove yourself". Uliet realising Kynes' visions, did not wish to be remembered as a destroyer of dreams.

Kynes' sermon affected Uliet's mind, and started to believe that he is a messenger from God, but he knew that he could not abandon his mission; the blessed crysknife should not be scathed back before tasting blood. So he fell on it. Uliet took his own life instead of Kynes', and the watermen took his body instead to the [[deathstill]]. Seeing this event, the Fremen who listened to Kynes called him ''[[Umma]]''.

The shade of Uliet was advanced to the [[sadus]], the throne of heavenly judges.

Jessica Atreides/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Jessica Atreides}}
[[Image:Jessica.jpg|right|thumb|The Lady Jessica, bound concubine of the Duke Leto Atreides, played by [[Francesca Annis]]]] '''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG]]<ref name=time>Timeline</ref>-[[10256 AG]]) was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/DE|Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son Emperor [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother/DE|Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

== Biography== 

===Upbringing=== 

A result of the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]]<ref name=jessica>Atreides-Harkonnen, Lady Jessica</ref> and an unknown mother. The Bene Gesserit breeding charts note that Jessica's birth mother was named [[Tanidia Nerus/DE|Tanidia Nerus]]. She was raised from birth by the Bene Gesserit, who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]] heir Leto I, to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen/DE|Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach/DE|Kwisatz Hadarach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. 

Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced Bene Gesserit training on [[Wallach IX/DE|Wallach IX]] enduring 14 years of education in "mothering".  She learned to understand and control her organism to be the fittest possible mother (as to the Sisterhood biology was destiny); and also to observe, understand and control others, and thus keep everyone  psychological "children" to her "maternal influence" (which, to the Sisterhood, was the strongest life-force).<ref name=jessica/>

===With Duke Leto===

In [[10175 AG]], the headmistress of the Bene Gesserit school on Caladan offered her as a present to Duke Leto as a [[Bound Concubine]].  She was given via one of his buyers, after careful investigation by the [[mentat/DE|mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat/DE|Thufir Hawat]]. It was thus with some trepidation that the buyer introduced Jessica to Leto and discreetly removed himself from their presence.

After a few hours the Duke arrived for his meal, with the new concubine on his arm (a privilege never granted any other concubine) and during the dinner, he included Jessica in the table conversation. The next day, Leto announced to the worried buyer that he was dismissed as he no longer required the services of a buyer, and offered him the position of a quartermaster-general; to take charge of all trade to and from Caladan.

Although she had orders to conceive a daughter, Jessica knew that the loving intimacy of equal free selves was the only true generative force in the universe, and gave the Duke the son he always wanted, thus embracing a much fuller and substantive motherhood that the Sisterhood ever projected.<ref name=jessica/> It was announced 5 months later that the Lady Jessica was to bear the Duke's first child and a boy was born 4 months later, and was named Paul. This new family led the Duke to adopt a more domestic lifestyle. He threw himself fully into the education of his son, so that he would grow up worthy of the Atreides crest. 

In [[10191 AG]], when House Atreides was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with Leto and their son Paul. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV/DE|Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

When [[House Harkonnen/DE|House Harkonnen]] seized control of Arrakis, Leto was killed, and Jessica and Paul became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]].<ref name=time/> Her grief over losing Leto, who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with his daughter [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]].

[[Stilgar/DE]] had received an order from [[Liet-Kynes/DE]] to take a band out into the desert with in search of Paul Atreides and his mother and messages sent back to the sietch by the [[Shadout Mapes/DE]] had indicated that Jessica might be something more. [[Chani Kynes/DE]] was in that group, and [[Ramallo/DE]] wished to hear her impressions of the encounter. Jessica bested Stilgar in single combat using her [[weirding way]]s. The hot-tempered [[Jamis/DE]] challenged Jessica's part in the legend and Paul killed him with a knife.<ref name=chani>Atreides, Lady Chani</ref> [[Stilgar/DE]] brought them to the [[Sietch Tabr]].<ref>Agarves, Buer</ref>

===Reverend Mother=== 

[[Image:Dune210106-12.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|The Lady Jessica takes the Water of Life]] The Fremen of Arrakis were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own Reverend Mother [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her as she could not live long enough for Chani to replace her.<ref name=chani/> Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged Reverend Mother, Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm/DE|sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life/DE|Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to Reverend Mother status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination/DE|Abomination]].

Jessica ahd misgivings concerning the "marriage of youth" between her son and Chani.<ref name=chani/>

When the existence of Alia was learned by the Bene Gesserit, they immediately ordered secret assassinations of both Jessica and Alia in spite of the enormous risks, but more rational thought prevailed, and they decided to study this Abomination for information needed to destroy her, while wooing her mother back into the ranks.<ref name=alia>Atreides, Alia</ref> 

Jessica led negotiations proceeding Paul's formal acceptance by the [[Landsraad/DE]] and the [[Spacing Guild/DE]], with Chani as her assistant in bargaining with the outgoing emperor, resulting to Jessica often saying, that she hoped never to have to negotiate any kind of terms against a Fremen, since their ferocity in battle paled before their determination at a conference table. During one of assassination attempts against Chani, Jessica focused her attention on Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]], soon to be Paul's Consort-in-name. She was genuinely stunned, and a brief expression of surprised delight escaped her (as she had been angered by her secondary place) before her Bene Gesserit training could conceal it, convincing Jessica of her innocence.<ref name=chani/>

During the [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/DE|Muad'Dib's Jihad]], Lady Jessica stayed on Caladan, refusing the Fremen any access to the planet, including religious pilgrimage. 

During her stay there, she outthought and outgrew her BG conditioning. After Paul's disappearance, she proved herself a formidable diplomat, intriguer and psychological warrior countering Alia's plots against Atreides ideals.<ref name=jessica/>

Her last involvement with the Sisterhood was compiling the [[Report on Alia Atreides]] in 10211. She made vigorous attempts to change the condemning tone of the final report.<ref name=alia/> 

===Later Years===

[[Image:Jessica2.jpg|thumb|Lady Jessica by M.Stribling]]Jessica returned to Arrakis, long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II/DE|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the Bene Gesserit. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her Fremen  allies to help protect them. 

However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, Alia, who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late Vladimir Harkonnen, who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

The Sisterhood sent a delegation to Caladan, asking the help from Lady Jessica to investigating her daughter. Jessica knew that the purpose of her Sisters would be to destroy the Abomination, so she accepted to help Alia to save herself. For her protection against her murdering daughter, in [[10218 AG]] Jessica left [[Castle Caladan/DE|Castle Caladan]]. Soon after she arrived to Arrakeen, [[Duncan-10208]] delivered her to [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]] to [[Salusa Secundus/DE|Salusa Secundus]]. and Alia expanded her control of the [[Imperium/DE]].<ref name=alia/><ref name=time/>.

There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

In 10220 Jessica, Leto, Ghanima, Farad'n, even Duncan Idaho and [[Gurney Halleck/DE]] planned against Alia.<ref name=alia/> 

Jessica returned to Arrakis and watched her son Paul; and daughter Alia, die.

==Character and traits==

In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the Kwisatz Haderach) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

===Archetypal analysis===

By application of the material found ''[[The Book of Ghanima]]'' ([[RRC]] 13-A700) where Ghanima Atreides studies the roots of her name, it seems that Jessica is the fulfillment of Archetypes prophesied by the ancient [[Terra]]n seer [[Seegee Jhung]] who outlined a theory explained the ''anima'' aspect of her name.  

Applied to the Jhung's archetypes, Jessica was raised as a Mother, evolved into Hetaira; as a Hetaira she infused her Medial wisdom with personal caring.<ref name=jessica/> 

Jessica always believed the BG dogma that Archetypes were illusions the BG should use to manipulate the gullible.<ref name=jessica/>

She often complained that she was raised as a "brood mare". She confounded her teachers by transcending their concept of maternity and evolved into another dimension of selfhood.  Although she did not so much revolt, the BG thought her an unSisterly rebel against their discipline, when she became the true companion of the Duke. Although taken as the Duke's Lady, Jessica never became his wife; few societal sanctions supported/confined her Archetypal companionate vitality as a Hetaira, a need which she insteilled to her descendants. She never stopped loving him for the rest of her life.<ref name=jessica/>

She discovered her Amazonian strength while pregnant in the wilderness of Arrakis and displayed her fullest against the Abominable companionship of Alia and Vladimir. As an Amazon she preserved independent individual selfhood against the harsh deserts of Dune, the political turmoils, and the onslaughts of the collective unconscious. Her Amazon's resourceful objectivity eventually outgrew her BG conditioning.<ref name=jessica/>

As a Medium, and thanks to her balanced and tuned self-consciousness, she bridged the unconscious world and the human community, as a Reverend Mother.  During the [[spice-trance]], the [[spice/DE|melange]] catalyzed her evolution but her psyche stabilized and vivified it. As a Medium she maintained a cosmic perspective on her involvements and her Medial energies saved her from the centripetal egotism (which crushed her children).<ref name=jessica/> 

These experiences introduced Jessica to her psyche's core, she found the Motherhood which the Sisterhood had lost, and she sensed the Great Mother within herself, debilitating her skepticism. As a Mother, she felt the Great Mother as an exterior presence sought after Liet-Kynes and Leto II. She understood that all forms, processes and roles are channels for the Great Mother's creative and sustaining energies. To that teaching she devoted her mature life, which she imparted to Farad'n.<ref name=jessica/>

Buer Agarves/DE
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-10-01-17-46-1.png|thumb]]


'''Buer Agarves''' ([[10185 AG]]-[[10219 AG]])- once a [[Tabrite]], then aide to [[Zia]], who directed [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]]'s temple guards during her regency. 

He was a round-faced small man, characteristicly nervous, with sensual good looks and an unshakable faith in the divinity of the Atreides. Agarves kept a Diary fragments of which were used as a source for the [[Dune Encyclopedia]].
==Biography==
A relative to the [[Naib/DE]] [[Stilgar/DE]], Agarves was born at [[Sietch Tabr/DE]] to [[Zagros]] and [[Nacher]]. He was the only son in a family of four sisters. When he was 6 years old, he witnessed the arrival of [[Paul Atreides/DE]] and his mother [[Jessica Areides/DE|Jessica]]. Among his playmates were the sons of Stilgar and [[Harah/DE]] in the [[yali]] of Paul. He was trained in language and other skills and the ways of desert travelling. He enjoyed playing around the [[Sietch/DE]] and hunting [[scorpions]] by light of a [[handglobe]].

When he was 24 he witnessed the return of Paul with pregnant [[Chani/DE]]. He heard the dramatic events attending the birth of the Atreides twins, including how blind Paul threw a [[crysknife/DE]] killing [[Scytale/DE]], the [[Face Dancer/DE]], something that greatly increased his awe for Paul.

Following Muad'Dib's disappearance into the desert, Stilgar brought Agarves to [[Arrakeen/DE]] where he succumbed to the softness of luxurious urban life and water-fat, "like a [[sandworms/DE|worm]] to the sound of a [[thumper]]" as a comentator noted. At first he served in the [[Temple Commissary]], then held several minor positions in the [[Office of the Minister of Finance]] and a short stint in the [[Agriculture Experimental Center]]. 
===Service to Alia===
It was then when he then came to the attention of [[Zia]], the Amazon aide of [[Alia Atreides/DE]] and commander of the Temple guards, and was brought into regent Alia's service.

One of his first duties was to accompany [[Javid]] to Sietch Tabr with messages from Alia. In his notes, Agarves attended Javid the morning they went to Stilgar's quarters. As he stood aside to allow Javid to enter, [[Duncan Idaho/DE]] turned and stabbed Javid with his knife. Agarves drew his own but feared to challenge the fabled Idaho. As he was frozen in indecision, he watched as Idaho goaded Stilgar into a killing rage resulting to Idaho's death.

He returned to recount the outcome of that final mission and to carry Stilgar's "final obedience". Apparently he had seen many of Alia's rages and feared for reprisal if she learned he had stood by and done nothing. So he gave the [[Temple Records]] account "the small lie", reporting that he had been summoned by Stilgar to behold the dead bodies of Javid and Idaho being prepared for [[Huanui]], only after Stilgar had killed Idaho. Alia asked him if he could do anything, and Agarves feared that she penetrated his lie, but Agarves felt justified.

{{quote|For who knows, what the Heavenly Regent wanted me to do? Kill Idaho for killing Javid? Or Stilgar for Idaho? Who can know the mind of the Womb of Heaven?|Buer Agarves|Diary}}

It was common knowledge that he soon took [[Javid]]'s place in Alia's bed and became her "little plaything". Alia commanded him to kill Stilgar promising him to become Naib of Tabr. Shocked by the order, Agarves actively started looking for his old Naib who had fled to the desert with [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima]] and [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]]. With the limited resources Alia allowed him, and her frequent recallings to Arrakeen, his plan proved fruitless. Alia confessed that her initial command was a result of ravaging grief but now she had forgiven him and only wanted Stilgar to return to Sietch Tabr; Alia also gave him as a parting gift new boots, where a transitter was secreted. Agarves,who was now revlted by her excesses, believed her and left for [[Red Chasm Sietch/DE]]. Stilgar's friend [[Nurel]] was persuaded to send a [[distrans]] to Stilgar requesting a parley. 

Stilgar, who had taken refuge with his party in an abandoned [[djedida]] consented, and Agarves with 9 companions were taken blindfolded there. Agarves delivered Alia's terms of pardon to Stilgar, and also denounced her openly. Shortly after however, her forces, who followed his transmitter, swarmed in the meeting room. Shortly before being overwhelmed, and exactly as Alia had hoped, Stilgar stabbed Agarves in his chest.

Alia Atreides/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Alia Atreides}}

[[File:Alia.png|thumb|Alia Atreides]]

'''Alia Atreides''', aka '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' and '''Womb of Heaven''' ([[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), born in planet [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]]. Posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/DE|Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Jessica]], was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]].

[[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based in the cult of her personality. In 10219 AG she committed suicide after being overpowered by [[Leto Atreides II/DE|Leto II]] and having succumbed to the [[Abomination/DE|possession]] by her grandfather, the [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]].

==Biography==
===Pre-birth===
While [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Jessica Atreides]] was pregnant with Alia, she went through the [[Water of Life/DE|Water of Life]] ceremony to become a [[Reverend Mother/DE|Reverend Mother]]. The [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] did not know she was pregnant, but she could not refuse the "illuminating poison", even if she knew the effects; Alia's consciousness was permanently altered and became the first of the Atreides [[pre-born]], something Jessica's Bene Gesserit superiors had long feared.

===Early years===
Alia was born in 10191 AG, with full awareness and knowledge of her ancestral memories. After only a few moments of crying, she looked with focused eyes around the birthing room, as in taking in every detail. Fremen women present at her birth, with knowledge abut the [[Abomination/DE|Abomination]], spread the word that the child would bear careful watching. With a curious life she drank the Water of Conception fed to her by [[Harah]], her godmother.

The superstitious Fremen were impressed by her from the first moments, with precocity to every matter. When only 8 months old, she could walk, and exercised thoroughly the water discipline, known to her by accessing the Fremen memories. Her first words were "I love you, Harah". She used to sit alone at the edge of the desert practicing [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] exercises.

This odd sight was enough to make the Fremen consider the shameful [[Test of Possession]], but the stature of [[Paul Atreides/DE|her brother]] as the [[Mahdi]], and her mother, saved her from it.

[[Image:AliciaWitt.jpg|right|thumb]]

When she was only 2 years old, in 10193 AG, she witnessed the last engagements between her brother and Shaddam IV, and Muad'Dib's Fremen. Rather than telling her brother about the death of his son during the fighting, she allowed the [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]] to capture her, and take her to the Emperor. Standing before [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]], his [[Truthsayer/DE|Truthsayer]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] and Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]] (whom she recognised as her grandfather), she unnerved them with her poise and intelligence. Mohiam recognised to her the Abomination the Sisterhood long feared and demanded that she be killed at once, but Shaddam futilely tried to frighten her to learn her brother's whereabouts. The Baron dared to seize her, and in turn was struck with a poisoned needle.<ref name=alia>Atreides, Alia</ref>

That year Mohiam sent a report to the Bene Gesserit General Council concerning Alia's existence and nature, which caused great consternation. The Bene Gesserit immediately ordered secret assassinations of both Jessica and Alia in spite of the enormous risks, but more rational thought prevailed, and they decided to study this Abomination for information needed to destroy her, while wooing her mother back into the ranks.<ref name=alia/>

When Alia was just 14 years old, Paul gives her to a [[Ghola|ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]] as a reward for fealty.<ref name=paul1>Atreides, Paul</ref>

As a young woman during the days of Muad'Dib, Alia led crowds of pilgrims in prayer and prophesied for them. Being the sister of the Mahdi she was revered as Saint Alia-of-the-Knife, the divine huntress who sought out the faithless, who could not be deceived, and "The Womb of Heaven", her most popular title.<ref name=alia/>

Alia attended the funeral of [[Chani Kynes/DE|Chani Kynes]]. [[Harah]] had restrained her from driving [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]] out of the cavern on sight.<ref>Atreides, Chani</ref>

===Regency===
[[Image:Alia01.jpg|left|thumb|Alia as Imperial Regent]]

Paul disappeared into the desert in [[10209 AG]], and with his children [[Leto Atreides II/DE|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule remained under [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]]'s guardianship. Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] '''Alia VIII ''' of the [[Atreides Empire]].<ref name=alia/> Jealous of the love Ghanima had for Harah, she removed her when she was 3.<ref name=ghanima>Atreides, Ghanima</ref>

One of the first acts of her regency was to execute all those who had conspired against Paul, including Mohiam, despite Paul's orders, obviously aware that she was her grandmother. This decision mared her first deviation from Atreides behavior. However she spared only the repentant Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]].

[[File:Dune alia1.jpg|thumb|Alia on the [[Golden Lion Throne]].]]

In the first month of her regency, Alia married [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho-10208]], the Atreides swordmaster. Hundreds of thousands of Imperial subjects atended The ceremony in the capital city of [[Arrakeen/DE|Arrakeen]], which followed the Fremen rites. Alia opted to omit only those sections of the ritual which involved removing her [[crysknife]] from its sheath at her waist, as showing it before a crowd of out-freyn, would alienate the Fremen.

In the next year of the Regency she dissolved the [[Fedaykin]].

With Jessica in [[Castle Caladan/DE|Castle Caladan]], and Stilgar content to defer to her, Alia was in complete control of her twin niece and nephew. She knew they were pre-born like her, knew their capabilities and what large doses of melange had done to Alia and avoided it at all costs, fearing the effects of the spice-trance.<ref name=alia/> Ghanima was both terrified and empathetic, seeing in her what she would easily become.<ref name=ghanima/> Alia encouraged them otherwise, hoping they would share with her the visions of prescience they could tap into. Their lack of cooperation puzzled, annoyed and infuriated Alia.<ref name=alia/>

===Into Abomination===
[[Image:Alia02.jpg|thumb|As Abomination, Alia takes comfort in the metaphorical arms of Baron Harkonnen]]

As rebellions were put down and problems solved, however, Alia found herself more and more subject to her ancestral memories seeking a second chance, at her expense. She managed to silence them thanks to Bene Gesserit litanies and [[Zensunni/DE|Zensunni]] rituals (which she knew from Fremen memories), but they grew stronger over time time as did the heavy doses of melange she used to take. Her decisions were harsh and her "divine rages" were infamous to her aides. She ignored the advice of Idaho, and those closest to her to spare herself more.

The strain against the maddening internal voices finally became too great and to avoid fragmentation of her personality, in 10217 AG she made an alliance with the strong memory of Vladimir Harkonnen. Both strong personalities acting in concert they managed to shut out the voices. Around that time she started Bene Gesserit techniques to maintain her young body.

However the influence of Harkonnen corrupted her mind, resulting to a different way of decisions and actions, becoming more self-protective and less representative of the old Atreides codes. Alerted by the change, the Sisterhood sent a delegation to Caladan, asking the help from Lady Jessica to investigating her daughter. Jessica knew that the purpose of her Sisters would be to destroy the Abomination, so she accepted to help Alia to save herself. Soon after she arrived to Arrakeen, Jessica was a captive of [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]] and Alia expanded her control of the [[Imperium/DE|Imperium]]: Leto was presumed dead, and Ghanima who would ascend the throne, was to be engaged to [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Farad'n Corrino]].

Jessica, Leto, Ghanima, Farad'n, even Idaho and [[Gurney Halleck/DE|Halleck]] planned against her in 10220 AG. Alia put an assassin against Halleck, but when the attempt failed, she took greater risks. Idaho's death forced Stilgar to flee to the desert with Irulan and Ghanima. Her ally spent more time lusting after the young men in her court than he did helping her.

[[Zia]] brought to her [[Buer Agarves/DE|Buer Agarves]] as her new aide who would later replace [[Javid]] as Alia's plaything in bed. Early in his service, Alia sent them to [[Sietch Tabr/DE|Sietch Tabr]] with messages, and Agarves returned reporting that [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]] had killed Idaho after Idaho had killed Javid. Agarves lied that he was not present, fearing for Alia's reprisals if he admitted that he did nothing to protect them. Alia commanded him to kill Stilgar promising him to become Naib of Tabr. During one of his reports, Alia lied that that her initial command was a result of ravaging grief but now she had forgiven him and only wanted Stilgar to return to Sietch Tabr; Alia also gave him as a parting gift new boots, where a transmitter was secreted. The transmitter let Alia's forces to Stilgar's refuge, and Agarves' death.<ref>Buer Agarves</ref>

She secured Irulan and Stilgar in her dungeons and even persuaded Ghanima to accept Farad'n. But she had spread her forces too thin.

===Death===
[[File:Leto's Return|thumb|left|Leto's return and Alia's suicide. ]]

Leto was now protected and strengthened by his [[sandtrout/DE|sandtrout]] skin, arrived at Alia's Temple and could overcome her legendary prowess at hand-to-hand combat. Defeated, Alia exerted the force of her own personality one final time. In spite of the protests of her inner voices, she took her own life rather than to submit to a Fremen Trial of Possession. As she flung herself to the Temple courtyard, she performed her first independent act in years.

Her body was removed from the courtyard and processed through the nearest [[deathstill]]; the water was carried into the desert to evaporate in the fierce sun, a Fremen way of disposing with the water of one convicted of Possession, and indicative of the low opinion held of her by that time.

==Character==
From her youth, Alia chose isolation, and as she grew older, Alia often mentioned her loneliness from the rest of humanity, increasingly blaming her mother for this condition. In certain aspects, she surpassed her brother. Jessica understood what had happened to her daughter as best as she could (for someone who had not experienced such an awakening) but could provide only little comfort.<ref name=alia/> Whenever her presence was not commanded, she absented from the Court; as a Regent she was mostly unavailable except for official duties.

Lacking her brother's prescient abilities, Alia indulged in massive doses of melange to broaden her vision although the spice-trance most often failed her. Her heavy melange consumption was just another means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors.

She ruled as a power-hungry woman, aided by the memories of ambitious and greedy rulers, and most of her actions had the aim to solidify her position, such as her marriage, and manipulation of her nephews.<ref name=abomination/>

Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with Fremen was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.

==Legacy==
After her water was poured into the sand, her family seldom spoke about her, but Ghanima told her children about the pains of being human and in contact with their past.<ref name=ghanima/>

Princess Irulan, one of a number of Bene Gesserit spies who were introduced into Muad'Dib's household posing as retainers, was close to the Lady Alia even into her Regency and even until her death. Their observations, along with those of various Reverend Mothers who came into contact with her, provided the basis for the [[Report on Alia Atreides]], after which the Bene Gesserit Judiciary Council condemned Alia as an "Abomination to be Abhorred" in 10211 AG. The authors (Sisters) of the final draft of the Report after Alia's death unanimously declared that Alia wilfully chose Abomination's way for herself, spurning all attempts to save her humanity. Her suicide relieved the Sisterhood.<ref name=abomination>Alia as Abomination</ref>

The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. While worshipped during her life, as a reflected image of Muad'Dib, carrying on his work, after her death she was worshipped as a divine godhead of her own. Her title as "The Womb of Heaven" was adopted by the Cults as a far more hallowed connotation (her lesser titles were discarded). The first recorded [[Cult of Alia]] was established in Arrakeen in 10970 AG during the rule of Leto, with [[The Book of Alia]] dedicated to her divinity.

In ''[[The Dune Catastrophe]]'', [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Harq al-Ada]] makes the very point that Alia was capable of encompassing each of the contradictory personalities with which she has been credited, citing the opinion of Ghanima Atreides: "My aunt chose her own course at many junctures, but the opportunity to choose was not always given her. Leto and I pitied her even as we feared her, and I believe that she often felt the same mix of emotions toward herself."<ref name=alia/>

[[Bronso of Ix]], in the ''[[Atreides Imperium]]'', dismisses Alia as "a self-made disaster". A similar opinion is held by [[Lors Karden]] author of the ''[[Truth and Fancy in the Oral History]]''.<ref name=abomination/>

Rothar
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Seli,.jpeg|thumb]]

'''Rothar''' was a [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] and the first wormrider.

In [[7265 AG]] Rothar was in a party investigating a new spicesand when a large [[sandworm/DE|Sandworm]] appeared nearby. His peers scrambled to the safety of a nearby outcropping of rocks before the worm drew too near. Rothar, evidently too stunned by the worm's arrival to move, found himself only centimeters from the creature's side as it rose from the sand; he seized the leading edge of one
of the worm's ring segments and held on tightly, perhaps in an attempt to avoid the worm's flashing teeth.

The sandworm rolled quickly, raising the segment the young Fremen had opened high above the surface of the sand (thereby putting
Rothar on top of its body, as well). It then sped off into the desert, with Rothar as passenger.

Within days, the first crude [[maker hooks/DE|maker hooks]] (designed to catch and hold open the edge of a worm's skin segments) had been fashioned and volunteers from every [[sietch/DE|sietch]] were becoming sandriders. 

Refined techniques were discovered with the price of many lives of the earliest practitioners who were killed in the attempt; but within another generation the Fremen's means of travel was firmly established.

==Notes==

The [[Prelude to Dune]] Books by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] name a very similar character [[Selim Wormrider]].

Harah
{{Mixed}}

'''Harah''' was the [[Fremen]] wife by custom of [[Paul Atreides]]; widow of [[Jamis]]; nurse of [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], and [[Ghanima Atreides]]; wife of [[Stilgar]]. Harah's maternal impulse drove her to lavish solicitude not only on her own children but on those of the [[House Atreides|Atreides Family]] as well.

==Life Before the Atreides==
Records recount that Harah was won by [[Geoff]]. However, the placidity of her life with Geoff was disturbed when he was challenged by Jamis, a challenge which ended in Geoff's demise and in Jamis taking Harah as his woman.

As Jamis' wife, as a desert fighter par excellence, and as the mother of [[Kaleff]] (by Geoff) and [[Orlop]] (by Jamis), Harah found the tempo of her life quickening. The greater portion of her days was spent in the [[stillsuit shops]] or the [[planting areas]], but she devoted much time to rearing her sons and creating the home she wanted for Jamis when he returned from his forays or patrols. It would appear that Harah recounted her years with Jamis as good years, full of achievement and family happiness. This domestic peace would have been shattered, however, when news reached [[Sietch Tabr]] of Jamis' death at the [[Cave of Ridges]]. Bred as a Fremen, she met the news as a Fremen: her innate resilience allowed her to meet and accept what destiny had next in store for her.

==Service to the Atreides==
By law, Jamis' [[yali]] and all his possessions, excluding the funeral gifts but including his wife and sons, belonged to [[Paul Atreides|Paul Muad'Dib]] who was [[Usul]], the boy who had dispatched Jamis in the [[Tahaddi Challenge]]. Thus, Harah became Paul's for one year, to take as wife or servant, after which time she would be free to choose as she wished. Over Harah's objections, Paul accepted her as servant. Although her pride was hurt by Paul's rejection of her charms, Harah set aside her vanity with a practicality that surprised Paul and devoted herself to serving him as one she respected and came to love. Her content was augmented when the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] asked her to be the infant Alia's nurse.

Some time after Paul and Jessica came to Sietch Tabr, Paul took [[Chani Kynes|Chani]] as his concubine. When the women and children of the sietch were forced to flee the pogrom of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] governor, Harah went with them as an honored member of Paul's household. Though lonely in exile, Harah busied herself as Alia's guardian and governess. Trying to control a child like Alia would have been a frustrating job, made more difficult by Alia's knowing and speaking of things beyond her years and by flouting traditional modes of behavior. But Harah's devotion to Alia was unflagging, defending her against the rumours and unkind words of the other women of the sietch, who were afraid of Alia. In return, Alia gave her love to Harah openly. Indeed, Alia's first words to her nurse were "I love you, Harah."

Besides raising Alia and becoming indispensable to her husband Stilgar in the years that followed Paul's ascendance to the emperor's throne, Harah became Chani's closest female friend. As Chani's intimate she stood at the side of her friend when she gave birth to the Atreides twins, Leto and Ghanima, and watched stone-faced as Chani died. It was her terrible duty to guide the now completely blind Paul Muad'Dib first to the creche that held his children and then to the pallet that held Chani's body. Harah was able to perform her last duty for her friend: to be observer of the holy truth and stand beside Chani for the last time at the [[deathstill]].

At Paul's request, Harah, as a friend of the mother, also stood beside Paul at the time of the naming of his son Leto for his paternal grandfather, and of his daughter Ghanima — over Harah's understandable objections (in Fremen 'ghanima' meant a spoil of war). With Chani dead and Paul apparently swallowed by the desert, Harah felt destiny had once more called her to play the role in which she excelled: the Atreides twins needed a mother. But the joy was tempered by disquiet, for these children were much as Alia had been: exasperating, unsettling, and sometimes terrifying. However, with her Fremen background, her sagacity, and her experience with Alia, she proved to be a match for the precocious twins. Coming to love the twins as her own, Harah was devastated by the news that Leto had fallen victim to [[Laza tiger]]s. She consoled herself by trying to console Ghanima; to ease the pain Harah applied herself to providing Stilgar with every comfort. She gave minute attention to his wardrobe and yali, supervising even the smallest housekeeping detail — preparing coffee, for example, just as Stilgar preferred it: grinding fresh roasted beans to a fine powder in a stone mortar, then boiling immediately with a pinch of [[spice melange|melange]].

But once again the evenness of her days was shattered by a crisis: early one morning Stilgar called her to view the dead bodies of [[Javid]] and, unbelievably, [[Duncan Idaho]] and to tell her that he had sent [[Buer Agarves]] to Alia with his "final obedience." But the abductors Agarves had unwittingly led to the djedida overwhelmed the fugitives and carried them off to Arrakis and Alia's prison cells. While not present in Alia's quarters in the Keep on that disastrous day when House Atreides established its millennial dynasty, Harah heard the terrible news soon enough: the death of Paul ([[The Preacher]]), the suicide of Alia, the seduction of [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]], the metamorphosis of Leto.

== Appearance ==

Harah was a woman  with eyes of dense darkness, black hair,a high forehead, sharp cheekbones, an aquiline nose and pale olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp features of her angular facial features, seeming old for her age.

==Behind the Scenes==
It was likely that Alia's death preceded by her transformation into true "Abomination," diminished Harah. That strong maternal drive that defined her existence for so many years was likely to have been struck a mortal blow. Presumably, Harah lived into old age.

In Greek, the word ''"Harah"'' means "Joy". However, in Arabic, the language from which so many Fremen terms originate, it might come from the word "Hurra" which means "Free" or the arabic name "Harra".It may also be possible that he was thinking of the Hebrew word ''"harah"'' meaning "pregnant".

In the 1984 ''Dune'' movie, Harah was portrayed by actress Molly Wryn. However, her scenes were cut from the theatrical release of the film. She did not appear and was not mentioned in the 2000 or 2003 miniseries.

'''Naib Stilgar''' was a [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] who was the [[Naib]] of [[Sietch]] [[Sietch Tabr|Tabr]] and the Governor of [[Arrakis]] from 10196 AG onwards. He was a close friend and chief advisor to [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and with Kynes {{C|10140s-10191}} ===
Stilgar was born in [[Red Wall Sietch]]; he was the brother of [[Frieth]]. By the year [[10154 AG/XD|10154 AG]], he was a young man and good friends with [[Turok]] and [[Ommun]].  This year he and his friends were saved by [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] from bullying [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnen]] bravos. The act resulted in a lifelong friendship and in Stilgar adopting Kynes' dream of transforming Arrakis into a clement and green planet along with the other Fremen. By [[10166 AG]], Stilgar, Turok and Ommun had become the Planetologist's most loyal and devoted guerilla lieutenants. They had also become the secondary leaders under Kynes of the many Fremen sietches who had joined the plan to terraform Arrakis by [[10170 AG]]. 

Stilgar himself brought the news of Pardot's death in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] to his nineteen-year-old son [[Liet-Kynes/XD|Liet-Kynes]] in [[10174 AG]]. In the years following this event Stilgar developed an equally close relationship with Liet, the new Planetologist. Stilgar led a raid on [[Hadith Sietch]] in [[10175 AG/XD|10175 AG]]. Stilgar became Naib of Sietch Tabr later in the year when he [[call out|called out]] and defeated the existing Naib. He went on to establish himself as one of the most respected and fearsome Fremen.

=== Desert War {{C|10191-10193}} ===

==== Change of fief ====
Upon the change of the Arrakis fief in [[10191 AG]] from [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] to [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]], Stilgar was befriended by Atreides [[Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], who had been sent in advance by [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Duke Leto Atreides]] to gauge and study the Fremen. In Idaho's reports to Leto, Idaho had judged Stilgar to be a 'good example' of the Fremen of Arrakis. Indeed, through Idaho's relationship with Stilgar and his tribe, he became so impressed with the Fremen and their ways that Idaho accepted dual loyalties to the Atreides and to Stilgar.

====Open war====
After House Harkonnen [[Siege of Arrakeen|attacked]] Arrakis and House Atreides went renegade, beginning the [[Desert War]], the remaining members of the Atreides family, namely the Ducal heir [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]], sought refuge with Stilgar and his tribe, who spared them after trying to take their water and being bested. Stilgar soon became a good friend of Paul's. However, over time, as Paul developed his [[prescience|prescient]] powers, Stilgar became more of a religious follower. As the War reached it's climax, Stilgar fought during the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]], after which Paul became Emperor and Stilgar was granted the stewardship of Arrakis.

=== Muad'Dib's Jihad {{C|10193-10205}} ===

====Sack of Kaitain====
In [[10194/XD|10194 AG]], Stilgar led the forces of [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's loose Jihad]] on [[Sack of Kaitain|the sack]] of the former Corrino capital world of [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]]. The world fell easily to Stilgar and his [[Fedaykin]] forces, as [[Elias]] and other troops, ransacked the buildings of [[Corrinth City]]. As the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] gutted the [[Imperial Opal Palace]], the [[Imperial Necropolis]], and destroyed countless museums, members of the [[Landsraad]] became concerned about the Dune-warriors sensibilities.

Paul arrived on Kaitain in [[10196 AG/XD|10196 AG]] to address the Landsraad for the first time since assuming the Royal Throne, the Emperor explained that the destruction of Kaitain was the true ending of the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]]. Stilgar listened behind Paul, as many of the nobles fell into line behind [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. Others, such as [[Earl]] [[Memnon Thorvald]], of [[House Thorvald]], had witnessed the sack of Kaitain firsthand, stormed out of the Assembly, to foment a rebellion.

====Near-Death on Jericha====
Stilgar led many battles throughout the [[Atreides Empire]] for [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]], but later in the year of 10196, Stilgar had a life-changing experience on the planet [[Jericha]]. As Stilgar led [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Jihadi]] troops against the rebel guerilla forces of Earl Memnon Thorvald; the Atreides' commander, [[Burbage]], had warned Stilgar of attacking Thorvald's forces in the mountains in a frontal assault, and told Stilgar to attack in stealth.

Stilgar ignored the warnings of Burbage and attacked first with [[ornithopter]]s and other air craft. The forces of Thorvald were arrayed in the mountains and had [[suspensor]]-suppressing equipment, which casued all of the aircraft to crash. Still committed to a forceful attack, Stilgar and the Jihadi forces had to confiscate [[ruh-yak]]s from the local Jericha townsfolk, and make a dangerous journey up into the hill country. As the ruh-yaks crossed over the river, Stilgar and his Fremen, began to panic, and some started to drown. As Stilgar had a near-death experience as the river water filled his lungs, Burbage lifted him out of the water, and began pumping his lungs, and saved his life. Stilgar decided to retire to Arrakis, and become Paul's chief advisor.

=== Later life {{C|10205-10217}} ===
In [[10205 AG]], at the end of Paul's Jihad, Stilgar helped him settle the [[Tupile Treaty]] and the matter of the [[Ixian Confederacy]]. In [[10207 AG/XD|10207 AG]], when Paul walked into the desert, blind, Stilgar executed the [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Korba/XD|Korba the Panegyrist]] and the Guild [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], disobeying Paul's prior orders against this. A few months later, Stilgar and Jessica secretly agreed to take the water of Paul's concubine [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]], who had died in childbirth, for safekeeping while the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]] was engrossed in her search for the rebel [[Bronso of Ix/XD|Bronso Vernius]] of [[Ix/XD|Ix]] and his associates.

In [[10219 AG|10217 AG]], later in the regency of Alia, who had become possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], Stilgar declared Sietch Tabr neutral in the war between the allies of the Lady Jessica and her grandchildren and Alia. However, he killed the Duncan Idaho ghola (Hayt) who was Alia's wife, after Duncan killed [[Javid]], violating sanctuary, and so was forced to turn against the Regent. After this, he was instrumental in allying the Fremen tribes with the allies of Jessica. Upon the ascension of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] not long after, Stilgar thought of a time earlier in the year when he thought of slaying Leto while he was sleeping, and privately noted that it was now 'too late'.  

===Legacy===
Stilgar lived a long and prestigious life, thanks in no small part to his diet of [[Spice Melange/XD|melange]], a pervasive ingredient in all Fremen food and drink. Stilgar's descendants flourished well into the reign of Leto II the [[God-Emperor]], and probably beyond.

He wrote a preface for the book ''"Muad'Dib, The Man"'' for the Princess [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan]].

=== Ghola during Kralizec ===
Stilgra  was one of the first historical figures reborn as part of [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]]'s ghola project aboard the [[No-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]''. His ''[[Ghola/XD|ghola]]'' grew up on the vessel, and formed a close bond with the ghola of his former friend, Liet-Kynes. Stilgar's memories were successfully restored through a recreation of his near-death experience on Jericha.

After a decade of wandering, the no-ship found the planet [[Qelso]], which was slowly being converted to a desert by [[Sandworm/XD|sandworms]] seeded previously by the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]]. Stilgar and Kynes stayed behind to help a group of natives both slow the advance of the desert, but prepare for the inevitable aridity of the world. Later, following [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]'s merging with the independent robot [[Erasmus]], Duncan returned to Qelso with an army of [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machines]] to halt the spread of the desert.

== Behind the Scenes ==
Stilgar was played by Everett McGill in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 Dune movie]]; by Uwe Ochsenknecht in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 Dune miniseries]]; and by Steven Berkoff in the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]].

Chani Kynes/DE
[[File:Chani_bw.png|thumb]]Lady '''Chani Atreides''', born as '''Chani Kynes''', was the [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] daughter of [[Liet Kynes]] and mate of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]]. She died giving birth to [[Leto Atreides II/DE|Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima Atreides.]]
==Biography==
===Early life===
Chani was born in 10177 in [[Sietch Tabr/DE|Sietch Tabr]], the daughter of the secret leader of Liet Kynes and [[Falra|Faroula]]. [[Stilgar]] and his wife [[Misra]] stood as her godparents and performed the [[Water of Conception]] ritual for her.

Her father was mostly out, and sometimes had to steal some days from his work at the palmaries to visit her. Her father occasionally took her to the planting sites and tutored her about his work. He was very proud of her quick intellect. Liet however did not wish for Chani to inherit him as an Imperial servant and have a double life like him, and decided that she'd live entirely as a Fremen.

Chani was raised mostly by [[Falra|Faroula]], with some assistance from Misra and the other woman. She was only 3 years old when Falra was killed in a rockslide and Chani was taken into Stilgar's household and soon became a part of the Naib's family. She attended the spirit-releasing ceremony without weeping.

By the age of 5 Chani was helping at the sietch gardens, captured [[sandtrout/DE|sandtrout]] for the [[deathstill]], or dispatched enemy wounded after battles. Later she learned to perform occupation she would be required to now as an adult, like weaving, to making coffee, making and mending [[Stillsuit|stillsuit.]]

Chani was in a small group of girls in their puberty who retreated with [[Reverend Mother/DE|Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]]. On their last day the group went on a ''[[hajra]]'' to one of the tribal holding basins. They seated around Ramallo, altered a small quantity of the [[Water of Life/DE|Water of Life]] and bid each of them drink from it. Then, as the girls entered the drug-induced trance, Ramallo told them that the basin held the future life of their people, and each of them held a small portion of that in their bodies. The talk relaxed them, as their minds pondered the future of their tribe, and Ramallo (already in an advanced age and without an apprentice) probed for the one who would take her place, and it was Chani who demonstrated the most necessary traits: compassion, intelligence and courage, conscious of her own mortality while discounting it for their people. Chani was initiated in the following tribal assembly, and returned to Tabr three months before the war that erupted on Arrakis.
===Meeting Paul===
Stilgar had received an order from Liet-Kynes to take a band out into the desert with Chani along as part of the group in search of Paul Atreides and his mother, the BG [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Lady Jessica]] and messages sent back to the sietch by the [[Shadout Mapes/DE]] had indicated that Jessica might be something more. Ramallo seconded that decision and wished to hear Chani's impressions of the encounter. Chani was filled with wonder by the murmurings that her son was the [[Lisan al-gaib]], but she was more impressed by the out-freyn Sayyadina, who had bested Stilgar in single combat using her [[weirding way]]s. The hot-tempered [[Jamis]] challenged Jessica's part in the legend and Paul killed him with a knife, without receiving a scratch, proving he is not a soft outworlder. 

Ramallo did not survive long enough for Chani to succeed her and Jessica "passed within" to become a Reverend Mother and taking Ramallo's place and had converted the [[Water of Life/DE]] for the tribe, distributing it among them to induce the [[spice orgy]]. Sensitive to the wishes of the others, who wished to enjoy their communion without the discordant note of Usul's alien mind, she drew Usul away. The two of them retreated to her private quarters, scarcely feeling the presence of the rest of the tribe. She reminded him that they both lost their fathers to the [[House Harkonnen/DE|Harkonnens]], and Paul shared his visions with her in the spice-trance. The two became inseparably joined.

In the following months Usul had to learn the Fremen ways and adapt. Chani was the [[Sayyadina]] of the Rite when Usul became a [[sandrider]], and observed in fright the struggle between him and Stilgar. She rejoiced in the legend and power growing around him, exulting in his victories, while she herself killed any challengers she considered unworthy of facing him, adding to his status despite Jessica's misgivings concerning their "marriage of youth". She gave birth to [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|Leto Atreides II the Elder,]] named in honor of the martyred Duke. 

The most frightening moment was after Paul's three-week sleep in the Waters of Life. When Chani came to revive him shetested his reaction to the illuminating poison in its raw state (something that Jessica had not thought to try). In the final battle for Arrakis in 10193, the boy Leto was killed, something that broke her after withstanding so many deaths. Paul Atreides wrested control of the planet and forced the abdication of [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]], but Chani took no joy in the victory and could take comfort only from Paul's presence. He knew about his death already when Chani came to brought him the news.

===Atreides Reign===
Chani spent the following three years in negotiations preceding Paul's formal acceptance by the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]] and the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]] as an assistant to Lady Jessica in bargaining with the deposed emperor. As his Royal Concubine they had practiced contraception in the Fremen way during the years when his full attention was required for the negotiations. She must have won many of the concessions during endless round of talks, resulting to Jessica often saying, that she hoped never to have to negotiate any kind of terms against a Fremen  since their ferocity in battle paled before their determination at a conference table.

During this period five attempts were made on her life. Once, the assassin managed to infiltrate her apartments but he did not succeed in his aim and Chani managed to dispatch him with her [[crysknife]]. She burst into the Council Chamber, her robe stained with her assailant's blood and her hand poised on the sheathed crysknife's handle. Jessica — as Chani had anticipated — focused her attention on Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]], soon to be Paul's Consort-in-name. She was genuinely stunned, and a brief expression of surprised delight escaped her (as she had been angered by her secondary place) before her Bene Gesserit training could conceal it, convincing Jessica of her innocence.

Paul's reign was officialized in 10196 and for the next twelve years Chani served him as wife, companion, and advisor. They tried for a royal heir,  but as Irulan was administering her a potent contraceptive drug through her food, Chani could not conceive. Her continued childlessness caused her great pain. In spite of revulsion at the thought of Paul's making Irulan his wife-in-fact, Chani was so distressed by her inability to provide an heir for House Atreides that she at last suggested that he allow Irulan to have her chance as the only logical source for progeny. This suggestion made Paul at first angry and suspicious that Irulan might have used Chani to advance her schemes for power, and told her that Irulan was too dangerous and her position would be secured. 
===Pregnacy===
Chani was convinced that the Imperial physicians could be of no further help, and reverted to the Fremen traditions; after praying and consulting older women from among the tribes, she embarked on a special diet that was supposed to promote fertility. A trusted friend from Tabr brought to her the ingredients and Chani prepared her meals, not allowing anyone else to touch the food. Within weeks, Chani was pregnant, but during her first session with the doctors traces of the contraceptive were found in her system, now being cleared by the new regimen. Long-term ingestion of the contraceptive, interacting with the [[spice/DE|melange]], had harmed Chani: from the moment the twin fetuses occupied her womb, her metabolism had sped up to a terrifying rate and had to eat 3-4 times her ordinary food along with increasingly larger doses of the spice. The interactions of the contraceptive and the increased intake of the melange accelerated the pregnancy; the children would be born in less than six months, assuming she would survive.

Usul asked her to spare the Princess, but nothing could calm Chani's hatred toward her. During the rest of her pregnancy a fog surrounded her, limiting her vision until she could see only as far ahead as the birth. In her preoccupation with it, Chani was affected (as from a distance) by external problems, like the plot against the emperor, Paul's blindness in the wake of the stonebumer attack. She could not be certain even of what she was feeling among her fast changing emotions, or why. She snapped at Paul for wearing a shabby old jacket, and having been told that "even an emperor has his favorite clothing" she found herself giving water to the dead. She once told Paul that her life would have to begin again from the day of labour, and his silence only added to her confusion.

As she was sure he would, Paul returned with her to Tabr for the children to be born. When she was conversing with the ghola of [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]], on a spot she chose for a look out over the desert, the moment came, and with his guidance she made it back into the sietch. Her last thought, was that she was unsure if Usul knew she carried twins, and before she abandoned herself to the pains of labor. Less than an hour after the onset of contractions, calling for her Usul, Chani died giving birth to their son and daughter. 
===Death===
[[Scytale]], the [[face dancer]], prospected pf restoring her as a [[ghola]] and bargained with [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]] then Paul who killed him. [[Bijaz]] made the same offer until Duncan Idaho slew him, putting his master out of temptation's reach, and her body was taken to the [[deathstill]].

Even Irulan joined at the ceremony held that evening to release her spirit, astonishing the friends of Chani, triggering muttering and anger since it was believed that she would defile the ritual. When her turn came, she walked to the pile of Chani's belongings heaped on the cavern floor, picked up a small stone pendant and said that noble character and noble birth are different things. In [[Fremen language]] she concluded "''Ish yara al-ahdab hadbat-u''" (a hunchback does not see his own hunch). It was the first sign of Irulan's defection from the Bene Gesserit before becoming one of the adults responsible for raising Paul's and Chani's twins.

The '''Fremen''' were a sub-culture of [[human]]s descended from the [[Zensunni Wanderers]] who considered the planet [[Arrakis]] their home. They formed an integral part in the establishment of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] launched by [[Paul Atreides]], their adopted leader.

== History  ==
Despite their keen sense of oral history, the history of the Fremen prior to their arrival on [[Arrakis]] was distorted and partially lost over the millennia. They concluded that [[Arrakis]] was the final stop on the migration of the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], a journey that they mistakenly believed started on the planet [[Poritrin]].

In the [[Standard Year]] 10,191 [[A.G.]], Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] ordered [[House Atreides]] to replace their enemies [[House Harkonnen]] in the administration of Arrakis. Upon arrival on Arrakis, House Atreides, lead by Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] sought to befriend the Fremen. However, because of years of harsh Harkonnen rule and dealings with Imperial agents, the Fremen were at first distrustful of the Atreides. After a short while however, the Fremen came to develop a relationship with the Duke through his even-handedness and generosity. Moreover, the Duke sent his [[Warmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]] as an ambassador. Through Duncan's abilities as a warrior the Atreides managed to gain the trust of the Fremen, and the Duke quickly learned that the Fremen were a powerful force with which to align his House. However, when the Harkonnens and Corrinos invaded Arrakis, House Atreides went renegade and sought refuge with the Fremen.
After their adoption of the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the Fremen saw a rapid and dramatic change in their fortunes. Upon determining that [[Paul Atreides]] was their [[Mahdi]] - or prophetic savior - they readily followed his leadership and engaged in guerilla warfare against [[Imperium|Imperial]] elements on [[Arrakis]]. The Fremen had developed such formidable fighting abilities through years of surviving both the harsh environment and attrition wars against the Harkonnens that they were deemed superior even to the Corrino [[Sardaukar]] forces. Within a few years they had gone from being perpetually harassed by elements within the [[Corrino Empire]] (most notably [[House Harkonnen]]) to being the foot soldiers of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Paul Atreides]] powerful jihad. In twelve Standard Years the Fremen overran the Imperium.

===Museum Fremen===

From the time of the [[God-Emperor]] onwards the cultural impact of the Fremen ebbed, thanks in no small part to the terraforming of [[Arrakis]]. By the time of the God Emperor's death, the Fremen were relegated to being no more than 'museum' pieces, their ancient and purposeful traditions diluted into honorary forms without meaning. After [[The Scattering]] and during the time of the [[Honored Matres]], the Fremen possessed little of the distinct identity of their past, although a few individuals, such as [[Sheeana]], continued to adhere to some of the old Fremen attitudes and traditions.

It is believed that most, if not all of the Fremen (excluding Sheanna) were killed during the Honored Matre attack on Rakis that essentially destroyed the planet, approximately 1500 Standard Years after Leto II's death.

== Culture ==
To the Fremen, the fight for survival had long dominated their cultural identity. The brutal environment of [[Arrakis]] necessitated the frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. Additionally, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of [[Arrakis]] to fend off off-world opponents who often possessed far superior technology and formal training. 

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal collectives, known as [[sietch]]es, which were led by a [[Naib]]. Each sietch resides within one of the numerous rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood. Polygamy was commonplace in Fremen society, with more prominent men having several wives and children with each of them. Also integral to their community was their [[Reverend Mother]], who was created after drinking the [[water of life]] and sharing the regurgitated bile with her sietch members.

Water was a central part of Fremen culture. Indeed, for Fremen, water ''was'' life. To conserve against the unnecessary loss of water in the desert, Fremen wore complex full-body filtration systems called [[stillsuit]]s, which reclaimed the body's moisture. Additionally, specialized headgear prevented most of the normal loss through the scalp and forehead via perspiration, while masks and noseplugs reclaimed moisture from the wearers' breathing. Gloves were also available, too, but many Fremen opted instead to rub the juice of the [[creosote bush]] on their hands to inhibit perspiration. With a Fremen stillsuit in proper working order, the wearer lost only about a thimbleful of water per day.

The Fremen rule was that one's water belongs to the tribe. Thus when a Fremen died or was killed in combat, rather than being buried or cremated, he or she was rendered down into water. In the case of ''[[amtal]]'', or ritual combat to the death between two disagreeing Fremen, since they fought without stillsuits, the water of the loser went to the victor to replenish him. What remained was measured and allocated to him, but the water itself was turned over to the watermasters.

== Appearance ==
Due to living on [[Arrakis]], the typical Fremen appeared as a sinewy [[human]] with leathery tanned skin. These effects were less pronounced on those Fremen who live in cities such as [[Arrakeen]]. In addition, Fremen eyes were colored entirely blue ("[[Eyes of Ibad]]"), due to their excessive ingestion of the [[Spice Melange]].

== Religion ==
{{Stub}}{{Religion infobox|name=Fremen religion|headquarters=[[Arrakis]]|theology=Monotheism/Polytheism|deities=*[[Shai-Hulud]]|collapse=Gradually in the years following [[10219 AG]]}}
Religiously, the Fremen were deeply spiritual, to the point of being superstitious. Before the coming of Muad'Dib, the Fremen of Arrakis practiced a religion whose roots in the [[Maometh Saari]] were there for any scholar to see. Many also traced the extensive borrowings from other religions. The most common example was the [[Hymn to Water]], a direct copy from the [[Orange Catholic Liturgical Manual]], calling for rain clouds which Arrakis had never seen. But there were more profound points of accord between the Kitab al-Ibar of the Fremen and the teachings of Bible, Ilm, and Fiqh.

Over the centuries the Fremen had adapted their blend of [[Zensunni]] faith to their desert environment, and adopted the [[sandworm]] of [[Arrakis]] (or [[Shai-Hulud]] as they called it) as a physical manifestation of a [[God]]. This, combined with the sparse natural resources on [[Arrakis]] led to the [[Spice Melange]] becoming an integral part of their diet and culture. As with many traditionalist and mystic [[religion]]s, the faith of the Fremen relied heavily on prophecies. These beliefs were used by some, including the [[Bene Gesserit]] to further their own ends.

== Behind the Scenes ==
Though further details are not chronicled by [[Frank Herbert]], the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] give a detailed explanation of how the Fremen came into being. In these novels they are an amalgamation of at least two separate groups: the Zenshi'a, who came during the rise of the Evermind or possibly during the Time of the Titans, and the Zensunni, who arrived during Butlerian Jihad after events on Poritrin led to the second slave uprising. Both fled to [[Arrakis]] to escape slavery brought on by the harsh reaction of the free humans to the Buddaislamics refusal to fight the thinking machines as they further encroached on humanity.

Fremen/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Fremen}}{{Cleanup}}{{Stub}}[[Image:Fremen (1984 Dune film).jpg|thumb|right|Fremen in stilsuits, from the 1984 Dune movie.]]

The '''Fremen''', originally known as the '''Free Men of Arrakis''' or '''Free Men of Dune''' and later the '''Freemen of Dune''', were a sub-culture of [[human]]s descended from the [[Zensunni Wanderers]] who considered the planet [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] their home. They formed an integral part in the establishment of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] launched by [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], their adopted leader.

== History ==

[[File:Dune-ccg-judge-of-the-change-fakhir-zirut-56s_519rFydJQTL-1.jpg|thumb]]

The origins of the Fremen lay with the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], who fled from one planet to another prior to The [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]], escaping religious and cultural persecution. Several [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] settled on Arrakis, as they fled from the upcoming war initiated by the [[Titans]]. They thought, this were [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]], the final war in their scriptures and mankind was doomed to lose it. These Zensunni mainly made a living by scavenging the desert for anything that could be sold to the merchants at the spaceport. The worms were considered demons.

Several decades before the war between [[Omnius]] and the [[League of Nobles]] again broke out, with the [[Battle of Zimia|attack]] on [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]], one [[Selim]] was banned from his [[Sietch]], though he was innocent, for a horrible of crime of the stealing of water. From now on, he despised the way of living of the Zensunni. By mistake, he learned to ride a worm and by luck, he found an Old Empire biological research station in the deep desert, that provided him with water. He became Selim Wormrider. He no longer considered the worms as demons, but more as some sort of [[Shai-hulud]], unwilling god. He gathered followers, who also preferred a more spiritually and ascetic life like Selim.

During the war Omnius vs League, a group of [[zensunni/XD|zensunni]] slaves fled [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]] in an [[Spacefolder|experimental spaceship]] and they crashed landed on Arrakis. After an arduous year where nearly half of the original escapees, they mixed with Selim's followers and the leader of the slaves, [[Ishmael]], declared themselves the [[Free Men of Dune|F''ree Men of Arrakis'']]. Later, this was shortended to ''[[Freemen of Dune]]'' in a schism of Free Men which resulted in Ishmael's followers going into the deep desert and others merging with the townfolk of the north pole, leaving their Free Men roots. The ''Freemen'' ultimately became known as ''Fremen''. Despite their keen sense of oral history, the history of the Fremen prior to their arrival on Arrakis was distorted and partially lost over the millennia. They concluded that Arrakis was the final stop on the migration of the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], a journey that they mistakenly believed started on the planet [[Poritrin]].

In [[10191 AG]], Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] ordered [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] to replace their enemies [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] in the administration of Arrakis. Upon arrival on Arrakis, House Atreides, lead by Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto I]] sought to befriend the Fremen. However, because of years of harsh Harkonnen rule and dealings with Imperial agents, the Fremen were at first distrustful of the Atreides.

After a short while however, the Fremen came to develop a relationship with the Duke through his even-handedness and generosity. Moreover, the Duke sent his [[Warmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] as an advance ambassador, and through Duncan's abilities as a warrior the Atreides managed to ellicit the trust of the Fremen, and the Duke quickly learned that the Fremen were a powerful force with which to align his House. However, when the Harkonnens and Corrinos invaded Arrakis, House Atreides went renegade and sought refuge with the Fremen.

After their adoption of the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the Fremen saw a rapid and dramatic change in their fortunes. Upon determining that Paul Atreides was their [[Mahdi]] - or prophetic savior - they readily followed his leadership and engaged in guerilla warfare against the [[Imperium/XD|Imperial]] elements on Arrakis. The Fremen had developed such formidable fighting abilities through years of harsh environment and attrition wars against Harkonnens, that they were deemed superior to even the Corrino [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] forces. Within a few years they had gone from being perpetually harassed by elements within the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino Empire]] (most notably House Harkonnen) to being the foot soldiers of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's powerful Jihad]]. In twelve Standard Years, the Fremen overran the Imperium.

By the time of the God Emperor's death, the Fremen were relegated to being no more than 'museum' pieces, their ancient and purposeful traditions diluted into honorary forms without meaning.

== Behind the scenes ==

* Though further details are not chronicled by [[Frank Herbert]], the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] give a detailed explanation of how the Fremen came into being. In these novels they are an amalgamation of at least two separate groups:  the Zenshi'a, who came during the rise of the Evermind or possibly during the Time of the Titans, and the Zensunni, who arrived during Butlerian Jihad after events on Poritrin led to the second slave uprising. Both fled to Arrakis to escape slavery brought on by the harsh reaction of the free humans to the Buddaislamics refusal to fight the thinking machines as they further encroached on humanity.

Fremen/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Fremen}}{{Stub}}[[File:Fremen_clothing (art by Matt Howarth, The Dune Encyclopedia).png|thumb|Fremen - Illustration by [[Matt Howarth]]]]

The '''Fremen''' were a sub-culture of [[human]]s, the natives of the planet [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], descended from the [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|Zensunni Wanderers]]. They were hard in survival, adapted in the harsh environment of the planet.

They formed an integral part in the establishment of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Fremen Jihad|Muad'Dib's Jihad]] launched by [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]], their adopted leader, after which their life dramatically changed.
==History==
===Origins===
{{main|Wandering Zensunni/DE}}
The Fremen are believed to come from the [[Zensunni/DE|Zensunni]] ultimately considering [[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]] their homeworld.

In [[7193 AG]], all known Zensunni in the Imperium ended their ''[[hajra]]'' when transported to Arrakis. This was organized in deep secret by the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]], when they brought them from [[Ishia]], [[Rossak/DE|Rossak]] and perhaps [[Harmonthep/DE|Harmonthep]]. This served the purposes of both sides: it gave the Zensunni a home on a world where they would be too difficult to dig out. It also gave the Guild a permanent entree to Arrakis and its spice.

The Guild ensured that the Zensunni were established deep enough inside the desert far from those settlers already on Arrakis (concentrated chiefly in [[Arrakeen/DE|Arrakeen]], the seat of government). From that point on, the Zensunni recognized themselves not as a religion but as a people, and they called themselves "Fremen". 

===During Muad'dib===
Then, while villages and cities grew and water resources increased, the discipline that marked Fremen society was forgotten and individualism became socially accepted. [[Leto II Atreides]] imposed restrictive policies, empasizing learning only agricultural skills in his pastoral empire. He also cut communications and interstellar travel to provide a feudal piece. 

Eventually the Fremen grew soft and more isolated from each other, with less enemies. Once the struggle for survival was removed, they lost their will to live.

In [[12758 AG]] Leto II declared them an endangered population and his [[Fish Speakers]] moved them to the [[Fremen Museum]] which replicated the ancient sietch ways. Leto treated them as his playthings, nurturing them but while constraining the scope of their lives.

==Appearance==
[[File:Fremen clothing.png|thumb|Examples of Fremen attires.]]
Casual clothing favored tones of yellow, green, blue, crimson for trouser and jerkin. Formal clothing required a black/buff cloak of [[merino]] wool. Women tended to choose earth tones, sand-color or beige. They wore [[tilsam]]'s or medallions with religious themes. Older men wore chains with rings symbolizing the [[water rings]] they won in battle, and a small turban or scarf.

Men's trousers were made of a merium-weight brocade weave, while women's of a fine cotton (like the expensive sheer cotton from [[Loomar]]). Women wore a ''[[guimlik]]'' and a sheer gown, the ''[[entary]]''. Children wore a ''[[tshka]]'' under the jacket.

In house they wore heelless slippers or boots. Women in dressier occasions wore a high-heeled boot of soft kidskin.

Women also wore water-rings as jewelry at the waist, braided into the hair or as part of a headdress, attached with sheer veil.

Also, Fremen's eyes were blue-within-blue, as an effect of spice addiction.

==Culture==
The Fremen broke away to pursue an ultraconservative way of life  according to the ways of the fathers. During the first days of their exile on Arrakis, they used to sacrifice virgins, a practice that briefly returned during the rule of Leto II Atreides.

Dune was a planet which by nature promoted self-sufficiency and individualism. While farming is a social activity, survival on Dune was depended on hunting and gathering, favoring the strong individual; while a cold climate drives people closer for survival, arid climate means that some survive while others die. In short terms, the necessity of life-and-death decisions does not promote social ties.

Each tribe was commanded by a [[Naib/DE|Naib]] who had absolute authority of life and death. However he could be challenged if his rule was unacceptable.

The core of their society was the ''[[sietch/DE|sietch]]''. Many sietches existed on the planet, and one was capable of containing thousands of people. The sietches did not have a close contact however and each individual did not care about how many other sietches besides his, existed. 

Fremen lived on simple fare. [[Kulon]]s carried the family's belongings. They rose at sunset and slept at dawn.<ref>This is implied in the article FREMEN COOKING, but other articles suggest otherwise.</ref>
===Language===
{{main|Fremen language}}
The Fremen spoke a language descendant of the Arabic of [[Terra]]. They were highly conservative and believed it to be a treasure that they ought to preserve and it would be a sin to spurn it with other tongues since it preserved the wisdom of the fathers.

===Family===
Fremen children were raised by their individual households and not communally, but every adult in a community accepted some responsibility for their welfare; the nearer relationship to the child's parents, meant greater obligation.<ref name=chani/>Chani Kynes</ref>

Independence was encouraged in all sietch youngsters so that they not burden the tribe. The Fremen had learned centuries earlier that weak, dependent children could jeopardize an entire sietch by demanding time and attention their parents could not spare, while contributing nothing to the tribal welfare.<ref name=chani/>

===Education===
The earliest lessons Fremen children were taught was that wasting water, in any form, was an unpardonable sin, and thus crying was not allowed since it wasted the body's moisture.<ref name=chani/>

A Fremen was educated from childhood till maturity by all members of a sietch in order to maintain the water principle. A way to train and educated their mind and way of thinking was the [[Riddle Game]].

[[Pardot Kynes/DE|Pardot Kynes]] started the first formal sietch schools, dreaming an eco-siociological change and taught about vegetation, snow, rivers, lakes and other things that didn't exist on Arrakis. [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Muad'dib]] during his rule converted their culture to a militaristic and young Fremen started to learn interstellar assault tactics in the [[Arrakeen War College]].

===Nutrition===
The Fremen ate only two meals, a lighter on rising and a heavier at dawn with dessert, like a [[tabara]]. During the night no more food was eaten, except a drink or coffee after a nap.

The donkeys provided them milk, made into butter, cheese and ''[[kvetch]]''. They were provided fruits (dates, figs, apricots, portygul, Caladanian melon) vegetables and nuts from nearby villages. There were also terraform planting areas and high-altitude temperate zones where they could gather some.

Meat ([[desert hare]] and [[chukka]]) was roasted or stewed with root, served on a torn-open flat bread.

Menstruating women followed a special diet which reduced the water level of their bodies, minimizing therefore the water loss and protecting from a dehydration shock.

In [[10169 AG]] [[Sietch Tabr]] was a the place where the first attempts to raise corps with chromoplastic-lined pits, [[dew collector]]s and other means. The first plants to be cultivated were coffee, [[tabaroot]] and vegetables from [[Salusa Secundus/DE|Salusa Secundus]] which lasted for a small harvest in 3 seasons. 

The plantings expanded to other [[sietch]]es and other species of vegetation in secrecy. Dew collectors could help the growths survive for one year with only pollination necessary by humans. Trained children usually cared for these gardens.

Following Arrakis' planetary transformation, crops could be easily raised as on any other world.

===Life cycle===
Minutes after a baby Fremen was born the amniotic fluid was saved and distilled and was then fed to the infant by its godmother (usually one of the mother's best friends) in the presence of a Sayyadina; this feeding was the baby's first, given before it was returned to the mother to nurse. 

As the baby drank, it was the godmother's duty to say to it, ''Here is the water of thy conception''. In this way, the child was seen as having been tied to its parents by the bond of water, as well as being tied, by extension to the rest of the tribe.

Cowards, weaklings, and other such undesirables were never given the opportunity to clutter the gene pool; as further insurance, children born out of wedlock were left in the desert, a sacrifice to Shai-Hulud.

A Fremen was educated from childhood till maturity by all members of a sietch in order to maintain the water principle. A way to train and educated their mind and way of thinking was the [[Riddle Game]]. Education concerning issues such as menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing was considered too vital to be left to the individual parents. At puberty, the girls were taken on a week's retreat (''[[hajra]]'') by the Reverend Mother of their sietch, during which the special functioning of the female stillsuits was explained to them, the ingredients and preparation the moisture-reducing diet during menstruation, the birth-control method of their mate counterparts, and the most reliable means of determining the most fertile days during their cycle.

On their return to the sietch, the young women were welcomed as new adults and received their own ''[[yali]]'' in their parents' households. More responsible tasks were assigned them, and they were considered eligible for marriage. Those selected by their Reverend Mothers during the last day of the retreat were also considered eligible for the Sayyadina.

Young males, or ''[[wali]]'', were those yet to meet another male in mortal combat. Those could not marry since the only men who would father children would be those who had already proven themselves capable of survival. At that, or some other point, the male Fremen was given a [[Fremkit/DE|Fremkit]].<ref>DE p. 251</ref>

A menstruating woman would be put on a sophisticated diet which dramatically decreased the body water level. This not only lessened the amount of moisture available to be lost, but also dropped the level gradually to avoid a sudden shock. Stillsuits for women included a third processing unit for reclaiming the water of blood. Eventually the menstrual cycle gradually lengthened and even leveled off at 56 days. Menopause, was considered a passage nearly as important as puberty. It was customary for a woman's mate, children, and friends to gather for a small party celebrating the safe completion of her fertile years.

When a Fremen died, the body had been run through the [[deathstill]] under the supervision of d Sayyadina and body fluids contained in a bag. A formal memorial service was conducted so that his shade would leave in peace and visit no harm on the tribe at the rising of the sunset on the evening of the death. 

All the members of the sietch would gather around a mound made up of the dead's belongings and water bag. The naib would speak first reminding the others mat the moon rose for their lost comrade and would summon the spirit away that night. He would then declare himself a friend of the deceased, describe a time when he had personally been helped or taught by the dead person, take one item, and claim certain items for the deceased's family and the crysknife, which would be left with the remains in the desert. 

The other members of the tribe would follow the procedure. A Sayyadina came forward last for the water bag to verify its measurement and to turn the [[water rings]] over to the appropriate person.

The tribe then chanted a prayer committing the spirit  and their destinies to Shai Hulud. The sietch watermasters took charge of the bag and poured into the communal basin with the entire tribe serving as witnesses. The dead was honored thus by preserving the living after them survive with their fluids (dishonored members would never be afforded this honor).

The counters for water released by the bodies of Fremen who had died a natural death, or by those of strangers found in the bled who were treated as a water-gift from Shai-Hulud, were consigned to the care of the sietch's Naib and considered held in common by all the people. Those tallying the water once held by enemies killed in group combat were similarly treated.

==Water==
The water was the scarcest and most precious element on Arrakis and it was carefully collected from any source imaginable and consumed carefully. It was considered unlucky to leave free water standing unused unless stored in one of the sietch's evaporation-proof basins.

Every ceremony involving water was conducted or supervised, by a [[Sayyadina/DE|Sayyadina]] (Fremen priestess) initiated in the rites and trained in their practice. In the event that no Sayyadina was available, it was permitted for the female in the group with the greatest knowledge of such matters to be temporarily consecrated into the office. Common pools of water were kept in sietches for all its members to drink from.

Water was even taken from the newborn's amniotic fluid or bodies of the dead. Each pre-dawn [[dew gatherer]]s with scythelike dew reapers, gleaned the available moisture from whatever plants grew near the sietch; then they earned the morning's harvest to a Sayyadina to receive her blessing before carrying it to the tribe's communal basin.

As the water was consumed, the head of the family chanted: "Now do we consume that which will one day be returned for the flesh of a man is his own, but his water belongs to the tribe "

The communal pool provided the sietch with water daily (although less than a liter for a family of ten). The Sayyadina distributing the water to the head of each family gave her blessings, and prayers of thanks were offered to Shai-Hulud. Other bodily fluid was recycled by the stillsuits or in the [[reclamation chamber]]s of a family, whence it was re-distributed before retiring for the night.

[[Water Rings]] were metallic counters that represented the volume of water released by a body processed through a deathstill and also possessed great social significance, helping to regulate much of the interaction between the sexes. 

Water was also seen as the ultimate bond between individuals whether or not they belonged to the same tribe. For instance, a person from one sietch who saved the life of a member of another was owed a water debt, not only from the person saved but from their tribe as well. The [[water bond]] was considered a heavy burden, and was paid and cancelled as quickly as possible.

The water of one group's dead, if shared with another, also created a bond this one indissolvable. Once such a sharing had taken place, the two groups were no longer seen as distinct, since water, once mixed, was impossible to divide.

Equally, if one could force or convince a stranger or enemy to drink of his blood, he became ''[[Wadquiyas]]'' with the tribe: joined to them as one of their own, and safe from having his water taken unless he offended the tribe. Because of this custom, no Fremen would ever attempt to wound an enemy in a fight by biting, no matter how a certain victory would grant to him).

Pledges of loyalty to a single person, (e.g. to a naib of a tribe), were also made in the name of the water of the individual. A tribe's pledge to its leader did not end, nor its acceptance of the new leader's rights begin, until the funeral service for the dead naib was completed and his water free.

'''Sabiha''' (born circa 10197 AG) is a member of the clandestine Sietch known as [[Fondak]] (formerly [[Sietch Jacurutu|Jacurutu]], the niece of [[Namri]], and the cousin of[[Javid]]. She had dark hair and fair skin, deep-set blue-in-blue eyes with a greenish cast, a small nose and wide mouth above a sharp chin.

She and her father act as guardians for [[Leto II Atreides]] while he stays in custody of [[Gurney Halleck]], and she nurses him when he is forced to undergo a spice trance. In the trance Leto foresees that he and Sabiha could become lovers in the future, but chooses to avoid this path in order to realize his own destiny and, after telling her of the vision, sending her into a confusion, sends her to sleep before escaping. They later meet again at Shuloch, where Sabiha is surprised to find him alive (he left into the desert with a sabotaged [[stillsuit ]] in the midst of a sandstorm) and resentful to him for disgracing her and causing her banishment from Fondak. She later recognised his genuine feelings for her when he cried for the future with her he had forsaken at the goading of [[Muriz]].

She was one of the first to see Leto's new skills at the beginning of his transformation.

With the Emperor, she mothered [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]] the Younger, and [[Ghanima Atreides]].

==History==
=== Upbringing ===
Chani was born on [[Arrakis]], the daughter of the half-[[Fremen]] planetologist [[Liet Kynes]] and his full-[[Fremen]] wife. She gradually developed into a formidable fighter, and by the time of her father's death was serving under [[naib]] [[Stilgar]].

=== Introduction and Life with Paul ===
When [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and his mother [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] escaped from [[Arrakeen]] after the invasion of [[House Harkonnen]] they quickly found themselves in the deep desert of [[Arrakis]]. There, while sheltering in a cave system from a [[sandworm]] they were intercepted by a group of traveling [[Fremen]], which included Chani.

Her introduction to [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] came during a tense stand-off. Chani was familiar to the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] heir because of her appearance in his prescient visions prior to his arrival on [[Arrakis]]. But to her [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] was initially a stranger.

After the integration of [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] into the [[Fremen]] by [[Stilgar]], Chani began her long-lasting love affair with the young Duke, and eventually bore him a son, [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|Leto]]. However, their first born was murdered by a [[House Corrino]] raiding party while [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], Chani and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] were away visiting another [[sietch]].

After the defeat of [[House Harkonnen]] and [[House Corrino]] on [[Arrakis]], and [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] subsequent ascent to Emperor and marriage to [[Irulan Corrino]], Chani became his official concubine and remained his exclusive partner.

=== Pregnancy and Death ===
Twelve years later, when Chani became pregnant once again, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]] sought to usurp her and become the bearer of [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] children. She found support with the [[Bene Gesserit]], who feared the impact of Chani's largely-unknown bloodline on their breeding program.

However, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan's]] attempts to terminate Chani's pregnancy through drugs failed. After a traumatic pregnancy, (the pregnancy was accelerated by Spice, taking only five months instead of nine) Chani gave birth to twins, who [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] named [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].

[[Irulan Corrino|Irulan's]] treachery did, however, bring a secondary result. Chani died shortly after giving birth to the twins, due to complications stemming from the drugs [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] titular wife had been surreptitiously feeding her.

The [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Scytale]] offered immediately to resurrect Chani in an [[Axlotl Tanks|Axlotl Tank]]. Yet despite the temptation, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] refused, knowing the impact such an event would have on the [[Golden Path]].


==Physical appearance==
Chani was described as skinny with an elfin face and had pure, dark blue eyes with no white in them. She had long tawny-red hair.

==Behind the Scenes==
*In the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel novels, Chani's birth year is given as 10174, making her even older than Paul. However, in the ''Dune Encyclopedia'', her birth is given as 10177.
*Chani was played by [[wikipedia:Sean_Young|Sean Young]] in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie]], by [[wikipedia:Barbora_Kodetová|Barbora Kodetová]] in both the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 Dune miniseries]] and the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]] and by Zendaya in the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 movie]].
*In 2010, actress Sean Young posted a behind-the-scenes video, shot by herself with a Super-8 camera during filming, on her Youtube channel.
