The Tyrant
{{Original}}

'''The Tyrant''' is the term by which some, most notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], knew Emperor [[Leto Atreides II]].

The term is associated with [[Leto Atreides II]] because of the iron grip by which he ruled the known '''Dune''' universe for some 3,500 years, a period in which many ambitious groups, especially the [[Bene Gesserit]], were prevented from wielding any significant power.

Leto Atreides II the Elder
{{Original}}

[[File:Letodune2000min7series.png|thumb|Leto in the Dune 2000 TV miniseries]]

'''Leto II the Elder''' was the first born child of [[Paul Atreides]] and his lover (and later concubine) [[Chani Kynes|Chani]]. He was murdered in infancy during a [[Sardaukar]] attack on the [[sietch]] where he was being hidden.

Leto II the Elder is sometimes also referred to simply as [[Leto II]], and at times Leto II the [[God Emperor]]/[[Tyrant]] (the twin of [[Ghanima Atreides]]) is referred to as [[Leto III]].

Priests on Rakis, some 1500 years after the God Emperor's death, theorised that Leto II the Elder was reincarnated in the second child by [[Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]] and that a part of him remained in Heaven, nameless, to assist in the transition after death.

==Behind the Scenes==

Leto II the Elder is omitted from the [[Dune (film)|1984 Dune film]] , while his portrayal in the [[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|2000 Dune miniseries]] is largely the same as in the book, though he was killed by an unidentified Sardaukar rather than Rabban.

{{Quote|He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, truthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides) | Muad'Dib]]'s motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of [[Battle of Arrakeen | his triumph]], he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. That is reason enough."|from "[[Arrakis]] Awakening" by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
'''Paul Atreides''' ([[10176 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), predominantely known as '''Muad'Dib''', was the first [[Kwisatz Haderach]], the last [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides]] from [[10191 AG]] until [[10196 AG]], the first and founding [[Padishah Emperor]] of the [[Atreides Empire]] from 10196 AG until [[10210 AG]], and the supreme religious leader of the [[Fremen]] as the accepted [[Mahdi]] from [[10193 AG]] onwards. The only son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides]] {{C|née [[Nerus family | Nerus]]}}, Paul's early years were overshadowed by correct suspicions of him as the Kwisatz Haderach, achieved one generation early due to the disobedience of his mother in producing a son rather than a daughter.  

When the Atreides were forced by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] into moving from their ancestral homeworld of [[Caladan]] to the desert planet of [[Arrakis]] when Paul was fifteen, he was tested with a [[Gom Jabbar|gom jabbar]] by Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], his success in this test proving him human in the eyes of the Sisterhood. On Arrakis, Paul experienced a supposed attempted assassination attempt using a hunter-seeker, although this was in reality staged by the Harkonnens, the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|historic enemies]] of the Atreides, in order to turn attention away from the traitor planted in the Atreides household, [[Suk Doctor|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]].   

Following the [[Siege of Arrakeen]] which killed his father and decimated the Atreides, Paul and his mother were taken in by the [[Fremen]] tribe of [[Sietch Tabr]] after escaping the Harkonnens and the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]], where Paul killed for the first time in a duel with the Fremen [[Jamis]]. After this fight, Paul took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] among the Fremen and found himself becoming a leader among them, and became a good friend to Tabr [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] and the lover of his niece [[Chani Kynes]].  

Fuelled by the historic prophecies of the [[Lisan al Gaib|Lisan al-Gaib]] planted by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] centuries ago, Paul found himself inching closer and closer to great power. The years he spent on Arrakis, also saw his mother Jessica drinking the [[Water of Life]], an act which allowed her to become a Reverend Mother and one which Paul later went through with himself, and the birth of his [[Pre-born|preborn]] sister, [[Alia Atreides]]. Paul also trained the Fremen in the weirding way of the Bene Gesserit to make them into the guerilla warriors known as the [[Fedaykin]], allowing them to deal serious blows against the Harkonnens and turn the tide in the ongoing [[Desert War]] against them. When the Emperor decided to come to Arrakis himself to crush Muad'Dib and get spice production back on track, Paul launched the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in his use of [[Great Convention|forbidden]] [[atomics]] in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], a battle which also saw the death of [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|his first son]].  

Finally meeting the Emperor personally, Paul revealed to Shaddam that he would destroy all of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet in a chain reaction if he did not allow him to take the Imperial throne, leading to chaos across the [[Known Universe]]. After killing his cousin [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] in a kanly duel, the Emperor and the [[Spacing Guild]] submitted to Paul's will and he was Emperor within three years. Despite his love and loyalty to his concubine Chani, Paul married [[Princess Royal|Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino]] in his quest for the Emperor's seat in the [[Landsraad]], but found navigating this relationship complex and difficult at times.  

After ruling his new [[Atreides Empire]] for twelve years, during which the galaxy was at war in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a jihad]] which the [[Fedaykin]] spread across the universe, Paul was blinded by a [[stone burner]] in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a final conspiracy]] against the Atreides throne, but managed to see through his [[Prescience|prescient]] abilities. This presceience-sight ended after the birth of his twin children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], coinciding with Chani's death, and he walked into the desert according to Fremen Law, his sister Alia becoming [[Regent]] of the empire. In the ensuing times he became known as the Preacher, an identity he held for nine years before he was murdered while preaching his 'heresy', shortly after accepting the [[Golden Path]] planned by his son Leto II, who inherited the Imperium as [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] not long after his death and the suicide of his [[Ego-memory|possessed]] sister Alia.  

==Biography==
===Family lineage===
[[File:Dune 2020 House Atreides.jpg|thumb|The Atreides were an ancient Great House dating back to the time of Agamemnon on Old Earth.]]
[[House Atreides]] was an old and wealthy [[Houses Major|House Major]] in the [[Landsraad]], tracing their lineage back thousands of years to [[King Agamemnon]], a son of [[Atreus]] in [[Greece]] on [[Earth|Old Earth]]. The Atreides had a long-standing [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] with [[House Harkonnen]] dating back ten thousand years to the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The family kept their ancestral world of [[Caladan]] a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to the Harkonnen capital of [[Giedi Prime]]. However, the Atreides were also proficient in war; they maintained [[Swordmaster|Swordmasters]], [[Warmaster|Warmasters]] and [[Mentat|Mentats]] to train and lead their army, and had even developed their own [[Battle Language]].

The [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] brought Paul's parents, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica Nerus]], who was secretly the natural daughter of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], together in [[10175 AG]], with the intention of producing an Atreides daughter who could then mate with [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]] the Sisterhood had long prepared for. However, the Bene Gesserit plans were thrown into disarray when Jessica, due to her deep love of the Duke Leto, bore a male heir, Paul, to his House rather than a girl.  

===Early life {{C|10176-10191}}===
Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-rich planet of Caladan, the ancestral Atreides home. Though he lacked companions his own age, he received tutelage from his teachers, men like [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Wellington Yueh|Doctor Yueh]], as well as deep education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday in the year [[10191 AG]], Paul's father revealed to him that his training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a [[mentat]]. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the [[Landsraad]]. Paul's latent talents also earned him the attention of the Bene Gesserit, who tested him with the [[Gom Jabbar]], as they hoped to salvage their breeding program through him.

===Desert War {{C|10191-10193}}===
====Move to Arrakis====
{{Quote|On that first day when Muad‘Dib rode through the streets of [[Arrakeen]] with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: “[[Mahdi]]!” But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the [[Lisan al Gaib | Lisan al-Gaib]], the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a [[Bene Gesserit]] and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib. |from [[Manual of Muad’Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
[[File:Ha paul hunterseeker-1.png|thumb|Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in the first months on Arrakis.]]
Paul accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] relocated to the desert world of [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. Before their departure, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor's [[Truthsayer]], tested him with the [[gom jabbar]]. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

After a supposed assassination on Paul using a hunter-seeker, Dr Yueh lowered the defensive house shields and used sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught in the [[Siege of Arrakeen]]. The Atreides army was crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape. This attack marked the beginning of the War. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] were sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needed to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan was foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hated the Baron and wished to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to kill their captors and escape into the desert. 

====With Kynes and Idaho====
Paul and Jessica initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flde to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they had died from a coriolis storm.

====Alliance with the Fremen====
[[File:Ha paul jamis fight1-1.png|thumb|Paul fights Jamis to the death.]]
In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers came into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures exploded into awareness. He saw many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he could make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive. After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] proved their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu training – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepted them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also met a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], whom he had long seen in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarmed a proud Fremen, Jamis, who took offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenged Paul to a fight to the death. Although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphed easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. Stilgar gave Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gave himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.

When they returned to the troop's sietch, they discovered the Fremen Reverend Mother was near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they made Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen were about to do, accepted to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realized she has made a mistake, that she was involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who could see genetic memories, and realized that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, would also go through the process. This had truly unfortunate consequences, because it was a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby would not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.
[[File:Paul Atreides with Maker hooks (Frank Herbert's Dune, 2000, Sci-Fi Channel).jpg|thumb|Paul preparing to first ride a sandworm]]
By [[10193 AG]], two years later, Paul had become something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani became his lover and bore him a son, whom he called Leto. He and his mother trained the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who sought out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experienced victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grew. However, in order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he had to become a [[sandrider]]. Paul attempted it and succeeded, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr sprung a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognised his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and called on him and his men to surrender. Gurney was overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrendered his men, and joined Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, were some Imperial spies who attempted to kill Paul. They were unsuccessful, and they were captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gave secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lived on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul used the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he had become a wormrider many of his followers had expected him to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul broke tradition and in doing so forced Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus took power without killing his friend. They returned to Sietch Tabr. Gurney was shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believed she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul did not know. Gurney was about to kill her when Paul walked in, managed to stop him, and explained that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney was almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgave him and he was bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

Paul's power among the Fremen grew, but he was still frustrated. He was not all he could be: he could not control his journeys into the future, and much of it was still blank to him. So he took a truly risky step and consumed a tiny amount of spice essence, and so attempted to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man hd survived this experience, and it seemed that he failed also, because he sank into a coma. Paul neglected to tell anyone what he is doing; many people thought he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believed he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, did all she can to wake him but failed, so out of desperation she called Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realised what a mad thing Paul has done, and used spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time had passed, and he gloried in his new memories and powers — he told his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself was currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He had proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declared that it was now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he came to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levied of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again. By now the Emperor was aware of who Muad'Dib was. In advance of his arrival, he sent a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they managed to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but were driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

====Battle of Arrakeen====
[[File:Concept art Battle of Arrakeen (1984 Dune film).png|thumb|The Battle of Arrakeen led to Paul's overthrow of Shaddam IV]]
After the Emperor himself had landed, Paul launched the final attack. Using the House Atreides' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blew a hole in the Shield Wall that protected the capital of Arrakeen from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoided contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". The Fremen attacked under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorted out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar were unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they were in total surprise, and the Emperor was forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loomed in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatened to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they backed off. In the surprise of Muad'Dib's attack, Alia managed to escape, and in the process killed the Baron Harkonnen.

Realizing that Muad'dib was not some mad Fremen religious leader changed the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenged Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Paul agreed even knowing that it is possible he would die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempted treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphed.

=== As Emperor {{C|10196-10210}}===
[[File:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|Paul replaced Shaddam IV as Emperor of the Known Universe]]
Paul refused to take any more nonsense. He forced the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who controlled space travel. He again threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul is capable of it – and they sent everyone home. The Emperor abdicated and retired to Salusa Secundus in 10196 AG. Paul married the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], and assumed control of the Empire. Irulan later wrote extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought. Paul then [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|sent a Fremen jihad across the known universe]].

Upon crowning himself Emperor in 10196, Paul enacted a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire. A result of this action was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. There was resistance, and Paul found himself increasingly isolated from his family and friends as he decided that the Jihad to implement his vision of mankind's future must be bloodthirsty and relentless. Whole planets were sterilized as some of the [[Great Houses]] put up a struggle against Paul's relentless Fremen armies.

====Conspiracy====
After the bloody jihad ended, Emperor Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion. The order of the Known Universe was maintained through the replacement of Corrino imperial power, which was supported by Sardaukar military strength; with Atreides imperial power, supported by Fremen military strength.

Paul's interpretation of his prescient visions also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.

Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]]. Among the schemes of his enemies were the detonation of a [[stone burner]] near where Paul and his forces stood in [[Arrakeen]], which resulted in his physical blindness. Upon Paul's recovery from this incident, he shocked all by his ability to 'see' despite not having eyes. His perfect prescient abilities allowed him to perceive the world around him.

====Death of Chani ====
Despite being able to 'see' through prescience, doubts began to surface in Paul's mind regarding his interpretation of the future. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out. That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, a plot conceived in the presence of a powerful [[Guild Navigator]]. The [[Bene Tleilax]] gave him a [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], who contained a secret trigger. Concurrently, and part of the plan, Irulan slowly poisoned Chani. 

As the Princesses' toxins slowly worked their way through Chani's body, the [[Chani Kynes|Emperor's Consort]] died during childbirth. Immediately, the [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]], who had been posing as Chani's hand-maid, sprung into action and caused the Idaho ghola to remember his Tleilaxu mission, to kill [[Muad'Dib]]. As this caused a great mental conflict within Duncan, he remembered his past with [[House Atreides]]. Immediately, Scytale realized the great scope of change that had occurred; a ghola had recovered memories of its' former life. Scytale bargained with Paul that the Tleilaxu could bring back a ghola of Chani, complete with her life experiences, for Paul to enjoy in relative obscurity—if the Atreides would abdicate. Instead, Paul killed Scytale. He then ordered Duncan to kill [[Bijaz]].

====Walk into the Desert====
After the birth of his children, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], Paul became convinced he had lost his prescient abilities; he did not foresee the birth of his son, only his daughter. Therefore, as no more than a blind Fremen, Paul disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]], as was the Fremen custom for the blind. This action made a powerful statement: it signified to the Fremen that Paul's interest was for the tribe, and that even he, Usul, Paul who was Muad'Dib, was not above Fremen law.

===As the Preacher {{C|10210-10219}}===
[[File:Preacher01.jpg|thumb|Paul as the Preacher of Arrakeen]]
Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert. By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.

==== Death ====
The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront Alia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Leto. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.

Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion. While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transformation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.

== Appearance ==
In his youth, Paul was a small boy with an oval face, with tousled coal-colored hair and green eyes. After his time among the Fremen, he grew to a a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as desiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the leathery skin. His oval face was like his mother Jessica’s, but he had stronger bones and a browline reminiscent of his maternal grandfather. He had a thin, disdainful nose, long lashes concealing lime-toned, directly staring green eyes, and a hardness in the expression like the old Duke, his paternal grandfather.

== Abilities and skills ==
* '''[[Prescience]]''': As the Kwisatz Haderach long sought out for by the breeding programme of the Bene Gesserit Order, Paul possessed a powerful ability to bridge space and time with prescient ability. From an early age, he experienced visions in his dreams which were reported to the Sisterhood by his mother Jessica and was known to have had visions that were accurate, penetrating, and defied four-dimensional explanation. This was one of the key attributes that made them first suspect him being their long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach achieved early. Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Paul's prescient ability was strengthened by the spice melange he constantly inhaled, and it grew greatest during his alliance with the Fremen people, when he first forsaw the jihad that would be waged across the Known Universe in his name, and began to try and avert it. By the end of his reign, Paul's prescience was so powerful that when he lost his eyesight due to a Tleilaxu stone burner, he could interact with the world around him without aid. This was because he was able to remember all the details of his vision of the future. Essentially, Paul knew where everyone would be and what they would say and do. While this helped him in many situations, it was also ultimately his downfall as he was helpless to prevent his future.
* '''[[Weirding Way]]''': Paul was trained by his mother in the Weirding Way of the Bene Gesserit, allowing him to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. When first encountering Sietch Tabr this saved his life, as he was able to overcome the Fremen who saught to kill him and Jessica for their water by means of the Weirding Way. He later taught the Way to many of the Fremen across Arrakis, making them into skilled and deadly Fedaykin by these means, and this was a key factor in his victory in the Battle of Arrakeen.
* '''[[Voice]]''': At the time the Atreides landed on Arrakis, Paul was also developing the audio-neuro control mechanism of Voice used by the Sisterhood to achieve complete control over a reciever. He demonstrated his emerging talent in this field when, after the decimation of the Atreides and the capture of him and his mother into an ornithopter, he used the Voice to order a Harkonnen agent to remove Jessica's gag so that she could use it even more effectively against him, and thus saving both their lives.
* '''[[Prana-bindu|Prana-bindu control]]''': Paul was taught by the supreme control of nerve and muscles known to the Bene Gesserit as prana-bindu by Jessica, which laid the foundations for his use of the Weirding Way and allowed him to gain a higher control over his body which would come to his advantage at many points in his life.
* '''Swordfighting''': In addition to the Bene Gesserit techniques taught to him by his mother for his survival, Paul became a skilled swordfighter after years of training by his chief Atreides teachers, the renowned Swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, who he nearly bested shortly before the move to Arrakis. This proved to be a vital skill, as he employed it not only to best Jamis after he declared amtal during his early years in Sietch Tabr, but later to kill his cousin, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, another skilled fighter, in a kanly duel at the time of his ascension to Emperor. 
* '''[[Mentat]] training''': For the first fifteen years of his life, much of Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a Mentat by order of his father Duke Leto. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as the Duke of the Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a Mentat-Duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. He became a fully fledged "true" Mentat after first escaping the Harkonnens with his mother, and the high level Mentat abilities he gained at that time would help him at many points in his life, including helping handle the data of the battles of his jihad and allowing him to piece together the nature of the conspiracies which were aimed against him more quickly than he could have otherwise.
* '''Endurance''': Paul's unusual endurance, especially for a male, was noted by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam when she tested him with a gom jabbar, a test which he passed through this skill. She noted that he surmounted more agony in the test than any other human of record.

== Relationships ==
=== Leto Atreides I ===
{{Quote|How do we approach the study of Muad‘Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?|from [[Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries]] by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
Paul respected his father Leto, the penultimate Atreides Duke, who had hopes for a great future for his son as a Mentat-Duke. When Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in a supposed assassination attempt, Leto grew enraged at his Mentat Thufir, who had failed to detect the trap, and was angry that the Harkonnens had tried to take the life of his son. Paul was greatly disturbed when he heard Reverend Mother Mohiam tell his mother: "for the father, nothing", and had an urge to tell Leto what she had said, although he never did. Leto felt like Paul was one of the only people to whom he could reveal his weaknesses and fears as well as entrust the fact that he had never distrusted Jessica, a fact which he told Paul to reveal to her if he never could, and which he did after Leto's death. 

=== Chani Kynes ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Paul|You're the strong one, Chani. Stay with me.|Chani|Always.|Paul and Chani's love|Dune (novel)}}
Paul first encountered Chani Kynes, daughter of the great Planetologist Liet-Kynes, during him and Jessica's initial encounter and fight with the Fremen, but by that point he had dreamed of her many times. Stilgar told her to keep Paul out of trouble and Chani helped Paul in his fight with Jamis by warning him that Jamis fought with either hand, and that he should keep his mind on the knife and not on the hand that held it. From that point they grew closer, calling each other Usul and Sihaya, and she ultimately became his concubine, and the mother of his first son, Leto Atreides II the Elder, who was killed by Sardaukar in the Battle of Arrakeen. After Paul's ascension to Emperor Chani was considered his true wife rather than his titular wife, the Princess Irulan, and became the mother of two further children with Paul, Ghanima and Leto II, before her death. The love between them was shown by her last word: ''Usul''.

=== Duncan Idaho ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}
Paul had a close bond with his Swordmaster teacher Duncan Idaho, who trained him from his earliest years, and he was greatly distraught when Idaho fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, he found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Hasimir Fenring ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Shaddam IV|Kill this upstart for me. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now ... you know the way of it. Kill him. Do it!|Hasimir Fenring|Majesty, I must refuse.|Count Fenring refuses to kill Paul|Dune (novel)}}
Paul first met Count Hasimir Fenring in 10193 AG during his final confrontation with Emperor Shaddam IV, the Count's closest friend, following the Battle of Arrakeen. Upon seeing the Count Paul felt extreme shock, as he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures, but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions. When the Emperor ordered Fenring to kill Paul, he realised that this was because the Count was a failed Kwisatz Haderach, and looking into Fenring's eyes he felt a deep compassion for the Count flow through him, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced. Seeing this, Fenring refused to kill him, accompaning the Emperor into exile on Salusa Secundus afterwards.

=== Gaius Helen Mohiam ===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Paul Atreides|Try your tricks on me, old witch. Where’s your [[gom jabbar]]? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You’ll find me there staring out at you! Have you nothing to say?|Gaius Helen Mohiam|I welcomed you to the ranks of [[human]]s. Don’t besmirch that.|Observe her, comrades! This is a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]], patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach | one person]] their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand... but... I... will... never... do... her... bidding!”|[[Jessica Atreides | Jessica]]! Silence him!|Paul defies Reverend Mother Mohiam|Dune (novel)}}
First meeting the aged Reverend Mother Mohiam when she visited Caladan to test him with a gom jabbar, Paul took instant dislike to the 'old crone', complaining about how she addressed his mother and how she treated him. When Mohiam ordered him to sit as her mother did, he told her that he was not his mother and he preferred to stand, from which she ordained that he hated her a little. Despite being judged human by Mohiam in the test, these feelings continued. He encountered Mohiam again during his final confrontation with the Emperor, terrifying her with his final ultimatum of destroying all melange after pointing out her reliance on spice as a Reverend Mother. She recognised that Paul was indeed the Kwisatz Haderach as she had long suspected. Paul declared that he was indeed the One but he would never to her bidding, and that for her role with the Emperor he could gladly have her strangled, but he thought it better punishment that she should live out her years never able to bend him to the Bene Gesserit schemes. He retained this opinion to the last, telling Alia not to execute Mohiam for her role in the conspiracy against him shortly before his walk into the desert, although she disobeyed him.

==Name==
{{Quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.|[[Stilgar]]|Dune (novel)}}

===Etymology===
Paul's surname, that of his family of [[House Atreides]], meant "son of Atreus" in Greek, due to the Atreides' descent from [[Agamemnon]], Orestes' father and the son of [[Atreus]]. 

The name '''Muad'Dib''', given by Stilgar after Paul bested Jamis in amtal, was taken from the Fremen name for the kangeroo mouse of the Arrakis desert. While he originally called himself '''Paul-Muad'Dib''' after accepting this name, as to not completely remove the name given by his father, this did not become a common name and by his time as Emperor he was generally called only Muad'Dib. While this was the open way to refer to Paul, it was also decided after Jamis' death that the private name used within the sietch would be '''Usul''', meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar" in the Fremen language. He was also called '''Abu Dhur''' or '''Abu d' Dhur'''.

===Titles===
In addition to being the '''Kwisatz Haderach''' long sought for by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, Paul was known as both the '''Lisan al-Gaib''' and the '''Mahdi''' to the Fremen. The vanquished of his jihad called him '''the Tyrant''', a title which would later be used more widely to describe his son, the God Emperor, after his assassination. In his nine years as a nameless blind Fremen after walking into the desert, Paul was known by the title of '''the Preacher''' in absence of any name that could be given to him. He was given the postthumous title of the '''Mentat Emperor''' by the Mahdi Spirit Cult. He was given the title of '''Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time''' while being called Abu Dhur by Stilgar and later his son Leto II, who also called him the '''Fil-Haquiqa''' and '''The Reality'''.

===In earlier stages===
In the original ''[[Spice Planet (story)|Spice Planet]]'' which evolved into ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Paul was called '''Barri Linkam'''.

==Behind the Scenes==
=== Paul as a hero ===
According to novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House Atreus. Noting that the characters in ''Dune'' fit mythological archetypes, Brian Herbert wrote that "Paul is the hero prince on a quest who weds the daughter of a 'king'". A primary theme of ''Dune'' and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to "give over every decision-making capacity" to a charismatic leader. He said in 1979, "The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes." He wrote in 1985, "''Dune'' was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question." In a 1970 interview, Herbert noted that the character of Paul was constructed to express "the conflict between absolutes and the necessity of the moment". Brian Herbert wrote:<blockquote>Paul Atreides (who is the messianic "Muad'Dib" to the Fremen) resembles Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), a British citizen who led Arab forces in a successful desert revolt against the Turks during World War I. Lawrence employed guerrilla tactics to destroy enemy forces and communication lines, and came close to becoming a messiah figure for the Arabs. This historical event led Frank Herbert to consider the possibility of an outsider leading native forces against the morally corrupt occupiers of a desert world, in the process becoming a godlike figure to them.</blockquote>The similarity to T.E. Lawrence was reinforced within the novel ''Dune Messiah'', in which a chapter heading-quotation is taken from a post-conquest work of Paul's, with the title ''The Seven Pillars of the Universe''. This appears to have been inspired by Lawrence's account of his war-time activities in the desert, titled ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''.

Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him, and after a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. As such, ''Dune'' is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means. Paul's riding and controlling a giant sandworm cements him as a Fremen leader, and he eventually gains a level of omniscience which leads to his accession to the Imperial throne and causes the Fremen to worship him like a god.

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of ''Dune'' from earlier heroes such as Superman, A. E. van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn, and Henry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of "painful and slow personal progress". And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through "the application of mystical philosophies and techniques". For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit and Mentats).

Denis Villeneuve, director and co-writer of the 2021 film adaptation ''Dune'', compared Paul to the character Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather'', explaining that "He's training to be the Duke. But as much as he's been prepared and trained for that role, is it really what he dreams to be? That's the contradiction of that character. It's like Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather''–it's someone that has a very tragic fate and he will become something that he was not wishing to become."

The Egyptian-Canadian commentator Khalid M. Baheyeldin has enumerated the obviously Islamic concepts and references appearing in ''Dune'', to the level of finding multiple similarities between the career of Herbert's Paul Atreides and that of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Beyond the obvious general resemblance - both Muhammad and Atreides found a powerful new religion, energizing hitherto disregarded desert-dwellers to topple an old empire and build a new one - Baheyeldin noted various specific similarities between Muhammad's career and that of Atreides.

===Biographical Notes===
In the easy-to-read Basic Dune it is bizarrely extrapolated in what is probably a joke that its fake version of Paul Atreides was born on its underdeveloped Caladan, both in an excerpt from [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan's]] ''Manual of Muad'Dib'', as well as through his own thoughts. However in the great and hard [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson|Kevin J. Anderson's]] Canon Status prequel novel ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'', his birth is revealed in the only serious and Canon to take place on the world of Kaitain. At the end of the day, only Base Dune novices debate this as his birthworld in a serious manner.

In the Canon Status ''[[Paul of Dune (novel)|Paul of Dune]]'', it is revealed to be true in full Canon that Irulan, through her history books, "streamlined the story for mass consumption". This cleverly alleviates any concern ffor ridiculous Base Dune and retains the clearly lower Canon status of the Basic Dune as a lower form, as accpeted by Dune fans globally.

===In Other Media===
Alejandro Jorodowski wanted his then 12-year-old son Brontis Jodorowski to star as Paul in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''.

In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, MacLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.

In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]]. The actor, who has a Scottish accent, reportedly adapted an American accent in a relatively short span of time just to land the role. In the 2000 miniseries, Paul was initially portrayed as a sort of "spoiled brat" in order to show the audience his growth from Atreides heir to Emperor of the Known universe.

In the Denis Villeneuve's [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 ''Dune'' film]], Paul was played by Timothée Chalamet. Villeneuve stated that Chalamet was his first and only choice to play the role of Paul Atreides saying "Timothée has that kind of charismatic power. And I needed that for the audience to believe this young man will be able to raise and lead an army, and then lead a whole planet."<ref>[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/10/20/timothee-chalamet-dune-denis-villeneuve-rebecca-ferguson/8424993002/ Timothée Chalamet learned this new skill from 'Dune': 'I hope I won't have to use it']</ref>  Chalamet be reprising the role of Paul Atreides in the sequel to ''Dune'', titled ''Dune: Part Two'', which is scheduled to release on October 20, 2023.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dune-2-greenlit-movie-release-date-1235036655/'Dune 2' a Go From Legendary, Warner Bros.]</ref>

}}{{Quote|What can I say about Jessica? Given the oppurtunity, she would attempt [[Voice]] on [[God]].|[[Reverend Mother/XD | Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD | Gaius Helen Mohiam]]|Dune: House Corrino}}
'''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG/XD|10154 AG]] - [[10256 AG]]), born as '''Jessica Nerus,''' was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son Emperor [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], and of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

== History ==
===Upbringing===
A result of the [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] and [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]], who was called by her birth name Tanidia Nerus in breeding charts.

Due to this, prior to marrying Leto she was referred to as Jessica Nerus in Bene Gesserit records, as opposed to Jessica Mohiam or Jessica Harkonnen, which was top secret information and she was not named this.

She was raised from birth by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides]] heir Leto Atreides I, to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced Bene Gesserit education and training.
====Relationship with Leto Atreides I====
[[Image:Jessica.jpg|thumb|left|The Lady Jessica, bound concubine of the Duke Leto Atreides, played by [[Francesca Annis]]]] The Bene Gesserit plan to couple Jessica with Duke Leto Atreides I initially appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the official concubine of Leto Atreides I, which allowed him to also marry. Such political union prove advantageous for the Great [[House]].

However, Jessica felt a great pity from the grief that Leto felt over the death of his first son, [[Victor Atreides]].

The relationship between the two quickly evolved into genuine love, and due this love, Jessica disobeyed her orders and give birth to a son, Paul Atreides, who would be heir of House Atreides, and ultimately ruined the Bene Gesserit plans.

====Ilesa Ecaz====
In [[10,187 AG]], when Leto announced that he was going to marry [[Ilesa Ecaz]] to strengthen House Atreides, Jessica took this in dutiful stride. Out of her love for Leto, she genuinely tried to welcome Ilesa to [[Cala City]], and showed her the daily tasks of managing [[Castle Caladan]]. Ilesa was suddenly killed during the wedding ceremony, situation that started the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]. Once the war ended, Leto promised he would never marry, and that Jessica would be his one and only mate.

====Tessia Struck====
In [[10,188 AG]], Jessica and Paul visited [[Ix/XD|Ix]] so that Paul could spend time as an exchange student in [[Vernii]] City, just as his father had done decades earlier. To Jessica's dismay, while there, the Bene Gesserit [[guilt-caster]] [[Stokia]] and three other Sisters visited [[Tessia]] Vernius. They demanded that Tessia produce more children for the Gesserit breeding program, which Tessia refused.

Unbeknownst to Jessica, Stokia used her [[psychic]] powers to put Tessia into a comatose trance, which rendered Tessia helpless.

====Bronso and Paul Run Away====
Later that day, Rhombur decided to tell his son, [[Bronso Vernius]], about his true parentage, that he was the artificially conceived son of [[Tyros Reffa]]. Bronso, who was 11 years old, reacted bad and encouraged Paul to run away with him off-world. Jessica was concerned about her missing son, and [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] were dispatched from [[Caladan]] to aide in finding them. A few days later, they received information that both arrived first to [[Chusuk/XD|Chusuk]], and now could be found on [[Balut]] with a [[Jongleur]] performing group.
When Jessica and the rest of the searchers from House Atreides and [[House Vernius]] arrived on Balut, they found both Bronso and Paul well treated by the performing group. The Jongleur group was to give a performance in honor of the Governor of Balut's upcoming marriage in the planet's famed [[Theater of Shards]]. Paul was able to figure that an assassination attempt was planned.

Paul saved the life of the planetary Governor [[Alra Kio]], but when Rhombur pushed Balut's leader out of the way, the intense sound blast hit him, and ravaged his body. Jessica and the others recoiled in horror as Rhombus died, and Bronso cradled his dying father.

Just before Rhombur died, he whispered his last words to his son, "Is Paul safe?" Deeply hurt that his father did not speak of him or his mother while dying, Bronso cast Jessica and the rest of House Atreides out of his life for the next 12 years. The Atreides returned to Caladan.
=== Migration to Arrakis ===
[[Image:Dune210106-12.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|The Lady Jessica takes the Water of Life]] In [[10,191]] AG, when [[House Atreides]] was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]] and their son Paul. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

When [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] seized control of [[Arrakis]], Leto was killed, and Jessica and [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]]. Her grief over losing [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]], who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with his daughter [[Alia Atreides]].

====Life as a Widow====
=====Reverend Mother=====
The Fremen of [[Arrakis]] were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own [[Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her. Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged [[Reverend Mother]], Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to [[Reverend Mother]] status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination]] in her daughter Alia.

=====Duchess of Caladan=====
After her son conquered both [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]] and House Harkonnen to become Emperor, Jessica remained on [[Arrakis]] for a year. She accompanied Emperor [[Muad'Dib]] on his first official state visit back to [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. Paul and Jessica met with the minor [[Ecaz]] official that Paul had put in place as governor of Caladan, the Prince [[Xidd Orlaq]].

While there, Paul attempted to return to the joy of his childhood, but was unable to, as he realized that he was no longer just a Duke, but an Emperor. When a courier came to [[Cala City]], announcing that Fremen warriors had taken [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], Paul made his mother, [[Duchess]] and ruler of the water planet; a post that Jessica was happy to assume. A year later when Jessica visited Paul on Arrakis, she arrived with Gurney Halleck.

In Caladan, Jessica and Gurney settled into the rule of the planet with continued justice and fairness. She exspecailly loved to join in the local festivities in [[Cala City]] during the changing of the seasons. One such festival was the one of the "[[Empty Man]]".

=====Visit to Salusa Secundus=====
Paul asked his mother to accompany [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]] and [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]] on a fact-finding mission to the exiled [[Corrino]] homeworld of [[Salusa Secundus]] provide an update on the status of the terra-forming of the planet. On Salusa Secundus, the former [[Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] and his aide [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] greeted Jessica's entourage and invited them to a formal dinner. While there, the conversation was steered by Fenring towards Paul's sterilization of worlds. Only Chani could speak positively of Emperor Paul's actions.

Later that week, the fact-finding tour was guided to the other side of Salusa to witness terra-forming first hand. [[Lars Siewesca]], his assistant [[Qhomba]] and the rest of the world-altering [[planetologist]]s blew up an underground aquifer. Lars reported to those assembled that the water from the aquifer would irrigate nearby canyons and that Salusa would be a garden in a couple of centuries. Jessica observed that Shaddam had said out loud that he could not wait that long, reminding Jessica of Corrino treachery of the past.

=====The Sisterhood's Offer=====
As the years went by, and [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's Jihad]] reached fever pitch, Jessica began to wonder of her son's sanity, believing that perhaps he had turned to [[Abomination]]. During a visit to the Motherhood on Wallach IX, Jessica was approached by Mohiam and Mother Superior [[Harishka]], who offered Jessica the post of [[Mother Superior]] of the entire Bene Gesserit order, if she kill Paul.

As Jessica thought of all of the human suffering that Paul had created throughout the universe, and though torn by the thought of killing her own son, Jessica inwardly agreed that Paul had indeed become the most brutal ruler in the history of mankind.

=====Rise of Bronso=====
In a secret meeting, Paul arranged to meet his mother and the now restored relationship with [[Bronso Vernius]] of the planet [[Ix]]. Suddenly Paul stepped out of the shadows, to explain to his mother the role of the Jihad.

Paul explained to Jessica that he ''had'' to sterilize those worlds, because the people that had looked upon him as some type of Messiah, have to learn the kind of tyranny that false messianic hopes could foster. After seeing his atrocities, mankind never would trust in one human for a type of salvation again. He calmly explained that he planned to sterilize even more worlds, but was secretly evacuating the populace of each world to limit the number of deaths. He also told her about Bronso's secret mission—to write diatribes and publications about Paul's failings.

=====Murder for Peace=====
Jessica immediately returned to Caladan to find the planet in an uproar. The people of the water world had declared independence from the [[Emperor]], and were holding rallies of secession. Gurney, in Jessica's absence had tried to negotiate and reason with the planetary rebels, to no avail. When Jessica arrived at [[Castle Caladan]] in [[Cala City]], she summoned ten of the secessionist leaders to brokering negotiations. Jessica served them all a bountiful dinner with toasts of drinking water.

Unbeknownst to the rebels, Jessica secretly poisoned the water, and turned the toxic substance into an inert mixture in her own body, by using Gesserit techniques. As the mayor of Cala City, and others that Jessica had known for years fell and dropped dead, realized that she "did what she had to do" to save Caladan from the misguided rebel leaders, and from Paul's wrath had he found out about the rebellion.

====After the Death of Paul====
Immediately after the supposed death of Paul, Jessica returned with Gurney to Arrakis, out of concern for her grandchildren, Leto and Ghanima. By this time, she had somehow learned of her maternal parentage. She was also dismayed about the rising cruelty that her daughter Alia used in consolidating her power after Paul's "death". She watched with alarm as Alia created the [[Mahdinate]], a super-religious organization based on the Atreides family. Jessica was also concerned about how Alia banned all forms of opposing expression, and had executed Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso]] Vernius of Ix, for his writings the changes that Paul had gone through. She eventually returned to Caladan in deep concern for the Empire.[[Image:Jessica2.jpg|thumb|Lady Jessica by M.Stribling]]
===Later Years===
Jessica returned to [[Arrakis]], long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

For her protection against her murdering daughter, [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] (the ghola formerly known as Hayt) "kidnapped" Jessica and took her to Salusa Secundus, home of the exiled Corrino House. There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

===Legacy===
In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]]) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

Moneo Atreides
{{Original}}{{Cleanup}}[[File:Img159.jpg|thumb|Moneo - Illustration by Klaus D. Schiemann]]

'''Moneo Atreides''' ([[13610 AG]] - [[13728 AG]]) was the last [[majordomo]] of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], [[Leto Atreides II]]. Moneo was a direct descendant of [[Ghanima Atreides]] and the great [[Farad'n Corrino]], and the son of a [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho]]. He had one child, [[Siona Atreides]].

In many ways, Moneo would prove himself the ablest administrator of all who had filled that position in the thirty-five centuries of Leto's reign, as well as one of the longest-tenured. (He served the God Emperor for eighty-nine years, the last seventy in the capacity of majordomo.) Prior to his entry into Royal Service Moneo had used his formidable talents for organization and planning in quite a different cause: for many years he ran a highly efficient group of rebels dedicated to removing the God Emperor from his throne.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Moneo was trained in logic and pragmatism by the finest scholars and experts. As an Atreides, heir in name if not in flesh to Leto II himself, he had suffered no scrimping in his education — and had selected his position regarding the God Emperor with great care. Leto, he reasoned, was a monstrosity; one look at the gross pre-worm body proved that. Humankind, whatever its faults, deserved better than the tyrannic rule of a monster. Leto, then, had to be eliminated.
But Moneo was no usurper. The genius of his scheme was that he never once suggested that he or any other mortal could take up the Imperial Godhead. Instead, he explained to all who would listen that ridding humanity of its despotic ruler would plunge it into anarchy and chaos. From that maelstrom, he insisted, would emerge a new race once again in control of its own destiny.

Leto was ever mindful of the lesson taught the [[Bene Gesserit]] by [[Paul Atreides|his father]] - that it was entirely possible for the breeding program's end result to materialize unexpectedly early. Leto therefore thought it best not to chance Moneo's being outside the scope of prescience. He was to be tested, to be sensitized to the God Emperor's [[Golden Path]], or be left to die if found wanting. And the test would be one exquisitely tailored to the individual. No amount of preparation could help him escape judgment.

==The Test==

[[File:Img162.jpg|thumb|Moneo - Illustration by Klaus D. Schiemann]]

Leto slid from the Royal Cart and herded him down into a cavern maze concealed beneath the [[Citadel]] and abandoned him in its center with a bag of food and a vial of [[spice melange|spice-essence]]. For more than a day, Moneo wandered through the twisting maze, eating sparingly from his meager store and becoming more thoroughly lost with each passing hour. The multiple ironies surrounding the spice-essence vial tormented him, monopolizing his otherwise unengaged thoughts. It was the only liquid provided him, and he would surely be driven to consume it unless he could quickly find a way out of the maze. That prospect, carrying as it did the certainty of exposure to the [[Other Memory|"internal multitude"]] the Atreides were said always to harbor, frightened him far more than the idea that he might die of thirst. And yet, among that terrifying throng, was it not likely that there existed a previous servant of the Lord Leto whose memories included the directions for escaping the maze? After another twelve hours had passed, leaving him even deeper in confusion, Moneo realized that he had no choice. He drank the contents of the vial, then sat down, his back in a corner, to await its effects. They were not long in coming.

The melange opened Moneo's awareness, not only to his ancestral voices, but to the prescient scenes of death and destruction that Leto — and his father — had witnessed so long ago. They showed him the end of humanity as well as the means by which that end could be averted: the Golden Path that the God Emperor had chosen. They showed him the reason for the monstrosity he had fought more clearly than he might have wished to be shown. A timeless period later, when the effects of the spice wore off, Moneo was left with two certainties. The first was the escape route he must follow back up to the Lord Leto's chamber, where he would be expected. The second was that he would obey the God Emperor faithfully for the rest of his life, if only out of gratitude that Leto, and not he, had been forced to make the choice he had seen.

==Loyalty to the God-Emperor==
Over the next nineteen years, Moneo was groomed to take over his mother's administrative post. He was given increasingly more responsible assignments to carry out for Leto: maintaining an overall record of the farflung [[Fish Speaker]] garrisons, for example, and acting as Leto's intermediary with the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]].

Moneo kept the Court running flawlessly. No detail was too petty to attend to, no arrangement too minor to oversee, if it involved the interest of the Lord Leto. Moneo desired only three things in return for his labors: to enjoy the confidence of his ruler, to be allowed to abstain from any further experience with melange, and to preserve a quiet domestic life. Leto permitted these things, but commanded him to marry Seyefa, a Fish Speaker many years his junior.

==Siona Atreides==
[[Siona Atreides|Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides]] was Moneo's only child. She lived with her parents in quarters near Leto's Citadel until the age of ten, when she was sent to the Fish Speakers school in Onn. Shortly after this separation, Seyefa died the following year.

If he had been a dutiful servant before, Moneo was now fanatic in his devotion to Leto. Leto was often amused by the
anger and solicitude Moneo lavished on his daughter. The former rebel appeared to be unable to see his own youth in hers; he viewed her rebellion not as a temporary and necessary phase but as a permanent and dangerous change. While the God Emperor also valued Siona (although, for quite different reasons from those Moneo held) he recognized the uselessness of attempting to steer her every move. Moneo sometimes did not, and needed reminding.

==Death==
In 13724, Moneo clashed with his daughter, for the last time. While journeying to Tuono Village for the Lord Leto's wedding to Hwi Noree, Moneo was trapped in the ambush staged by Siona, [[Nayla]], and Duncan Idaho. Early in the attack, Moneo lost his footing on the collapsing [[Royal Road bridge]] and plunged into the [[Idaho River]], to his death. Hanging onto a bridge cable, he witnessed the death of [[Hwi Noree]] but fell prior to the Lord Leto. In the space of a few minutes, life for the entire Imperium had been irreversibly altered.

Leto had once observed that once Moneo was enlightned by the [[Golden Path]], he became terrified of the idea of a world without the God Emperor — that he would rather die than face such an existence. Of all the choices made for him during his life, the timing of the majordomo's death may have been one of the kindest. His final words were ''"Siaynoq! I believe!"'' just seconds before his death.

==Notes==

[[File:Hqdefault-4-1-1.jpg|thumb|Noree Moneo]]

*"Moneo" is Latin for "I advise", quite befitting Leto II's chief aide
*The Character [[Noree Moneo]] in the [[Dune 2000 (video game)|Dune 2000]] derives his name from Moneo Atreides and [[Hwi Noree]].
*He likes yogurt, When Leto II asks Hwi Noree if she is friends with moneo, she says they are "friends of the stomach" in the fact that they both like yogurt.

{{Quote|Here I am, here I remain!|Leto Atreides I|Dune (novel)}}
'''Duke''' '''Leto Atreides I''' ([[10140 AG]] - March<ref>According to Appendix IV, eight months before [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who was born in November. </ref> [[10191 AG]]), frequently referred to as the '''Red Duke''' and sometimes called '''Leto the Just''', was the twentieth and penultimate [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides]] and the father of [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]] and [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]] with [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]], [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]]. Well known for his even-handed and compassionate leadership style, Leto ruled over [[Caladan]], and later [[Arrakis]], all while [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|at war with]] the powerful [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Harkonnen]].

==Biography==
===Migration to Arrakis===
After almost two decades of rule on [[Caladan]] with the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], Leto was ordered by the Emperor to take over the planetary fief of [[Arrakis]] from [[House Harkonnen]], and thus was required to move his House from Caladan to 'Dune'. Arrakis was a notoriously difficult planet to manage, but as the only source of the [[spice melange]], it was also unimaginably important. Thus the role brought both jeopardy and the jealousy of Leto's fellow noblemen among the [[Great Houses]]. Thus, Leto leapt at the chance to increase his standing in the Landsraad, even though he knew it would also put his House in great peril. Leto committed all his resources to the venture, and it was said that to illustrate this point to his people and the people of Arrakis, that upon his arrival he planted a flag upon the battlements at Arrakeen and proclaimed: "''Here I am, here I remain!''"

Leto's resolve was strengthened by a letter the Emperor had sent him upon his Arrival on Arrakis. Addressed to his "Noble Duke", the letter outlined that Leto was given House Corrino's full support to introduce and uphold the rule of the [[Faufreluches]]. This letter served to illustrate Corrino duplicity, for at the same time, [[Shaddam IV]] was plotting Leto's demise.

During consolidation of his rule over Arrakis, Leto made a quick and positive impact on the people of Dune. His fairhandedness, political savvy, and personal charisma saw many in Arrakeen society, from the [[Fremen]] to the aristocratic Houses Minor, become supporters. However, only a short while into Leto's rule on Dune, the Emperor gave Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] approval to invade and destroy House Atreides, even going so far as to provide some of his own [[Sardaukar]] in support. The Emperor's urgency in disposing of House Atreides was amplified by the fact that he had come to know that the Duke Leto had managed to develop a small force of soldiers capable of rivalling the Emperor's Sardaukar. This had been accomplished through Leto's principal advisors and generals, namely [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho]], and [[Gurney Halleck]].

===Death===
During the invasion Leto was betrayed by his private [[Suk]] Doctor, [[Wellington Yueh]], and turned over to the Harkonnens. Though Yueh had given Leto the chance to kill the Baron Harkonnen using a poisoned tooth embedded in the Duke's mouth, the scheme failed. Consequently Leto died during the assassination attempt, but the Baron Harkonnen survived - although his twisted mentat Piter de Vries was killed by the poison.

Some years later, Leto's remains were recovered by his son Paul in [[Arrakeen]]. Paul laid his father's remains to rest in the [[Skull Tomb]] in the desert of Arrakis. The late Duke's legacy was felt in [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] reign as Emperor, and also in the conception of a daughter [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], carried by [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] but only discovered after Leto's death.

===Legacy===
In some ways, Leto lived on in his son Paul and grandson Leto II, through their possession of [[Other Memory]]. It was also partially Leto's love for Duncan Idaho that saw Leto II maintain a series of Idaho gholas throughout his reign. During both Paul's and Leto II's reign, millions flocked to visit Leto I's shrine, since Atreides ancestry had taken on a religious mystique. More than this however, Leto came to symbolise all that was good about the Atreides bloodline, namely courage, integrity, loyalty, justice, and honour. Because of this some have postulated that had Leto survived his rule of Arrakis, he would have eventually commanded the same fanaticism of the Fremen with which they came to follow his son Paul. Indeed, some have taken this argument further and postulated that his popularity with those he ruled, combined with his popularity in the Landsraad, may have seen him eventually ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Thus, the positive strength of character and many talents Leto was generally regarded to possess, and the possibilities of what might have been, illustrates the inherent tragedy of his story.

==Appearance==
Leto Atreides I was a tall man with olive skin and long black hair.  He had a narrow face full of angles and planes, with a high-bridged aquiline nose that gave him the look of a hawk, and woodsmoke in his gray eyes.

==Behind the scenes==
* Alejandro Jorodowski wanted the late actor David Carradine to portray Leto Atreides I in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''. Jodorowski became interested in Carradine for the role after watching his series ''Kung Fu''. When they met, the director reportedly passed him a bottle of Vitamin E pills and told him to "take one every day". Carradine swallowed the pills immediately and Jodorowski knew he was "the person I am searching for". Alejandro Jodorowski has stated that he also considered himself for the role, especially given that his son, Brontis, was to have the role of Paul.
* Leto Atreides was portrayed by German actor Jurgen Prochnow in the 1984 film adaptation of Dune.
* In the 2000 ''Dune'' Miniseries, he was portrayed by the late William Hurt.
* In the 2021 film adaptation of Dune, he was portrayed by actor Oscar Isaac.

'''Alia Atreides''' (November<ref>Book II of ''Dune'' ends in mid-autumn, which is late October or early November. Alia has still not been born. Early in Book III, Alia is stated to be about two years old. We also know that it is still 10,193 at the end of Book III, due to Appendix IV. It seems very unlikely that Book III covers just a month, so we can make a fair assumption that Alia was born in November 10,191.</ref> [[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), also known as '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' and later '''Coan-Tean''' ("the female death-spirit who walks without feet") to the [[Fremen]] and called '''Hawt the Fish Monster''' on the outer worlds, was the posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], born on the planet [[Arrakis]]. She was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides]]. As [[regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based on the cult of her personality. She later leapt to her death in defiance of the possession by the spirit of a younger [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] retained in her [[Other Memory]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Alia was still in the womb when Jessica took the [[Water of Life]]. Thus she was [[pre-born]], and highly susceptible to [[Abomination]] from before birth. After living with the [[Fremen]] for several years, she was present in the palace on [[Arrakeen]] when her brother and his forces successfully conquered the combined forces of the [[Emperor|Emperor's]] [[Sardaukar]] and [[House Harkonnen]].

During the invasion she poisoned Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] with a [[Gom Jabbar]], although not before revealing to the latter her familial ties to Harkonnen, and slew dying soldiers on the battle field for their water, earning her the name St. Alia of the Knife.

===Regency===
====Establishing Her Rule====
Later, upon the death of Paul, and with his children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule, Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]]. She was corrupted by power and established a cult of personality, using rich trappings and grandiose titles such as the [[Mahdinate]] to build considerable political weight.

====Into Abomination====
Shortly thereafter, Alia fell fully into Abomination, and was secretly tormented by the living personalities of countless ancestors. Chief among these was the personality of Vladimir Harkonnen, who sought to use his granddaughter as a tool to reclaim power from beyond the grave.

====Relationships====
Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with [[Fremen]] was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.

Though she loved and admired Paul, her brother, she also partly resented his influence. And her love for the original [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] was ultimately destroyed by a casual affair with [[Javid]], one of her priests who secretly served the [[Fremen]] insurgents who plotted against her.

====Spiralling Downward====
During the same years in which she held herself aloof from family and friends, Alia indulged in massive doses of [[spice melange|melange]], ostensibly for the purpose of broadening her [[prescience|prescient]] vision. However, Alia lacked her brother's prescient ability, and the [[spice trance]] most often failed her. The same drug which had initially keyed her sensitivity to her ancestral voices could be depended upon to keep those same voices from becoming blurred or unavailable. As a result, Alia's heavy melange consumption became a means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors and gave them power.

Alia's actions during her Regency were those of a power-hungry woman aided by the memories of generations of ambitious rulers and princelings. Her people began to mistrust and fear her, calling her, by the time of ''Children of Dune'', Coan-Teen, the "female death-spirit who walks without feet." Her every maneuver including her marriage to the first Duncan Idaho ghola, was seen as having been performed in order to solidify her own position, and her manipulation of the children in whose names she ruled was also considered a devious maneuver. Not content with having destroyed herself, she set about to lead her niece and nephew into similarly destructive ways. Since the most direct way of achieving this goal involved the children's becoming enmeshed in their ancestral memories, Alia continually tried to interest them in the spice trance.

====Death====
After increasing pressure and control from the internal genetic council of Vladimir Harkonnen, Alia orders the assassination of [[The Preacher]], despite knowing it was her beloved brother. Upon Leto's return from the desert and a subsequent battle, he gives her a choice, the Trial of Possession or suicide. In a final act of defiance against the surmounting internal control from the Baron, Alia throws herself from a high window to her death, a death that was witnessed by her mother Jessica, the Atreides twins, and Farad'n Corrino.

Had it not been for her death, Alia could have continued to rule for several centuries by regenerating her cellular structure. According to Fremen tradition, as with all Abominations the only cure was death.

===Legacy===
The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. In the months prior to Leto II's death, a [[Cult of Alia]] was discovered on [[Giedi Prime]] by Duncan Idaho's agents. Ultimately, Alia's influence vanished after Leto's death, some three and a half thousand years after her own death.

==Behind the Scenes==
*In the ''[[Children of Dune]]'' TV mini-series, Alia kills herself with a [[crysknife]], instead of committing suicide by autodefenestration.
*[[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] portrayed Alia in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie]]. While still directly responsible for Harkonnen's demise, her method of killing him is slightly different, as she instead telekinetically shoves him out of a window and has a sandworm devour him.
*Laura Burton portrayed the child Alia in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|Dune 2000 miniseries]], while [[wikipedia:Daniela Amavia|Daniela Amavia]] took over the role of the teenaged and adult Alia in the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]].
**Amavia is actually nine years older than [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]] who played Alia's much older brother Paul.

==Trivia==
The name Alia (also spelt Alya or Aaliyah) means "[http://www.behindthename.com/name/alya sky, heaven, loftiness]" in [[wikipedia:Arabic language|Arabic]] and "other, another, else" in Latin. In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 film]], [[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] portrays the character wearing a [[wikipedia:Hijab|Hijab]], a headscarf commonly worn by [[wikipedia:Arab people|Arab]] and [[wikipedia:Muslim|Muslim]] women.

Though it was not shown in the films, in the books Alia was stated to have begun to gain weight toward the end, A "plumpness which had begun to bulge her body", showing she might have been overindulging due to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's influence.

The '''Atreides Empire''', also known as the '''Atreides Imperium''', '''Muad'Dib's Empire''', the '''Second Empire''', the '''Holy Imperium''', or the '''Old Empire''' or '''Old Imperium''' after the death of Leto II, was a colossal theocratic, galactic empire established following [[Paul Atreides]]' [[Fremen]] uprising on [[Arrakis]] against the [[Corrino Empire]], which initially saw the carrying out [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] but later entered three thousand years of [[Leto's Peace]].

The commencement of the Atreides Empire was marked by the moving of the Imperial seat from [[Kaitain]] to [[Arrakeen]] on [[Arrakis]]. Paul, as [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]], ruled the empire for twelve years, before he transferred control to his sister, [[Alia Atreides]] as [[Regent]]. Some years after this, Paul's son [[Leto Atreides II]] ascended to the throne. Thanks to his transformation into a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid, Leto II ruled the empire for some 3,500 years, expanding the Empire to a multi-galactic scale. Upon his death the influence and control of the Atreides Empire began to fade into the background.

Centuries after the death of Leto II, planetary governments existed throughout the Old Atreides Empire in a loose economic federation held together partly by [[CHOAM]] and the Bene Gesserit. Some areas were ruled by the Fish Speaker Council. 1,200 years later, the federation began to slowly fall apart, and the entire Empire with it, as the Honored Matres took over control of an increasing number of planets.

'''Supreme Bashar Vorian Atreides''' [b. [[223 BG]]] was the first person to hold the name of Atreides and the true forerunner of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]], creating its symbol of the [[hawk]] and paving the way for its political success through his prominence among the [[House/XD|Great Houses]] of the [[League of Nobles]], and later the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad League]].  

Vorian was the son of the [[Titans|Titan]] [[General]] [[Agamemnon (Titan)|Agamemenon]], but changed loyalties and escaped the [[Thinking Machines/XD|thinking machines]] and cymeks amid the chaos of the [[Rebellion on Earth|rebellion]] on [[Earth/XD|Earth]] in [[201 BG/XD|201 BG]], fleeing to the League captial of [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]] with [[Serena Butler]] and future [[Grand Patriarch]] [[Iblis Ginjo]] and thus becoming one of the key instigators of the ensuing [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]].  

Despite initial distrust due to his status as the son of Agamemnon during the [[Battle of Earth]] ([[200 BG/XD|200 BG]]), he won many further battles for the League and became a prominent military commander who rose to the rank of [[Primero]] and then [[Supreme Commander]] of the [[Army of the Jihad]]. He then served as [[Supreme Bashar/XD|Supreme Bashar]] of the [[Army of Humanity]], his most famous victory in that role being that of the [[Vengeance Fleet]] in the [[Battle of Corrin/XD|Battle of Corrin]] ([[88 BG/XD|88 BG]]), the same event which sparked the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud]] with his fight with [[Abulurd Harkonnen/XD|Abulurd Harkonnen]]. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|223-203 BG}} ===
Vorian Atreides was born on [[Earth/XD|Earth]] to a female human [[slave]] of the thinking machines who had been impregnated with the sperm of the [[Titan]] leader [[Agamemnon (Titan)|General Agamemnon]], of whom Vorian was his thirteenth son. Though he was aware that his lineage stretched back to the [[Greece|Greeks]], Vorian never knew his mother, and spent little time with his warring father, despite growing a close bond with him.

Due to his lineage, intelligence and charisma, Agamemnon's thirteenth son became his most pomrising and earned a position as a [[human]] [[trustee]] in [[Omnius]]' [[Synchronized Worlds|empire]]. Vorian's main role was to accompany the [[independent robot]] known as [[Seurat]] on one of Omnius' [[Update ship|update ships]], which the young human jokingly named the ''[[Dream Voyager]],'' a title which stuck for both Vorian and Seurat. The ''Dream Voyager'' travelled between the [[Synchronized Worlds]] and delivered update [[gelsphere]]s to different incarnations of the [[evermind]] to the machine-controlled worlds.

Vorian was initially loyal to his father, who he admired greatly. Per his father's wishes, Vorian initially desired to become a [[cymek]] and realize Agamemnon's dream of becoming the heir of the Titan leadership after his dreamed death in battle. After surviving an encounter with the [[League Armada]] above [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] shortly after [[Liberation of Giedi Prime|its liberation]] using his quick thinking in [[203 BG]], he was rewarded by his father with [[life extension]] treatment that dramatically slowed down his body's aging process, as Omnius had allowed this but had not yet permitted Agamemnon to make Vorian a cymek.

=== Change of loyalties {{C|203-201 BG}} ===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Vorian Atreides|Once I may have been your enemy, but no longer. I am Vorian Atreides.|Iblis Ginjo|Atreides? The son of [[Agamemnon (Titan) | Agamemnon]]?|That burden I must bear. To redeem myself, I will make certain [[Serena Butler | Serena]] is safe. [[Omnius]] will bring in reinforcements soon, even if they come from other [[Synchronized Worlds]]. Don’t let a few days of giddy success blind you to what the [[Thinking Machines/XD | thinking machines]] can do. [[Rebellion on Earth | Your revolt here]] is doomed.|Vorian Atreides and [[Iblis Ginjo]]|Dune: The Butlerian Jihad}}
Shortly after Agamemnon gave him the life extension treatment, Vorian met and began to fall in love with [[Serena Butler]], the daughter of [[Manion Butler]], [[Viceroy]] of the [[League of Nobles]], who had been captured from Giedi Prime's liberation and brought to [[Earth]], becoming a slave in the household of the robot [[Erasmus]]. It was Serena's defiant attitude and questioning nature that began Vorian's questioning of his father's subjective historical accounts.

After beginning to research the details of Agamemnon's memoirs via the more pragmatic records of [[Omnius]] aboard the ''Dream Voyager'' rather than the distorted accounts given in the history books of the Titans, Vorian became disillusioned with his biological father, learning of the Generals' sheer brutality during the [[Hrethgir Rebellions]] and his cold-hearted execution of his [[The Thirteen sons of Agamemnon|first twelve sons]], and had wary thoughts of confronting him. Shortly after, Vorian and Seurat returned to Earth to find that [[Rebellion on Earth|a widespread revolt]] had begun, sparked by the murder of Serena's [[Manion Butler the Innocent|child]] by Erasmus and led by former human trustee [[Iblis Ginjo]]. Seurat allowed him to leaeve the ''Dream Voyager'' but warned him to be wary of the violence.

Vorian searched for Serena, coming to the household of Erasmus, and found her and Ginjo together amidst the chaos. It was at this moment that he finally decided to end his alleigance to the thinking machines, telling Iblis and Serena that he was able to take them off-planet aboard the ''Dream Voyager''. After deactivating and removing Seurat and narrowly escaping the pursuit of Agamemnon, the three decided to flee to [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]], capital of the League of Nobles, where he pledged to serve the free humans in their fight against the [[Titan]]s and thinking machines.

To the League, however, Vorian was still of questionable loyalty, despite the fact that he had been thoroughly interrogated and even examined by doctors for implanted espionage devices. He was finally proclaimed clean after he was blessed by [[Zufa Cenva]], who, as the [[Supreme Sorceress]] of [[Rossak/XD|Rossak]], could detect lies when they were spoken. However, [[Segundo]] [[Xavier Harkonnen]], who had encountered Vorian near Giedi Prime where he had been tricked by the machine trustee, still wondered if the machines could have somehow anticipated all precautions and concealed something in his brain, such as machine components that could be somehow be triggered.

Serena Butler insisted that all humans should be freed from machine control, and this should start with Vorian, who she insisted could still be a valuable ally with inside information. Vorian had already provided exhaustive information on thinking machine warships during his interrogation, and their armor and their integral weapons took a position in the following [[Battle of Earth]] under strict controls in certain areas, and watched at all times.

During the Battle of Earth, Segundo Harkonnen had given him strict orders to accompany the warhead-carrying ships until they dropped their nuclear payloads. However, Vorian happened to detect a lone [[update ship]] exiting Earth's atmosphere. He was faced with a dilemma and felt obligated to abandon his post; should the update sphere pass through, all vital information, along with the orders to annihilate the humans, would be loaded to all the Evermind copies. The bombers he guarded were left undefended and became a short a work for the [[robotic vessel]]s, while he was accused as a coward and a traitor, but he knew he did the right thing.

Soon after, he boarded the vessel, which by chance, was guided by Seurat. Vorian stunned his old friend with an [[Electronic scrambler]] and apprehended the [[gelsphere]]. When he returned to Xavier Harkonnen's [[ballista]], he was about to put on trial for treason, when he presented the silvery sphere, explaining the benefits of his move.

=== Butlerian Jihad {{C|201-108 BG}}===
<blockquote>''Main article: [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]]''</blockquote>

==== Rise in the Army of the Jihad ====
In subsequent decades, Vorian emerged as a major military figure in the Butlerian Jihad, with his trademark being bold and highly inventive tactics. During his long years of service, he became close friends with [[Xavier Harkonnen]], whose military talent was equally formidable yet stylistically very different. Grown in a life of absolute order and loss of individuality, Vorian still tried to become more of a human, therefore being very free-minded and avoided formalities and chains of command, unlike Xavier. Vor's knowledge of machine thinking, programming knowledge and innovative skills helped the Jihad. 

Vorian first distinguished himself in battle during the [[Battle of Bela Tegeuse]], the very first organized attack of the [[Army of the Jihad]] which took place in [[198 BG]]. He returned to [[Bela Tegeuse/XD|Bela Tegeuse]] in [[197 BG]] to find that the [[Thinking Machines/XD|thinking machines]] had rebuilt their industries and reestablished their base, as if nothing had happened there. Vorian was therefore the first to discovery that the struggle and loss of human life, the Jihad had made no progress. By [[185 BG]], he had rose to the rank of [[Primero]].

==== As Primero ====
In [[179 BG|179 BG,]] he proposed that the [[Army of the Jihad]] had to devote its resources and military strength to defending the [[Unallied Planet|Unallied Planets]] as well as League Worlds. At first the [[Jihad Council]] resisted this, but Vorian went on to show tactical projections of how [[Omnius]] was moving, the pattern by which he was taking strategic star systems on the fringe, and so the thinking machines would have bases from which they could launch massive strikes against S[[Salusa Secundus/XD|alusa Secundus]] and other key League Worlds. [[Iblis Ginjo]], now the [[Grand Patriarch]], saw the proposal as a chance to expand League territory.

Vorian commanded the space defense during the [[Battle of IV Anbus]] in [[177 BG]], which was one of the first of these new defenses, with Xavier commanding the land defense. As the battle climaxed in the space above the planet, the Primero managed to drive off the machine fleet using a programmed signal which persuaded the machines that the [[jihadi]] fleet was much large. Shortly after this, a [[cymek]] fleet appeared when the jihadi ships were forced to suppress the over-heated [[Holtzman shield|Holtzman shields]], and after [[Vergyl Tantor]], Xavier's adoptive brother, was taken by the [[Titans]], Vorian exchanged bitter remarks with his father and former idol, Agamemnon, who led the fleet.

In [[176 BG]], Vorian devised the defensive plan for the [[Assault on Poritrin|assault]] of the [[Thinking Machines/XD|thinking machines]] on the wealthy planet of [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]], which used empty hulks of battleships and other defenses. The gambit worked, although most credited [[Savant]] [[Tio Holtzman]] for the idea rather than Primero Atreides, and the machines were fooled and eventually retreated, without any serious damage or loss of life on [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]] ensuing. In [[175 BG]], he placed an Earth-Omnius update reprogrammed with false data on the derelict update ship near Earth, which was inhabited only by a still-inactive [[Seurat]], and restarted the ship. This led to a widespread shutdown of many [[Synchronized Worlds]] as the virus infected each, until Erasmus stopped the ''Dream Voyager'' and destroyed it near [[Corrin]].

When Vorian and other soldiers of the [[Army of the Jihad]] visited the ocean world [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], an [[Unallied Planet]], in order to establish a [[League of Nobles|League]] base there in  [[174 BG]], he used the moniker of 'Virk' and flirted with the local woman [[Leronica Tergiet]]. Eventually they had a brief affair, and she was left pregnant, before Vorian had to leave the planet. 

After Xavier Harkonnen, who had also become a Primero, sacrificed himself in [[164 BG]] to kill [[Iblis Ginjo]], and concurrently had his aide [[Paolo (Quinto)|Paolo]] deliver the message of Iblis's corruption to Atreides, who had returned to [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] while testing one of the new [[Fold space|spacefolding]] ships of [[VenKee Enterprises]]. Vorian was the only person who tried to clear his name.

==== As Supreme Commander ====
In the following years he remained the most longeval member of the [[Army of the Jihad]] until he reached the supreme rank of [[Supreme Commander]] of the Jihad. In the following years, Vorian sent Leronica with their twin sons [[Estes Atreides]] and [[Kagin Atreides]] to [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]], and they never married.

Meanwhile, Supreme Commander Vorian befriended Xavier's grandson, [[Abulurd Butler]], the lesser loved son of [[Quentin Butler]] and became his patron through his advancement in the military ranks. Abulurd was the first person to know the truth about his grandfather, and Vorian approved when Abulurd decided to change his surname to his inherited one of ''Harkonnen''.

During the [[Omnius Scourge]] which devastated the League in [[108 BG/XD|108 BG]], Vorian visited the planet [[Parmentier]] and met with his granddaughter [[Raquella Berto-Anirul]]. It was Raquella that, while thinking about recently deceased Dr. [[Hundri Arbar]], noticed the effects of [[spice]] on the disease and after a brief investigation she realized that spice benefited or even immunized the patients. She notified Vorian about it, who brought the news to the [[League Parliament]].

===== Great Purge =====
<blockquote>''Main article: [[Great Purge]]''</blockquote>When news about [[Omnius]]'s massive fleet against Salusa Secundus arrived following the end of the Scourge, he convinced the League to use spacefolders to launch a broad and coordinated nuclear strike against all [[Synchronized Worlds]] while this would happen. [[Corrin/XD|Corrin]] would be the last target, and by the time the robotic fleet arrived on Salusa, they would be mindless without the existence of Omnius. This plan later became known as the [[Great Purge]]. Vorian appointed Xavier's grandsons [[Faykan Butler]] and [[Abulurd Harkonnen/XD|Abulurd Harkonnen]] to evacuate the planet while [[pulse-atomics]] were constructed and new nuclear warheads were being manufactured frantically on all League industrial planets, while [[Kolhar]] shipyards supplied the jihadi capital ships with spacefolder engines. To reduce the spacefolding hazards, he secretly ordered [[Norma Cenva]] to install the last computerized navigation systems she had kept after they were banned. Vorian also conceived an innovative weapon: satellites armed with pulse-scrambler transmitters. They would be set around Corrin, preventing therefore an Omnius update gelsphere to leave the planet during the final assault. 

Inspired by the update method of Omnius, Vorian devised a network of scouts and messengers; flurries of the small ships bearing reports and records converged at established rendezvous points, dispatching buoys with their detailed data and logs. Other scouts from other battle groups would retrieve and disseminate them, keeping the commanders apprised of the progress.

Vorian was on board the [[LS Serena Victory|LS ''Serena Victory'']] during the battle itself. When the Purge fleet arrived near Corrin, the first machine ships had already returned and the Jihad commanders realized their forces were not enough. [[Quentin Butler]] volunteered for a suicidal strike but was prevented by Vorian. The rest of the machine fleet was returning. As a last measure, they launched the scrambler satellites around the planet. When all of the machine fleet was positioned in defense above Corrin, Vorian ordered activation of the satellite network. As a result, no machine could leave without damaging itself and Omnius remained trapped, being able only to reinforce his existing forces, diminishing the resources of the now-isolated planet.

=== Aftermath {{C|108-88 BG}} ===
After the Jihad, Vorian inherited the [[Old Empire|Old Imperial]] rank of [[Supreme Bashar/XD|Supreme Bashar]], equivalent to that of his former Jihad rank of Supreme Commander. He watched the League of Nobles falling in slumbering laziness and bureaucracy, deciding that the thinking machines did not pose a threat any more, and they neglected the danger of the cymek empire, who rebelled from Omnius' [[Synchronized Worlds]] years ago. Vorian was viewed as a relic of another past age of unrest and violence, and his callings to vigilance and a final coup against Omnius were annoying at best.

In [[107 BG]], Vorian recruited Raquella and her fellow doctor [[Mohandas Suk]] to help form the [[Humanities Medical Commission]] or HuMed, on [[Parmentier]], which he intended to replace the [[Jihad Medical Commission]], after he rediscovered their location and generously sent them whatever aid or equipment they needed, including guards to keep them safe.  He proposed an ambitious new mission to eradicate the last known stronghold of the cymeks on Hessra, where the three remaining [[Titans]], [[Agamemnon (Titan)|Agamemnon]], [[Juno]] and [[Dante]], dwelt, in [[106 BG]], but was labeled a warmonger and actually shouted out of the assembly chamber. Vorian was sidelined and cut out, a symbol of the bloody past and an obstacle to a naively bright future. 

After Omnius made another attack on the League worlds in [[88 BG/XD|88 BG]] with the invention of [[piranha mites]], and their subsequent neutralization by Abulurd, it was learned that his old friend, Quentin Butler was now among the cymeks as a captive. Vorian left all documents and proofs concerning Xavier's death to Abulurd and resigned from the [[Army of Humanity]] and moved to [[Hessra]]. 

Vorian presented himself to his father Agamemnon, as defecting from the League and that he wished to join the cymeks. He played a major role in the destruction of the last remnants of the [[Titan]]s, when he infiltrated his father's fledgling empire and plotted the death of the remaining Titans with the help of the captured [[Quentin Butler]], who died killing the last, [[Dante]], after killing [[Juno]] and Vorian throwing [[Agamemnon|Agamemnon']]<nowiki/>s brain canister out of the window. On his return to Salusa Secundus, he was welcomed back to the Army of Humanity and was awarded by Faykan Butler, who was now Viceroy, with a title made for him, [[Champion of Serena]], a reward for his defeat of the cymeks. Public apprieciation of Vorian was heightened greatly by this new victory.

=== Battle of Corrin {{C|88 BG}} ===
<blockquote>''Main article: [[Battle of Corrin/XD|Battle of Corrin]]''</blockquote>Abulurd noticed that this experience made Vor different. While the Supreme Commander was famed as a cunning tactician using innovative ideas and deceit against the machines, now he seemed more direct and determined. Abulurd compared him to a [[hawk]], and Vor decided that the Hawk would be the symbol of his family. Vorian was now more determined to press the League for the final strike against Corrin, using his newly gained prestige and seeing support from the [[Cult of Serena|Cultists]]. Vorian pushed for a final attack, commanding the [[LS Serena Victory|LS ''Serena Victory'']] against the thinking machines.

In a desperate bid to repel the League forces, the independent robot Erasmus recommended that some two million human slaves (including a clone of [[Serena Butler]]) be put into orbit and linked with the pulse satellites that keep the thinking machines on Corrin. Erasmus then warned the human forces that should they pass the limit, the cargoes would explode, making them responsible for the deaths of two million innocents. While Erasmus had hoped that this [[Bridge of Hrethgir]] would weaken the resolve of the free humans, Vorian's determination to defeat Omnius at any cost saw him order the forces through the defense network, a decision that was protested by a horrified [[Abulurd Harkonnen/XD|Abulurd Harkonnen]]. Abulurd's disgust led him to disobey direct orders and disable the automated weaponry of the fleet. 

After discovering their lack of artillery, a furious Vorian decided to use [[Pulse Atomics]] against the defense forces and push forward. Upon crossing the threshold that should trigger the death of the two million slaves, the fleet was happily surprised to see nothing occur, as unbeknownst to Vorian a trigger had been defused by Erasmus upon his discovery that his human ward [[Gilbertus Albans/XD|Gilbertus Albans]] had joined his beloved Serena Butler clone in orbit.

Seurat contacted Vorian and asked him to lower the ''LS Serena Victory''<nowiki/>'s shields. Vorian, moved by his sentimentality, did so, and Seurat opened fire. Vorian realized that his old friend, the only "person" that he had through all these years, attempted to trick him, and immediately opened fire, destroying Seurat's [[Update Ship]].

When the orbital battle opened a way, Vorian guided his command shuttle toward the center of the main square of Corrin's primary city; the remnants of the mechanical army massed in a protective formation around a central shielded dome. He sent a wave of kindjal attack flyers against the last stronghold of Omnius, softening it up and removing any ground robot defenses. However the dome "healed" itself with each blast, sealing a [[flowmetal]] layer over the gap, but finally it crumbled under the massive detonations by [[Ballista|Ballistas]].

The next move after Vor landed was for the [[Ginaz mercenaries]] to complete their surgical strike. Viceroy Faykan Butler had also landed and was strutting around the battlefield, surrounded by other nobles (who wanted history to record that they had been there personally), while enraged Cultists of Serena raced through the city in an orgy of destruction. Then, he learned that Rayna was buried under the citadel he just bombarded, so engineers and soldiers supported by Ginaz mercenaries went to the rescue when suddenly the plaza cracked open, like a snake bursting out of its hole, the silvery, tentacular growth of the [[Central Spire]] lunged out of the rubble and shot skyward. It formed a parabolic dish and vomited a flash of light through the atmosphere out into space and splattered into puddles across the broad, rubble-strewn plaza.

After Rayna was found alive, and the mercenaries arrived at their target with three surgical pulse-warheads, Vorian and Viceroy Butler retreated with all of the other personnel standing at a safe distance. The battle concluded with the destruction of the last surviving thinking machines and the liberation of many of the surviving slave humans.

When the Battle was over, Abulurd was sentenced to death, but Vorian proposed that Abulurd be named a coward and banished from the League to which his brother [[Faykan Butler]] agreed. He also sentenced that Abulurd would obligatorily retain the shameful name of Harkonnen; Vorian sworn that for ever his descendants would spit upon the name Harkonnen. After that, it was impossible for Abulurd to recover his grandfather's memory. Abulurd was exiled to the backwater planet of [[Lankiveil]] where his family carried on the bitter legacy of his downfall, thus beginning the feud with House Atreides. 

=== Kepler period {{C|88-5 BG}} ===
{{Quote|I have already contributed more than my share to history. For more than two centuries I influenced events and fought the enemeis that were defined for me. Finally I turned by back and walked away. All I wanted was to fade quitely into memory, but history refuses to let me alone.|Vorian Atreides, The Legacy Journals, [[Kepler]] period}}
When the war hero Faykan Butler formed the new [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Imperium]], Vor began to feel a lack of interest. While he was granted permission to use his rank fo Supreme Bashar as long as he lived, he had no desire for further battle, and took his ship and a generous reward from the new Emperor, turned his back on the League of Nobles, and headed off for the frontier in an anonymous, solitary journey across the Known Universe in order to escape from his former military life, in a ship resembling the ''Dream Voyager'' which he ultimately christened the ''New Voyager.''

Vorian retreated on the backwater planet of [[Kepler]] where he lived in a settled valley with his second wife, [[Mariella Atreides]], who he married in 75 BG, and in the decades that followed, several generations of family members. In [[5 BG/XD|5 BG]], while Vorian was away, the residents of the valley capable of manual labor were seized by slavers from Poritrin. Vor killed several slavers, and tracked the slave ships to the city of [[New Starda]], where he bought and freed them before seeking revenge against their surviving captors.

=== Arrakis period {{C|5-4 BG}} ===
Vor traveled to meet with Emperor [[Salvador Corrino|Salvador Corrino I]], grandson of his former comrade, Viceroy Faykan Butler. Warmly welcomed by the Salusan populace, he was asked to take the throne from the Corrinos. Although he declined to do so, Salvador and his brother [[Roderick Corrino]] became nervous, fearing that Vor might incite a revolution against House Corrino. They demanded that he retreated into a deeper exile, and, in exchange, they would station Corrino military forces around Kepler. Vor agreed to this, and travelled to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. Unbeknownst to him, he was followed by [[Griffin Harkonnen]], the ambitious grandson of Abulurd. Griffin confronted Vor in a Zensunni Freemen sietch deep in the Arrakeen desert.

The Naib told Griffin and Vorian they had to [[Duel between Vorian Atreides and Griffin Harkonnen|fight]] to end their blood feud. During the fight, Griffin revealed to Vorian that his wife was dead, catching him off guard and ultimately getting him at his mercy, although he decided not to kill him out of honor, supposedly ending the feud and the two were placed in the desert. However, Vor was also being followed by the twins [[Hila]] and [[Andros]], two children of Agamemnon who had survived for years in an isolated robotic outpost. They eventually caught Vor in the desert, and killed Griffin. Pursuing Vor, attempting to convert him to their beliefs in a new Time of Titans, they awere swallowed with the sand around them when a sandworm arrived. Vor sent a message of condolence to Griffin's sister, [[Valya Harkonnen]], who spurnned the offer and planned revenge.

=== Climax of the Atreides-Harkonnen feud {{C|4 BG - 1 AG}} ===

==== Lankiveil & Caladan ====
Feeling guilty for Griffin's death, Vorian attempted to give at least some help to the struggling Harkonnen family by secretly giving a large infusion of funds to Sony and Verygl Harkonnen's whaling business which had been slowly losing power on [[Lankiveil]]. 

After this travel, Vorian travelled back to [[Caladan]] for the first time in decades to meet his descendants with Leronica, among whom were the young men [[Orry Atreides]], [[Shander Atreides]] and [[Willem Atreides]], who he met. Following Orry's marriage to [[Tula Harkonnen]], who had obscured her last name, she murdered him on their wedding night, per the orders of her elder sister, [[Mother Superior]] [[Valya Harkonnen]]. Vorian travelled back to Lankiveil with Willem, revealing to Sonya and Vergyl Harkonnen that he was Atreides. The parents revealed that Tula had gone to Chusuk, and there Willem attempted to kill her but Bene Gesserit protected her and brought her to Wallach IX.

==== Salusa Secundus & Corrin ====
Vorian went next to Salusa Secundus on a ship he christened the ''New Voyager'' to ask [[Roderick Corrino]], who had since become Emperor after being assassinated by [[Josef Venport]] on Arrakis, and who was currently dealing with the ongoing [[Butlerian War]], to accept Willem into a role in his court. He then told his operatives to wait for two weeks before spreading the rumor in the Imperial Court that he'd gone to Corrin, by which time he would have arrived and his preparations would be complete.

Coming back to Corrin gave Vorian great pain, as the place where he had spent much of his youth as a human trustee and also the location of the Battle of Corrin where Abulurd had betrayed the Army of Humanity during the crucial moment of the Bridge of Hrethgir. After inoculating himself against residual radiation from the old atomic attack, Vorian landed the ''New Voyager'' in a cleared area not far from the largest settlement. He donned protective filmgoggles against the harsh light of the sun, and emerged into what had once been the glorious machine capital.

After reaching the large settlement, Vorian introduced himself to a hard-bitten woman called Korla, the self-anointed Queen of Trash, who now served as planetary ruler and the leader of a group of scavengers. While Vor gave Korla his real name, because he wanted to be sure the Harkonnens could follow the clues, it was clear that neither Korla nor any of the other scavengers believed he was truly the legendary Hhero of the Jihad. That evening, Korla invited Vor to dine with her in an underground dwelling formed out of the frozen flowmetal to create a cavelike, sheltered place. 

Valya soon arrived on the planet. In her initial confrontation with Vorian, her [[Truthsayer]] Cindel attempted to tell her that he had in fact not killed Griffin after he once again affirmed this, but she dismissed this, thinking that he had tricked himself into thinking this or arranged his death without actually killing him.

Vorian then [[Duel between Vorian Atreides and Valya Harkonnen|fought]] Valya as Willem, who had in fact followed Vorian against his wishes, duelled Tula. Valya attempted to use a method of Voice on Vorian to freeze his muscles, but his mental strength was too strong for this. Valya attempted to protect Tula from Willem, who had nearly killed her, but Vorian prevented this by throwing himself against her. Willem did not kill her, however, as she revealed that she carried his brother's child. At the last moment, Korla arrived and also interfered, forcing an end to the fighting. Vorian left the planet and Valya believed him dead after his ship exploded, but he did in fact survive.

=== Aftermath {{C|Post 1 AG}} ===
Vorian was from this moment on believed to be dead by his Caladanian relatives, although in reality he survived and decided to once again begin a new life. Meanwhile, his relatives continued the Atreides-Harkonnen feud, Willem Atreides founding [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] itself in Vorian's honor and in opposition to [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]], which was gaining more and more power under [[Danvis Harkonnen]].

At some point after this, Vorian wrote ''[[Memoirs Without Shame]]'', ''[[Battle Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Turning Points in History]],'' as well as his extensive ''[[Legacy Journals]],'' which were published in the new Empire. 

== Relationships ==

=== Agamemnon ===
While a human trustee on Earth, Vorian held deep respect and great admiration for his father, the cymek General Agamemnon, viewing him through the Titans' propaganda of their great victories, which twisted the true facts of historical events. Agamemnon was also proud of his son and thought that finally he had produced offspring worthy of becoming a neo-cymek. After Vorian saved the Dream Voyager in 203 BG, Agamemnon was permitted by Omnius to give Vorian life extension treatment, which was incredibly painful for his son, making Vorian initially believe he was being punished. After Erasmus' house slave Serena Butler hinted to Vorian that his view of his father and the thinking machines was distorted, he looked into the true files and saw the true atrocities which Agamemnon had committed. 

This was one of the key factors that led to his realisation that he was on the wrong side and his change of loyalties during the Rebellion of Earth, betraying his father, who he had for so long admired. Following this and Vorian's serving in the Butlerian Jihad against the Synchronized Worlds, the General felt extremely vengeful against his son, wishing to keep him alive to punish him for his disobediance. Father and son reunited in battle multiple times but neither ever captured the other. When Agamemnon and the two remaining Titans, Juno and Dante, rebelled against Omnius, Agamemnon realized that he would be able to have no further children and Vorian was his only hope. Thus, when his son arrived on Hessra in 88 BG and claimed to have changed his loyalty once more to the Titans, the General was compelled to trust his son out of his secret hopes, although he feigned mistrust. 

At the last, when Vorian had his father and his former idol at his mercy, he decided not to give him an eternity of torture as Primero Quentin Butler wished in his vengeance, but a quick death, out of the last bit of mercy he held for the General, but also as a punishment in itself - Agamemnon would not die the glorious murder in battle he had long dreamed for, but in an unremarkable and utterly insignificant fashion. Vorian's father pleaded in his last moments for him to join him, saying that they could create a new Time of Titans together, but Vorian ignored these pleas and killed the Titan.

=== Later family ===
During his military career, Vorian had many relationships with different women on numerous planets such as [[Karida Julan]] and a lot of others. This ended when he landed on [[Caladan]] and fell in love with a barmaid named [[Leronica Tergiet]]. He fathered twins with Leronica, [[Estes]] and [[Kagin Atreides]]. Because of his role in the war, the kids grew with a surrogate father, [[Kalem Vazz]] but after his death, Vorian married Leronica and the kids learned their true heritage. However there was always a distance between father and sons and they broke off connections after Leronica's death.

Later he discovered he had also sired a daughter during a brief relationship on [[Parmentier]], who herself gave birth to [[Raquella Berto-Anirul]], the founder of the [[Bene Gesserit]].

=== Seurat ===
Vorian's closest companion on Earth was his fellow crewmember on the Dream Voyager, the independent robot Seurat, who attempted to learn more about humans through him and often told jokes to Vorian in an attempt to imitate a human sense of humor. Even when Vorian changed his loyalty to the humans who resisted the thinking machines, Seurat considered this nothing more than a bad practical joke, the same way he considered Vorian deactivating him during the Battle of Earth and stealing his Omnius update. 

When Vorian reawakened the independent robot decades later to spread his Omnius virus, Seurat continued to retain an affection for Vorian despite his clear new allegiance to the League of Nobles, and when he had the opportunity to kill Vorian a few years later, he decided against it after a verbal jest between the two. However, the independent robot was ultimately loyal to Omnius and the thinking machines, and finally betrayed Vorian during the Battle of Corrin by firing against him from the Dream Voyager.

=== Erasmus ===
On Earth, Vorian had a friendly but not very close relationship with the independent robot Erasmus, discussing Serena Butler with him when she was captured from Giedi Prime and brought to Earth as Erasmus' house slave. 

=== Serena Butler ===
When the Viceroy's daughter Serena Butler was captured from the liberation of Giedi Prime and brought to Earth as Erasmus' house slave, Vorian felt his first ever true feeling of love towards her, despite her initial disgust at a human who willingly held alleigance to the thinking machines. Serena was the root inspiration of his change of loyalties to the League of Nobles, telling him that he was being fed a distorted version of the history of the Titans, and that he was a slave who did not see his own chains. 

However, Vorian saw after not long on Salusa Secundus that a romantic relationship between them would be impossible, although over the years he did become good friends with both her and her former love Xavier Harkonnen, who along with Vorian was the first to know of Serena's true intentions by travelling to Corrin as a supposed envoy to the Synchronized Worlds in 164 BG through a message which the Priestess sent to the two men who had once loved her.

=== Xavier Harkonnen ===
Vorian first met Xavier Harkonnen following the liberation of Giedi Prime when he was still loyal to Omnius and was delivering an Omnius update to Giedi Prime, deciding to trick the Tercero into thinking the Dream Voyager was a stolen machine ship and that he was a League human before escaping swiftly, the action which earned him the reward of life extension treatment by his father. They reunited after the return of Vorian, Serena Butler and Iblis Ginjo to Salusa Secundus, and despite the naturally bitter feelings that continued between them they eventually became good friends, both being promoted to the rank of Primero (although Xavier technically outranked Vorian by one level). 

When Xavier sacrificed himself to kill Grand Patriarch Iblis Ginjo in 164 BG, he decided to send word to Vorian on Caladan, as he was the one who he trusted most. In the years following Xavier's death, Vorian was regretful that the truth about Xavier had to be withheld from the public, replaced by propaganda of a vile traitorous man who had killed the noble Grand Patriarch, but recognised that if he tried with any effort to convince the people of the truth of the actual events it would turn attention away from the real enemy of the evermind Omnius. Although Vorian convinced Viceroy Faykan Butler to set up a task force to look into the truth surrounding Xavier in order to clear his name, this was disbanded after Vorian observed that the actions of Xavier's grandson Abulurd at the Bridge of Hrethgir which caused his disgrace made this impossible.

=== Abulurd Harkonnen ===
In the later years of the Butlerian Jihad, Vorian developed a friendship with Abulurd Butler almost as great as that he had once had with his grandfather Xavier Harkonnen, especially as he was the only of Xavier's grandchildren to truly have any respect for the truth about their grandfather and devotion to one day clearing his name one day after Vorian revealed the truth to them, Abulurd being told last in 108 BG. When Abulurd retook the name Harkonnen, Vorian was one of the few to respect and even approve of this brave decision, although he also noted in a private conversation that it was also foolhardy and was bound to set Abulurd's career back. 

After participating in the Great Purge which ended the jihad together, they fought the pirahna mites which were sent from Corrin to Salusa Secundus nineteen years later, which resulted in Vorian proudly promoting his good friend's grandson. The relationship between Vorian and Abulurd was, however, finally ruined during the Battle of Corrin, in which Abulurd not only argued with his commander and friend to at the last refuse to allow the billions of human captives at the Bridge of Hrethgir to die, a decision which Vorian viewed as completely necessary, but sabotaged the weapons of the Vengeance Fleet to delay their passing of the Bridge, an action which in the end did not actually kill anyone due to the concurrent sabotage of the independent robot Erasmus on Corrin. This was perhaps the most tragic part of the betrayal - its absolute uselesness due to Erasmus' successful sabotage. 

Following the human victory at the Battle, Vorian was the one to recommend that Abulurd not be executed for treason but exiled to the distant world of Lankiveil for cowardice, which he told Abulurd he thought was indeed a worst fate, especially as Abulurd had once privately vowed to Vorian that he would never be a coward. Vorian refused to look at Abulurd during the trial or during his confrontation with his former friend before his being sent to Lankiveil, viewing his betrayal as one not only of his military duties but of their friendship, and declaring that from that day on the name of Atreides would spit on the name of Harkonnen, all of the Harkonnens on Lankiveil being forced to keep the disgraced name, although this was an extent of Vorian's anger which he later regretted and attempted to reconcile by helping the Harkonnen family retain power in the whale fur economy of Lankiveil in 3 BG.

=== Valya Harkonnen ===
Vorian was the one person in the Known Universe who Valya Harkonnen, great-granddaughter of Abulurd Harkonnen, hated the most, as he had caused her family's downfall during the Battle of Corrin. Her hatred for Vorian led to her wish to eliminate all of the Atreides, repeatedly putting this plan above her loyalty to the Sisterhood due to her rage towards him. One of the main reasons why Valya spent a year training as a Swordmaster at the Ginaz School was because she wished to use these skills in her upcoming fight with Vorian. The rest of Valya's family were significantly less passionate in their hatred for Vorian and all of the Atreides, most of all her parents and her uncle, but did not attempt to stop her from pursuing her vengeance against him and his family.

'''Thufir Hawat''' ([[10075 AG]] - [[10193 AG]]) was a [[Mentat]] and [[Master of Assassins]] for [[House Atreides]] during the time of Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto the Just]].

For three generations, Hawat had been responsible for Atreides House security. This meant protection for Atreides family members, anti-espionage, risk management, and various aspects of [[kanly]]. Moreover, Hawat had been entrusted with the training of the Ducal Heir [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] in the arts of war, as well as political and military strategy.

Throughout the Imperium, Hawat had a formidable reputation. He was known in the [[Landsraad]] to be both cunning and honourable. Indeed, other Great Houses coveted him for his abilities as a strategist, warrior, and trusted advisor.

==History==
===The Move to Arrakis ===
When House Atreides was ordered to take over the planetary fief of [[Arrakis]] by the Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], Hawat served as one of the principal advisors to the Duke Leto throughout the entire transition. While the Atreides were in the process of consolidating their rule over the planet, Hawat was charged with the security of the royal compound in the city of Arrakeen, where the Atreides based their capital. During this time, Hawat saw his abilities and reputation tested when Harkonnen agents, left behind by the Baron Harkonnen, tried to assassinate the ducal heir, Paul. However, despite Hawat offering his resignation, the Duke saw this only as a learning experience for the Mentat, advising Hawat to see it this way also, and thus kept him in his service.

Shortly after their arrival on Arrakis, the Duke ordered Hawat to coordinate a raid on [[Giedi Prime]], the Harkonnen homeworld, in order to destroy the (supposedly secret) [[spice melange|spice]] hoards the Baron Harkonnen kept there for the purpose of resale. The raid was both daring and successful, and provided a morale boost to the homesick Atreides army, which had been uncertain about its future after the move from their ancestral home of [[Caladan]], and it served to prepare the troops for the looming war with [[House Harkonnen]], which both Hawat and the Duke were certain would come swiftly. It also demonstrated the quality of Atreides military intelligence. Most importantly, it struck at the very heart of House Harkonnen, and served as further example to the [[Landsraad]] of Atreides courage and audacity. Perhaps most brilliant of all however, was that, much to the Baron's ire, House Harkonnen could not exact retribution because the Emperor had deemed such spice hoarding as highly illegal.

In part due to the destruction of Harkonnen spice stockpiles, Hawat knew the Harkonnens would not abandon the lucrative and exclusive spice mining operations on Arrakis. Moreover, Hawat also knew that both the Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor had eyed Duke Leto Atreides with envy because of his popularity in the Landsraad. Hawat surmised - quite rightly - that if the Harkonnens were to attack Arrakis, that [[House Corrino]] would tacitly provide help, most likely in the form of Imperial [[Sardaukar]] legions, disguised in Harkonnen uniforms. Unfortunately, despite having made such an accurate analysis, as he would soon discover, Hawat had seriously underestimated how many troops the Emperor would send; Hawat's estimation was that the Emperor would send a maximum of two brigades of Sardaukar to aid the Harkonnens. The Emperor sent fifty.

A constantly suspicious man, but one who loved the Atreides, Hawat was hyper-vigilant in his protection of Atreides family members. Unfortunately, though he knew that there was a traitor in the Atreides household, Hawat mistakenly believed it to be the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]]. Even after the successful Harkonnen/Corrino attack on Arrakis, which saw House Atreides defeated, Hawat still believed that Jessica had been the one who betrayed them, instead of [[Wellington Yueh|Dr. Wellington Yueh]]. This was in no small part due to the Baron Harkonnen feeding Hawat false information.

It was during the attack when Hawat had come to discover the true abilities of the [[Fremen]]. At one stage, Hawat and approximately twenty Atreides troops under his command were holed up in a cave while retreating from the Harkonnen/Sardaukar advance. Through a bond he had formed with a Fremen warrior, Hawat came to observe a skirmish between a dozen Sardaukar and a few Fremen where, after the dust had settled, only the Fremen remained standing. Moreover, Hawat also observed that a [[troop carrier]] filled with approximately 300 Sardaukar soldiers was destroyed, killing all 300 soldiers, when a Fremen flying an [[ornithopter]] made a kamikaze run at the carrier. It was through these actions that Hawat came to realise - belatedly - that the Fremen were a formidable force that could have been a powerful ally for his Duke.

===In Harkonnen Service===
After the Harkonnens replaced House Atreides as rulers of Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen took Thufir Hawat prisoner and forced him into his service. This was done by introducing a poison into Hawat's blood, for which only the Harkonnens maintained the antidote. Baron Harkonnen saw this as a personal victory, because of Hawat's reputation, because Hawat had foiled many of the Baron's plans against the Atreides, and because the Baron's own Mentat, [[Piter de Vries]], had been killed by Duke Leto just before he died.

While in the service of the Harkonnens, Hawat used his considerable talents to manipulate the Harkonnens to some degree, through political manoeuvring and assassination. Hawat had attempted to create a rift between the Baron and his nephew, [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]], by using a captive Atreides warrior as a means to kill Feyd in the [[gladiator]] ring. While Hawat knew the plan would ultimately fail because of the unfair advantage Feyd would give himself, the warrior had almost succeeded. Instead of facing a drugged slave, Hawat arranged for Feyd to confront a trained Atreides soldier with his capacities fully intact. As a result, the Baron's game trainer was executed for putting Feyd in danger, which left the position vacant to be filled by one of Feyd's men.

For approximately two years Hawat remained in the service of the Harkonnens, plotting and scheming in subtle ways, ultimately hoping to seek revenge against those who killed his "beloved Duke", as well as against whom he believed to be the Traitor, the Lady Jessica. Moreover, Hawat took the defeat of the Atreides as a personal failure, and therefore believed that if he continued to scheme and manipulate inside the Harkonnen House, as well as exact revenge against the traitor, he may be able to redeem himself in some way. Indeed, Hawat very nearly brought down the Harkonnens from within, playing the ambitions of the [[na-Baron]] Feyd-Rautha against his uncle. These schemes underscored the deadly cunning of Hawat, who had clearly earned his legendary reputation as a formidable political and military operative.

===Hawat's Death ===
In 10,193 Leto's son Paul managed to restore House Atreides to power over Arrakis and ultimately wrested the [[Golden Lion Throne]] from the [[House Corrino|Corrinos]]. Upon discovering that Hawat had been unknowingly working against Paul under the service of Baron Harkonnen, Hawat committed suicide. He felled himself on a poison needle hidden in his left hand meant for Paul. Paul had offered him his own life for all of Hawat's service to House Atreides. Hawat, rather than kill the son of his beloved Duke, gave his life for the Atreides one last time.
For two years Hawat had been working for the Harkonnens, helping them fight a [[Fremen]] leader named [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] who had led an insurgency on Arrakis, only to realise that Muad'Dib was Paul himself, son of his beloved Duke. At that point, the great Thufir Hawat passed into legend.

== Physical Appearance ==
Thufir Hawat was described as a grizzled elderly man with brown eyes, cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, and lips stained red by sapho juice.

==Appearances==
*''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' <small>(First appearance)</small>

== Behind the Scenes ==
*Thufir Hawat was portrayed by actor Freddie Jones in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 Dune movie]]. His death scene was filmed, but deleted from the final cut of the film. 
*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCbR0wZWJxQ In that scene], Thufir is given a blade by Feyd-Rautha in order to assassinate Paul in exchange for an antidote. As in the book, Paul realises this with his precognition and offers his life to Thufir in exchange for his long service to House Atreides. Instead of stabbing himself, Thufir pulls out his own heart plug, managing to utter "Three generations of...you..." towards Paul before dying in his arms.
*Jan Vlasák played Thufir Hawat in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 Dune miniseries]]. In that adaptation, Hawat apparently was not captured by the Harkonnens. His last appereance was in Arrakeen, swearing. It is believable that he was killed in the battle.
*Stephen McKinley Henderson plays Thufir Hawat in the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 ''Dune'' film]].

Gurney Halleck
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{Character infobox

 |house=[[Atreides]]
 |eyes= Blue in blue
 |hair=Blonde
 |height=
 |book name=|birth=10130s AG|debut=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]}}
'''Gurney Halleck''' [b. 10130s AG] was [[Warmaster]] for [[House Atreides]] during the reign of [[Leto Atreides I]], and then his son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. Later, he was both the Earl of Caladan and Siridar-Baron of Giedi Prime.

Along with [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Duncan Idaho]], Halleck was one of Paul's principal teachers during his early years on [[Caladan]]. He was a ruthless, yet noble and romantic warrior of enormous talent. Described as ''"an ugly lump of a man"'', he was regarded the most loyal of friends to those he loved, and to those he hated there were few enemies more terrifying. A traditionalist and purist at heart, Gurney Halleck did not indulge in melange addiction or other methods to prolong human life.

Halleck was a talented minstrel who was skilled in the use of the [[baliset]]. He would often play music on this instrument to entertain his guests, or to fill the dining halls of House Atreides with music when he was in their service. Moreover, Halleck was also fond of spouting verse from the Orange Catholic Bible, and would frequently find an appropriate verse for almost every situation. At times his quotations were so appropriate that they were nearly prophetic.

Halleck's fighting abilities were second to none. In a fight against Gurney with [[sword]] or [[knife]], few opponents lasted more than a few moments, including even battle-hardened [[Sardaukar]]. Gurney was also skilled at various other weapons, and astonished [[Fremen]] later saw that he could adapt to his environment, as witnessed by the fact that he taught himself to ride sandworms as they did.

However, it was the way in which Halleck managed to fuse the minstrel and warrior that made him so unique. According to [[Duncan Idaho]]: ''"He could be killing you while he was singing and never miss a note."''

==Appearance==
Gurney Halleck was an ugly lump of a man with brawny arms and long-fingered hands with large thumbs.  He had wispy blond hair that trailed over barren spots on his forehead, and a lumpy face with flat features, a too-round nose, a lumpy chin, and blue glass-splinter eyes.

==History==
===Life with House Atreides===
Gurney found service with House Atreides on [[Caladan]] during the rule of Leto I, who had rescued him from the Harkonnen [[slave]]-pits. Gurney had a deep hatred for the Harkonnens, especially [[Glossu Rabban]], who had murdered his sister, Bheth Halleck.  He eventually became [[Warmaster]] and a loyal friend to Duke Leto Atreides and his concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]]. When Leto and Jessica had a son, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], Halleck would serve as one of Paul's instructors in war and hand-to-hand combat.

Lady Jessica, who knew him so well, recalled in him an epigram written on the wall of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra Muslim palace] in the country of Spain, which once existed on [[Old Earth]]. She called him ''Gurney The Valorous'' from the Islamic ode:

:''"There are four pillars which support the world...the wisdom of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous, and the valor of the brave."''

===Life on Arrakis===
Three years later, like the entire Atreides staff, Halleck accompanied the Duke and his family to Arrakis. Unlike some other Atreides lieutenants, such as Duncan Idaho, Halleck survived the fall of the Atreides on [[Arrakis]]. In the years after the attack, he fell in with [[Smuggler|spice smugglers]], eventually becoming a powerful figure, both in their ranks and on Arrakis in general. Approximately two years after the fall of the Duke Leto, Halleck and his smugglers fell for a Fremen trap - a fake hoard of spice - and were almost killed before Paul, who had now become the Fremen leader [[Muad'Dib]], recognized him among the smugglers. Upon returning to [[Sietch Tabr]] with Paul, Halleck almost killed the Lady Jessica, because he was under the mistaken impression (as others were) that she was responsible for the betrayal of House Atreides to House Harkonnen.

After the deposition of Shaddam IV and Paul's ascension to the Golden Lion Throne, Paul handed Gurney the fief of [[Caladan]], making Gurney an [[Earl]]. The title of Earl — during various periods of history — was equivalent to Duke. At other times, it was equivalent to Count. In some countries (such as Scandinavian term "jarl"), it was the equivalent of sovereign prince. Thus, it is possible that Paul was, in effect, giving his only surviving non blood related Atreides friend the same noble rank that he and his father once held, albeit by a different name.

===Friend of Jessica===
It was said that during this time, when Paul was Emperor, Gurney Halleck became the lover of the Lady Jessica, although the two of them kept their relationship out of the public eye to avoid scandal. It would appear that Halleck spent the remainder of his days assisting the Lady Jessica in ruling Caladan.

Halleck still retained the title of Baron of Giedi Prime, and as well as outlawing slavery on the world, the ecologically improved the entire infrastructure on the planet, with the help of the Caladani people. Included in this massive project was the reseeding of natural flora and fauna, as well as the renaming of places and cities.
===After Paul's Death===
{{Stub}}In [[10219 AG]], Halleck was sent by Jessica to infiltrate [[Sietch Jacurutu|Jacurutu]], where her grandson, [[Leto Atreides II]], was captured. On Gurney's suggestion, Leto was forced to undergo the spice trance. 
==Other Accounts==
Gurney Halleck was most recently explored in the ''Dune'' prequels written by [[Brian Herbert]], [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] son, and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. In their prequels Halleck's early life, in which he originated on the House Harkonnen world of Giedi Prime, is detailed. In this version, Gurney was born into the slave caste of Giedi Prime along with his sister [[Bheth]]. When he once challenged acting slavemaster Glossu Rabban, he was tortured and received his characteristic inkvine scar. After escaping the local militia--who also had killed his sister--he fled the planet and entered the service of House Vernius before entering the service of Duke Leto.

According to the ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia|DUNE ENCYCLOPEDIA]]'', on the other hand, Gurney was born into a house minor of Chusuk with his brother Kyle and sister Annette, being originally trained a manufacturer of Balisets. When Chusuk was attacked by Harkonnen forces, Gurney and Annette were captured and Gurney was sent to the slave pits, while his sister was dispatched to the Harkonnen troop's pleasure houses. Gurney survived for eleven years and eventually was freed by an Atreides raid on Giedi Prime in which many slaves were freed and brought to Caladan, where Gurney chose to enter the service of his saviour the Duke. Though Gurney rose quickly through the ranks he was not able to rescue his sister. One day, more than twenty years after his imprisonment, he learned from an Atreides agent that a Harkonnen officer had murdered Annette just on her first day at the Harkonnen facility; she had at least been spared a life of brutalization. 

==Behind the Scenes ==
Alejandro Jorodowski wanted Hervé Villechaize to portray Gurney Halleck in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''. Villechaize is famous for his role as Tattoo in the American series ''Fantasy Island.''

In David Lynch's film version of ''Dune'', Gurney was portrayed by Patrick Stewart, while in the Sci-Fi Channel mini-series, the role was played by P. H. Moriarty. In the 2021 adaptation by Denis Villeneuve, he was portrayed by Josh Brolin.

The quote by Duncan Idaho regarding Gurney comes from ''[[Heretics of Dune (novel)|Heretics of Dune]]''. The Idaho [[ghola]] recalled Gurney soon after his [[genetic memory]] was awakened by [[Miles Teg]].

Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)
{{Original}}

{{disambigLink|[[Paul Atreides]]|Muad'Dib}}

[[File:Muaddib.png|thumb|The mouse shadow in the second moon]]

'''Muad'Dib''' was the name adopted by [[Paul Atreides]] after he was accepted by the [[Fremen]] as one of their own.

== Symbolism ==
The symbolic definition is broader in complexity. It is part the chosen name of manhood that [[Paul Atreides]] selects when he is accepted into the Fremen. It is one of two names that Paul maintains within the tribe. [[Stilgar]] explains that the first, Usul, means "strength of the base of the pillar". That it is his secret name, his troop name, that only Sietch Tabr may use and none other may presume.

The second name, Muad'Dib, is that by which he is known openly. Paul took the name from the small mouse of the desert and his choice pleased and impressed Stilgar, as well as other Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]].

{{quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib.|Stilgar|Dune}}
The English pronunciation of this word calls for a short "i", there is an almost identical word in Arabic, مُؤَدِّب ''mu'addib'', which means "private tutor" or "teacher". It used to be that the Caliphs, the rulers of the Muslim world, would hire a ''mu'addib'' to teach their children. The practice seemed to be common for other strata of society as well.

== Paul-Muad'Dib ==

Paul is reluctant to throw away his full past and get rid of the full name his father gave him, which is why he first wished to be called Paul-Muad'Dib. Unfortunately, this name was soon forgotten and became simply "Muad'dib". Also, it was hoped that by keeping the name his father gave him, he could prevent the mass slaughter that would occur later in his name. Sadly, he could not.

The meanings of both Usul and Muad'Dib have powerful ramifications and foreshadowing for the purpose Paul has on Arrakis.

After escaping the successful invasion of [[Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen]], and proving their value to the [[Fremen]], [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and his mother [[Jessica Atreides]] were accepted into [[Sietch Tabr]] by the [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]].

[[Paul Atreides|Paul]] was instructed to take a [[Fremen]] word as his new name. While lost in the deep desert prior to being intercepted by [[Stilgar]] and his clan, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] had spotted a small but nimble creature foraging on a rock outcrop. The creature had been a [[desert mouse]]. Upon asking the name of the creature, and being told it was called ''"Muad'Dib"'' by the [[Fremen]], he chose it as his new name.

[[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] choice in name was also marginally influenced by the prescient visions he had begun to have after arriving on [[Arrakis]]. In one recurring vision he saw throngs of [[Fremen]] chanting the word ''"Muad'Dib"'' at him in a subservient manner.

'''Duncan Idaho''' was originally a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Ginaz Swordmaster]] in the service of the honorable [[House Atreides]] during the last days of the [[Corrino Empire]], and one of the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]]'s right-hand men, with [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat]], and regarded as something of a ladies' man.

After falling in the [[Desert War]] on [[Arrakis]], he grew in importance from this relatively obscure role through a series of [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[ghola]] incarnations over the next five thousand years, first playing a key role as a Mentat in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|the final plot]] against [[Padishah Emperor|Pa]] n becoming the husband of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]], which was followed by his time as the [[Commander]] of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]]'s forces, and finally as an important figure in [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|the war]] between the [[Bene Gesserit]] and [[Honored Matres]].

== Biography ==
=== Original life {{C|?-10191}} ===
{{Quote|Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldier. Atreides field-hand on the field of battle.|[[Bijaz]] describing ther original Duncan to [[Hayt]]|Dune Messiah}}

==== Early life  ====
Duncan was born and raised on [[Giedi Prime]].<ref name=":5">[[Heretics of Dune|''Heretics of Dune'']], Chapter 3 (''Bene Gesserit Analysis'') - "Gammu . . . the original Duncan Idaho was born and raised there."</ref> His sister died there as a victim of the Harkonnens.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 5 - "“Your sister died there, a victim of the Harkonnens".</ref> He was rescued from Harkonnen bondage by the [[Old Duke|Old Duke Atreides]]<ref>''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', Chapter 31 (''Songs of Gurney Halleck'') - "Duncan saw only the face of the Old Duke telling him to obey. It was too much."</ref> and came under the service of the Atreides on [[Caladan]] after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens. He was then trained on [[Ginaz]] where he graduated as a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 4 (''Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries'') - "There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz..."</ref><ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', Chapter 3 (''Tleilaxu Theorem'') - "The body was sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz School."</ref>

==== Atreides service  ====
The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], the concubine of the Old Duke's son [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgment was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with the Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]], a man who was also rescued from Giedi Prime by the Old Duke. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education. 

===== War of Assassins with Grumman =====
At some point, a [[War of Assassins]] [[War of Assassins of Houses Ginaz and Moritani|ignited]] between [[House Ginaz]] and [[House Moritani]], the ruling class of the planet [[Grumman]], in which he emperors of [[House Corrino]], particularly [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], supported House Moritani, and [[House Atreides]] supported House Ginaz.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', "Terminology of the Imperium"</ref> This war was Duncan's first real experience in mortal combat and was where he first killed, slaying a Harkonnen.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 17 (''The Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib'') - "My sword was firs’ blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon ... Harkon ... killed ’im f’r th’ Duke."</ref>
[[File:Dune 2020 Duncan Idaho.jpg|thumb|Duncan as Atreides Swordmaster]]

=====Move to Arrakis  =====
Later, when the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief under the order of the [[Emperor|Padishah Emperor]] in [[10191 AG]], Idaho went a week early to the desert planet to lead the second wave onto the planet.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 4 (''A Child's History of Muad'Dib'')</ref> Encountering [[Stilgar|Naib Stilgar]] and [[Sietch Tabr]], he later became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 12 (''Manual of Muad'Dib'')</ref>

===== Death =====
When the Emperor launched [[Siege of Arrakeen|an attack]] on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho escaped the massacre. He initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes, Lady Jessica and Paul, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar.<ref name=":0">''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Chapter 25 (''Arrakis Awakening'')</ref>

Duncan was killed by one by a blow to the head, but not before he dispatched no less than nineteen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly.<ref>''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]'', Chapter 32 (''Stilgar’s Report to the Landsraad Commission'') - "The Sardaukar who’d slain him reported his prowess: nineteen of their number dispatched by Idaho before he’d fallen."</ref> In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], allowing them to escape in an ornithopter.<ref name=":0" />
===First rebirth {{C|10196-10219}}===
After Paul's ascension to the throne in [[10196 AG]], Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]], a clone made by the [[Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as '[[Hayt]]' in his ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', Chapter 6 (''The Emperor Paul Muad’dib'')</ref>

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In the ensuing trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a [[Bene Tleilax]] plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], but only if he abdicated his throne.<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]],'' Chapter 23 (''Children's Verse'')</ref>

====Second death====
[[File:Dune stilgar wierds out on duncan|thumb|Duncan confronts Stilgar shortly before his second death]]
Idaho married [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], in 10210. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. 

In 10219, in order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed [[Javid]], Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Duncan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.<ref>''[[Children of Dune]]'', Chapter 55 (''The Story of Liet-Kynes'')</ref>

=== Incarnations under Leto II {{C|10219-13728}} ===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for 3,508 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times, and as leader of the [[Fish Speakers]]. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience and memories of all his ancestors, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The [[ego-memories]] of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.
[[File:Duncangod.webp|thumb|Duncan in the chambers of the God Emperor]]
The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of religious tyranny and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm). 

Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes".<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 7 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref> In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself, and in at least one instance he died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin - in another, he died under a Sardaukar sword, when Leto still used them as his fighting force. In one anomalous occasion, Idaho died in a 'thopter crash.<ref>''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', Chapter 42 (''Ancient Drinking Toast'')</ref> In another even rarer occasion, Duncan had accidentally blew himself up after an attempt on Leto's life which he abandoned when the Emperor convinced him he was doing the wrong, causing him to toss the explosive, in which the materials were unstable, to the side.<ref name=":1">''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 5 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" since most Duncans only possessed the memories of the original Idaho. If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.

==== Suppression of Wallach IX ====
In 13650, Duncan was charged by Leto to travel to [[Wallach IX|Wallach IX,]] where he would extinguish the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on the planet in order to enforce Leto's ban of the ancient [[Order of Mentats]]. This brought him great pain, as he, a Mentat, was forced to suppress a school that trained people the way he was trained. 

During the suppression, he talked to Sister Tersius Helen Anteac, one of the Mentat trainees<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Chapter 27 (''The Coda'')</ref> who escaped the planet shortly after, renaming herself Tertius Eileen Anteac, under the name of which she would later try and kill the God Emperor. Other Mentat-Sisters escaped as well, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood. This incarnation of Duncan died just ten years after the suppression.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 17 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

==== Penultimate Incarnation under Leto ====
In his penultimate incarnation still serving the God Emperor, the one after his life in which he suppressed Wallach IX, Duncan had two children with the Fish Speaker [[Irti]] in [[Shuloch|Goygoa]]; one in 13712, and another in 13720.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 26 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref> In 13727 he made his last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun supplied to him by the Ixian Ambassador [[Iyo Kobat]]. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him.<ref name=":1" />

==== Last incarnation in Leto's service ====
After this last time in which he was killed by the God Emperor, a new Duncan was given to Leto by the Bene Tleilax in 13728. This Duncan fell in love with Siona Atreides, a girl hidden from prescience who rebelled against Leto, and became good friends with Siona's father and Leto's majordomo, Moneo Atreides, despite Moneo easily beating him in combat and thus shaming him later on.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 41 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

Ultimately, Duncan joined a final attempt on Leto's life with Siona and her assistant and co-conspirator Nayla. During the God Emperor's wedding with his love, the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree, Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by Nayla. Leto, Hwi and Moneo fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]], named after Duncan In dying, the God Emperor released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 53 (''The Stolen Journals'')</ref>

===== After Leto's Death =====
After the assassination, Duncan had nine daughters and a thousand sons with Siona - these children and these children's children, and so on, were hidden from prescience. The significant descendants of these many children, which were said to have "Siona blood", meaning they were shrouded from the prescient vision, included [[Hadi Benotto]]<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', Chapter 54 (''Excerpt from the Hadi Benotto secret summation on the discoveries at Dar-es-Balat'')</ref>, [[Darwi Odrade]], [[Lucilla]]<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Chapter 6 (''Leto II (The Tyrant)'') - “I have Siona blood. He cannot see me.”</ref>, [[Miles Teg]] and [[Sheeana Brugh]]. Duncan and Siona also inherited a portion of Leto's empire, which rapidly detoriorated into the [[Famine Times]] and the [[Scattering]].

Ultimately, long after the death of this incarnation, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola, born in 15216, survived.

===Final incarnation {{C|15216-15240}} ===
====On Gammu====
In 15229, on Gammu (formerly Giedi Prime), Duncan fled to an old Harkonnen no-globe with Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit [[bashar/XD|Bashar]], and Reverend Mother Lucilla, after an attack on the Bene Gesserit Gammu Keep. Miles Teg was commissioned to restore Duncan's memories, and managed to do so. Duncan, Teg and Lucilla were ambushed during an operation with the general Burzmali. Teg was captured but Duncan managed to escape with Lucilla.

When [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matre]], tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play when he overwhelmed Murbella in combat, and all of the memories of the hundreds of previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released. Duncan and Lucilla were located by Miles Teg and brough to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella in a no-ship. Duncan, Murbella, Lucilla, Sheeana Brugh, Darwi Odrade and Tleilaxu Master Scytale were put in the no-ship with a sandworm while Teg launched [[Battle of Rakis|a final suicidal defense of Rakis]].

==== Imprisoned on Chapterhouse ====
[[File:Chapter.jpg|thumb|Duncan was imprisoned inside a no-ship on Chapterhouse for ten years.]]
After the destruction of Rakis, the no-ship was brough to Chapterhouse in a no-ship, which became their prison, as well as Scytale's, by the Bene Gesserit. Over the next ten years, Murbella and Idaho sired four children. Idaho was then used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola. By this time, he had been allied with Reverend Mother [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] for some time, who stole the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Over the decade he spent imprisoned within the no-ship, he had continous visions of a pair of mysterious and powerful elderly-looking entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] and something he began to call [[Net, the|"the Net]]". He deducted that these beings had found a new way to apply the ancient theories of [[Holtzman]], and was almost certain they were the [[Ones of Many Faces]] who had chased the Matres back into the Old Empire.

==== Escape from Chapterhouse ====
In 15240, after Murbella became both Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit and Great Honoured Matre of the Honoured Matres, and began the combination of the two groups,  Duncan escaped with his ward, [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] and others aboard the no-ship into unchartered space to escape from the now-combined Gesserit/Matres group, the [[New Sisterhood]]. Exhibiting [[prescience]] abilities, Idaho was the only person that could see the net that Daniel and Marty cast to ensare the no-ship. To escape this net, Duncan Idaho deleted all of the navigation records of the no-ship, rendering those onboard truly lost. Duncan and the others' fate from this point remains unknown.

== Abilities and skills ==
''Note:'' As originally the memories of each rebirth of Duncan would pick up with his death on Arraksi, some incarnations had abilities which others did not. All of the following, however, were possessed by his final incarnation, who regained the memories of all of his previous lives.

* '''Swordfighting''': Duncan was trained as a Ginaz Swordmaster, which made him an adept at swordfighting, giving the Atreides a great warrior. Duncan's abilities in this area were demonstrated in multiple instances, perhaps the most notable being his killing of a full nineteen Sardaukar, the finest warriors in the Imperium, in a short time before his first death. This was one of the many motivations of the original taking of his cells by the Emperor's warriors, as well as one of the reasons why the God Emperor appointed him as Commander of his forces and continously brought him back and why the Bene Gesserit continued to resurrect him after Leto II's death. 
* '''Resistance to [[Voice/XD|Voice]]''': In his original lifetime, Duncan was taught by Paul Atreides the techniques used to resist the Bene Gesserit Voice of command, an ability which gave the Sisterhood less power over him, such as when the Reverend Mother Lucilla tried and failed to use Voice on Duncan in his final incarnation on Gammu.
* '''[[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] training''': In his first rebirth as the ghola Hayt, Duncan was trained by the Bene Tleilax as a Mentat in addition to a Zensunni philosopher. The God Emperor later trained him as a Mentat in a few of his later incarnations.
* '''[[Truthsayer]]''': Leto II also trained him as a Truthsayer in a few of his lives.

== Relationships ==

=== Paul Atreides ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Duncan had a close bond with his beloved Duke's son Paul, who he taught in swordfighting from his earliest years, and Paul was greatly distraught when he fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis, saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, Paul found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Stilgar ===
{{Quote|Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho. The body of [[Turok | our friend]] remains with [[Leto Atreides I | your Duke]]. His water is [[House Atreides | Atreides]] water. It is a bond between us.|Stilgar shortly after the agreemenet of Duncan's duel alleigance|Dune (novel)}}When Duncan was sent by the Duke Leto to make contact with the Fremen, the first he befriended was Stilgar, Naib of Sietch Tabr, which was the first sietch which Duncan found. In the relatively short time the two knew each other, they grew great respect for each other, Stilgar aknowledging that Duncan measured well in his sietch and observed the customs and honor among the Fremen people. Because of this, when Stilgar met the Duke Leto they agreed that Duncan would have duel alleigance to the Atreides and the Fremen. 

Eighteen years later, when Duncan's first ghola Hayt was presented to Paul, Stilgar initially mistrusted Hayt, declaring that Duncan was dead and this was not him, but ultimately grew a new friendship with the ghola, which grew even deeper when Hayt's memories were restored. At the last, however, Stilgar and Duncan were enemies once more; after Duncan murdered Javid and gave Stilgar the three greatest Fremen insults, he was forced by his honor to finally kill Idaho, an act which Duncan nevertheless called the right choice and one which forced him to subsequently move against the Regent Alia.

=== Bijaz ===
{{Quote|We are like brothers. We grew in the same [[axlotl tank | tank]]: I first and then you.|Bijaz describes his connection with Duncan while imprisoned in [[Arrakeen]]|Dune Messiah (novel)}}
Duncan first met the dwarf Bijaz as Hayt, before he regained his original memories. He took an instant dislike to him, mistrusting the dwarf and being wary in his presence and particularly distraught at Bijaz's provocative use of his original name of Duncan Idaho. However, Hayt and Bijaz also had a fundemental connection in that they had been grown in the same Tleilaxu axolotl tank, making Bijaz compare them to brothers.

During Hayt's conversation with Bijaz after their initial meeting, the ghola noted that he radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observor think of ancient idols and threatened to order a guard to strangle him in an attempt to indimiate the dwarf, who also was not fond of Hayt, calling him a callous lout. When Hayt asked what Bijaz planned to do with him, he said that he would do him a simple kindness. Following the reawakening of Duncan's memories in Hayt, Paul ordered him to kill Bijaz before he succumbed to the Tleilaxu plan, and Duncan obeyed without hesitation, saying that he had been the one to do Bijaz the 'kindness.'

=== Moneo Atreides ===
Over many ghola incarnations in the latter days of the reign of Leto II, the God Emperor's majordomo Moneo Atreides grew a great affection for Duncan, although after each rebirth Duncan experienced meeting Moneo all over again. Duncan's last incarnation under Leto II, the one which assassinated him, was at one point easily bested by Moneo in combat, embarrassing him and creating somewhat bitter feelings between them, although the majordomo later apologised.

=== Schwangyu ===
During the long training of his final incarnation in the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu, Duncan had many Bene Gesserit teachers, but he despised none above the Reverend Mother Schwangyu, who was a member of the faction who opposed Mother Superior Tararza and also became a traitor to the Sisterhood for the Bene Tleilax. He eventually repeated the private mantra, 'Damn Schwangyu!', and showed little if any regret for her murder by Honored Matres when the Keep was attacked.

== Behind the scenes ==

* Idaho is portrayed by the late [[America|American]] actor [[Richard Jordan]] in the [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film adaption]] of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. 
* [[James Watson]] portrayed him in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 miniseries]] adaption, but for the 2003 sequel adaption of ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' and ''[[Children of Dune]]'', ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'', [[Edward Atterton]] was recast as Duncan to play his first [[ghola]] ([[Hayt]]). 
* In the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film adaptation]], Duncan was portrayed by ''Aquaman'' star [[Jason Momoa]].
* Alejandro Jorodowski wanted French actor Alain Delon to portray Duncan in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''. Delon is notably known to have been a screen sex symbol from the 1960s and 1970s.
* Duncan is the only character to make an appearance in all six of [[Frank Herbert]]'s original ''Dune'' novels, albeit in different incarnations. 
* The [[The Dune Encyclopedia|1984's Dune Encyclopedia]] - notably presented as a flawed in-universe document - states that Duncan is a native from Caladan. This is, like a number of other facts from that book, contradicted both by''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', where Duncan's ultimate ghola makes multiple mention of his childhood on Giedi-Prime. It's this later version that is expanded upon in [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s first book in their ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' trilogy: [[House Atreides]].

Castle Caladan
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Castle Caladan (art by Matt Howarth, The Dune Encyclopedia).png|thumb|Castle Caladan as depicted by Matt Howard in the Dune Encyclopedia]]

'''Castle Caladan''' was the official residence of the ruling clan of planet [[Caladan]]. It was an ancient structure, made of very old stone and wood, and was characterised by many rooms and halls, as well as vaulted ceilings with patterned wooden beams. It stood by a great river and farmland owned by [[House Atreides]]. Various rooms within the castle held views of river orchards and [[Mount Syubi]].

Its Dining Hall was the scene of many lush meals presided over by the Atreides [[Duke]].

Castle Caladan was the home of [[House Atreides]] for twenty-six generations, until the Atreides, under the rule of [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto the Just]], the 20th Atreides Duke, were ordered to take over the planetary [[fief]] of [[Arrakis]] in [[10191 AG]].

There are no such descriptions in the original ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' novel. Both adaptations also depict the castle as a mix of the old and the new, with its own distinct and time-worn architecture, and various technology and devices contemporary to the time of the first novel's storyline.

'''Muad'Dib's Jihad'''<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', page 50</ref> ([[10196 AG]] - [[10208 AG]]), also known as '''Paul's Jihad''', was an event that occurred throughout the [[Known Universe]] after the rise of [[Paul Atreides|Paul-Muad'Dib]] and his rise to Emperor of the [[Imperium]].

==History==
After the defeat of [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] and the Imperial Forces on the Plain of [[Arrakeen]], in [[10193 AG]], the [[Fremen]] expanded the battle off-world, beginning after the deposal of Shaddam IV in 10196.

This Jihad spread throughout the entire universe, pillaging millions of planets. A few campaigns include those on [[Naraj]] and its moons. The Fremen [[Fedaykin]] commander [[Farok]] was head of the Naraj Campaign.

The only planet that was spared the raging fire of Muad'Dib's Jihad was the home world of [[House Atreides]], [[Caladan]]. [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], mother of [[Paul Atreides|Paul Muad'Dib]], refused the Fremen any access to the planet, including religious pilgrimage.

The Jihad ended in [[10208 AG]]. According to Muad'Dib, conservative estimates put the Jihad's casualties at 61 billion lives, the sterilization of ninety planets, and the "demoralization" of five hundred additional worlds. Furthermore, 40 different [[religion]]s were wiped out, along with their followers.

Siona Atreides

'''Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides''' was a distant descendent of [[Ghanima Atreides]] and the great [[Farad'n Corrino]], and the first carrier of [[prescience]]-cloaking genes.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Siona was born the daughter of [[Moneo Atreides]], [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II's]] trusted attendant and advisor during his last years. Like her father, Siona harbored a strong rebellious streak, and by her teenage years became violently opposed to Leto's domineering rule of his Empire.

=== Actions against the God Emperor ===
Siona's rough charisma and intelligence helped her emerge as the leader of a group of like-minded dissidents determined to end the God-Emperor's rule through any means necessary. During one incident, Siona barely escaped alive after stealing some of Leto's personal journals and plans, losing ten of her companions to Leto's [[D-wolves]]. Her rebellious actions continued even after Leto forced her to join his [[Fish Speakers]]. Leto's ambition of breeding Siona with his [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] of that time also riled the young Atreides descendant. As a result of Leto's tacit breeding expectation, Siona and the Duncan Idaho ghola did not get along initially.

However, Leto persisted in trying to connect with Siona, in no small part because of her formidable potential, which he later tested in what remained of the [[deep desert]] of [[Arrakis]]. Initially unfamiliar with the [[Fremen]] economy of water, Siona neglected to seal the mouth-flap of her [[stillsuit]] for the first few days, hastening her depletion of water reserves. Leto offered Siona a hammock-like fold of his rings to rest in, which Siona accepted. When she was near death from thirst, Leto offered her liquefied [[Spice Melange]] secreted from tendrils flanking his face. She accepted the blue essence and fell into a spice trance, during which she experienced [[prescience|prescient visions]] showing the need for Leto's [[Golden Path]]. But her experience did not bring her closer to Leto, and her determination to destroy him continued.

=== Assassination of Leto ===
Siona's intentions finally found some substance when she met Idaho again, and the two realized their common ground. Knowing Leto's vulnerability to water - thanks to his [[sandworm]]-hybrid nature - the pair hatched a plan to drown the God-Emperor in the [[Idaho River]] as he travelled to marry [[Hwi Noree]]. That plan succeeded in no small part due to the involvement of [[Nayla]], one of Leto's most fanatical Fish Speakers and Siona's close associate. Having been ordered by Leto to follow any command Siona gave, Nayla severely damaged the main bridge over the Idaho river with a [[lasgun]]. Leto fell into the river, where he devolved back into [[sandtrout]]. The dying Leto directed Siona and Idaho to the last reserves of melange. Leto, seeing his death and devolution as a necessary step on the Golden Path, had used Siona, Nayla, and Idaho to fulfill his own fate. His final gift to Siona and Idaho was the stewardship of his Empire. 

=== Later life ===
After Leto's death, his plan for Siona and Idaho was realized, and the pair married and had over a thousand children together, only nine of whom were daughters. Their children, and indeed all their descendants shared Siona's invisibility to the prescient vision of the [[Spacing Guild]], another necessary element on the Golden Path. The presence and propagation of humans who were undetectable by prescience, their very fates and futures inscrutable by the prescient, would be necessary to free Mankind from the possibility of control by those with such powers, and by bringing this path to fruition, Leto had accomplished just that.

Breeding program
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-08-11-36-53-1.png|thumb]]


The '''Breeding Program''' was a long-term project developed by the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood whereby certain genetic stock was purposefully bred. For more than 10,000 Standard Years the Bene Gesserit had manipulated bloodlines to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], essentially a male Bene Gesserit who could possess Other Memories as well as see into the future.

After it had been established in [[10,191]] [[A.G.]] that [[Paul Atreides]] was the Kwisatz Haderach, the Bene Gesserit breeding program continued. However, it was shortly thereafter usurped by Paul's son [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]], and maintained by him until his death approximately 3,500 years after he took to the Imperial throne. Leto's breeding program was primarily concerned with the creation of an individual like [[Siona Atreides]]; one with the genetic ability to remain unseen by prescient searchers such as the [[Spacing Guild]] or Bene Gesserit. What other secondary goals Leto may have had (or even achieved) remain unknown.

Upon his death, the Bene Gesserit once again took control of the program. Through it they bred genetic lines into their own Sisterhood, and other areas. Their later efforts resulted in [[Miles Teg]], among others.

Atreus
{{Original}}

[[File:KingAtreus.jpg|thumb|King Atreus]]

'''Atreus''' was an ancient [[Greek]] King of [[Mycenae]] who fathered two sons, [[King Agamemnon]] and King Menelaus. These two sons became kings in their own right, and were regarded as the "Atreides", meaning "sons of Atreus".

The [[Atreides]] name managed to be passed on throughout the ages, and along with it, its inherent nobility. This was evidenced by the fact that a noble [[House]] of the [[Imperium]] bore the Atreides name. Rulers of [[House Atreides]] were supposedly direct descendants of [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]], the sons of Atreus.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In the prequel books by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J Anderson]], a curious story is related whereby the Atreides name is handed down by [[Agamemnon]] the Cymek. This Agamemnon could trace his lineage from the 'First Agamemnon', the son of Atreus, as alluded to by [[Leto Atreides II]] in [[God Emperor of Dune (novel)]].

Golden Lion Throne
{{Original}}

The '''Golden Lion Throne''' was the name given to the seat of power for [[House Corrino]], since the symbol of that great House was the golden lion. 

During the days of the Old Imperium, the name was also synonymous with the Imperial throne, since House Corrino had been the rulers of the Old Imperium for thousands of years. Many [[House|Great Houses]] aspired to place one of their own on the Golden Lion Throne.

The Golden Lion Throne itself was said to have been carved out of a single piece of [[Hagal]] quartz.

The term held some meaning during the rule of [[Paul Atreides]]. But by the later years of the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]], and the subsequent disruption of the [[Famine Times]], the Golden Lion Throne ceased to be either a tangible entity or meaningful concept.

Star Jewel Project
{{Original}}

The '''Star Jewel Project''' was an investment project that was undertaken immediately prior to the death of [[Leto Atreides II]].

The investment in Star Jewels was funded by at least five [[House|Great Houses]] through [[CHOAM]], and the [[Bene Gesserit]] acted as bargainers and advisors for the project, for a fee.

The Star Jewel investment project was profitable for all concerned. The Bene Gesserit used their profits to offset losses in an investment on [[Giedi Prime]] during this time, while five of the Great Houses involved used their profits from the venture to maintain [[House|House Minor]] status after experiencing severe economic hardship. Indeed, investment in the Star Jewel project appeared to save those Houses from total collapse, a fate more than 31 Great Houses experienced during the latter half of Leto II's reign.

Victor Atreides
{{Expanded}}

'''Victor Atreides''' ([[10168 AG]] - [[10174 AG]]) was the first son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], and the half-brother of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] and [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]], although they were both born after his death. His mother was [[Kailea Vernius]], sister to [[Rhombur Vernius]] of [[Ix/XD|Ix]], and he was conceived and born on [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] after the loss of status of [[House Vernius]].

== Biography ==
===Leto and Kailea===
Leto had desired Kailea all during his teen years, especially after the exile of Rhombur and his sister to Caladan, after the [[Tlulaxa|Tleilaxu]] takeover of [[Ix/XD|Ix]]. For years, Kailea lived with Leto in [[Castle Caladan]], and was a constant friend and companion to the growing ducal heir. When Leto's father, Duke [[Paulus Atreides]] was gored on the horns of a [[Salusan bull]], Leto was forced to exile his mother, [[Helena Atreides]], to the [[Eastern Continent]] of Caladan, for her secret role in her husband's assassination. During all of these turmoils, including Leto's ordeal at his [[Trial by Forfeiture]], Kailea was there to comfort and help him. Soon afterwards, Kailea and Leto became intimate, Victor was conceived, and born in [[Cala City]].

===Childhood===
Victor's childhood was a happy one, even though relations between Leto and Kailea grew strained over time, especially after Kailea obtained a Lady-In-Waiting from the [[Imperial Court]] on [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], [[Chiara]], who was actually a spy planted by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]]. Over a long period of time, the servant ever so slightly planted false info and manipulated Kailea to turn against Duke Leto, and Victor witnessed many arguments between his mother and father.

===Death on Caladan===
Soon, [[Kailea Vernius|Kailea]] and Chiara plotted to assassinate Leto, and have Victor assume the ducal rights of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. Kailea began to set the plot in motion and seduced Atreides House Guard Captain [[Swain Goire]]. After a tryst with the Guard Captain, Kailea stole his keycard to the Atreides armory, and gave it to Chiara. Chiara ransacked explosives from the Armory, and placed them on the [[skyclipper]] air vessel that Leto planned to navigate to visit various points of interest on the [[Western Continent]]. On the day of the procession; Victor begged Leto to accompany his father on the week-long journey, which Rhombur later joined, as well. As the three of them lofted gracefully over the settlements north of Cala City, Victor discovered the explosives, and accidentally triggered them. Victor was killed instantly, and Leto and Rhombur were severely wounded.

Kailea learned of her son's death, and deeply stabbed Chiara with Goire's ceremonial blade, and then threw herself from a tower window in Castle Caladan. Goire went to [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]] and threw himself upon the mercy of the Duke. Leto sentenced Goire to ''live'' and never forget the pain he caused, and that he would never regain his Duke's trust; and exiled him to live with his mother on the [[Eastern Continent]]. Goire's reply was "someday they will call you 'Leto the Just.'

===Aftermath===
Shortly thereafter, Prince Rhombur received cyborg implants from Dr. [[Wellington Yueh]], and lived on. Leto was awash in grief for his son, but refused to accept a [[ghola]] of Victor from the [[Tleilaxu]], as he considered their takeover of Ix unjust. Leto did, however, recover enough to lead House Atreides again.

It was the deep grief that Jessica saw over Victor's death that caused her to conceive a "replacement" son for Leto. Even though she knew this would set herself against the wishes of the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]], and their complex Breeding Program, the joy she knew Duke Leto would feel, convinced her to conceive [[Paul Atreides]] after this incident.

Old Duke
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:17da6ec62df06b87614b435dc130d1019693ea5571b48ab037f54e666bb71810.png|thumb|Portrait of Paulus Atreides by Albe]]
'''The Old Duke Atreides''' (d. [[10154 AG]] head of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]], was the nineteenth Atreides Duke of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], father to [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], grandfather to [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] (Duke of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] and [[Emperor]] of the [[Known Universe]]), and great-grandfather to [[Leto Atreides II]] (the [[God-Emperor]]).

The Old Duke ruled Caladan as a [[siridar]] [[fief]] bequeathed by the [[House Corrino|Corrino]] [[Padishah Emperor]], most likely [[Elrood Corrino IX/XD|Elrood IX]]. He was a bullfighter until losing his life to a bull.

==Legacy==
The bull was subsequently killed, and its head was mounted on the wall in the Dining Hall of [[Castle Caladan]], (and later the [[Keep]] at [[Arrakeen]]), replete with the Old Duke's blood stains.

Although Paul Atreides was considered - and indeed considered himself - to be much like his father, it was said that Paul in actual fact more resembled the Old Duke in the manner in which he conducted himself. [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], and Duke Leto I, had all observed how Paul's leadership style, certain movements he made, or phrases uttered by him were reminiscent of the Old Duke.

Thufir Hawat, the [[Mentat]] [[Master of Assassins]], was brought into the employ of House Atreides by The Old Duke, where he remained a loyal servant for three successive generations. This could be seen as testament to The Old Duke's ability to inspire loyalty in his men, a classic Atreides trait.

Another testament to the Old Duke's compassion was his act of&nbsp;taking the young Duncan Idaho into his home; an act which the latter did not soon forget. After becoming a [[Sword Master]] of the Ginaz, Idaho would proudly wield the Old Duke's [[sword]].

==Behind the Scenes==
There are scant references to the nineteenth Atreides Duke in Frank Herbert's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. These references involve mainly how he died, the bull's head, and essences of the man seen by others in Paul. In this book, he is only referred to as "The Old Duke". The name of '''Paulus Atreides''' and a history of the man were detailed in the [[Prelude to Dune]] prequel books.

''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'' outlines that The Old Duke was named [[Minotauros Atreides]] and outlines a detailed account of his life, including his upbringing, schooling, how he ascended to the Duchy, and how he came to sire Leto.

Wellington Yueh/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Wellington Yueh}}
{{cleanup}}
[[Image:Dean5.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Dr. Wellington Yueh, as portrayed by actor Dean Stockwell in the 1984 ''Dune'' movie.]].  

'''Wellington Yueh''' ([[10082 AG]]-[[10191 AG]]) was a [[Suk Doctor]] for [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]].
==History==
===Early life===
According to the ''[[Dictionary of Muad'Dib]]'' by the [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Princess Irulan]], Yueh was a Doctor of the [[Suk School]] of Medicine. He was married to a [[Bene Gesserit]] adept named [[Wanna Marcus]]. Yueh graduated from the Suk School in [[10112 AG]], at the age of 30. Little is known of his life between this point and [[10185 AG]] when he entered into the service of House Atreides, at the age of 103. He was described as a tall, thin man with long, grey hair tied in a braid with a [[suk ring]] that hung around his shoulder, a droopy moustache, and of course the diamond tattoo emblazoned on his forehead.

As a graduate of the Suk School, Yueh was imparted with [[Imperial Conditioning]] which prevented him from taking human life. However, for Yueh's devotion to his work and his life, he would go down in history as the first instance that Imperial Conditioning could be broken, and the betrayer of [[Leto I Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides]].

==In the Service of House Atreides==
When Yueh entered into Atreides service, [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] was nine years old. Paul was quite fond of Yueh and Yueh felt an avuncular affection for the young Atreides, even to the point of giving Paul a special gift, an [[Orange Catholic Bible/DE|Orange Catholic Bible]] once the possession of Yueh's beloved wife Wanna.

Indeed, it was for Wanna that Yueh would eventually betray his friends. Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]] [[Mentat/DE|Mentat]], [[Piter de Vries/DE|Piter de Vries]], developed a method to drive Yueh mad and thereby defeat his Imperial Conditioning. Ultimately, Wanna was part of de Vries' scheme to destroy House Atreides. She was abducted by the Harkonnens approximately seven years before Yueh's death. Yueh therefore entered into Atreides service a year after she was abducted. For the Atreides, no other Suk Doctor could be more appropriate; as far as they were concerned, Yueh and his wife were simply more victims of Harkonnen cruelty. Unfortunately for the Atreides, whatever the Harkonnens did to Wanna only served to emotionally enslave the doctor to the Harkonnens.

According to [[Bronso/DE|Bronso]], Yueh went through a prolonged spiritual and emotional depression about the loss of his wife. He submitted to extended psycho-counseling sessions, after which in [[10188 AG]] he personally conducted a memorial service for Wanna and finally grieved her passing.

Four months before the Atreides left for Arrakis, Yueh is known to have been away from the family estate, traveling on a medical inspection to a village. It is speculated by the Alia priesthood that four [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]] and a female (possibly Wanna) traveled to Caladan in a nearby village spending only one evening, and Yueh met that Guild transport and saw Wanna alive under guard. Having seen his beloved, Yueh agreed to betray Duke Leto, hoping thus to free his wife.

It was made known to him by de Vries that if he performed Harkonnen bidding and betrayed Duke Leto, his beloved wife would be freed, or at least, he would know the truth about her fate. Yueh had become a weak-willed, confused, desperate and lonely man who would do anything in his power to learn the truth about Wanna. Thus, receiving inconsistent Harkonnen messages about Wanna, Yueh was driven to madness, and the Imperial Conditioning was broken. Finally his love for Wanna and his love for his Duke moved him in opposite, contradictory directions. He acted as a loving husband who could hope to save only one of the two people he loved most. He hoped to save Wanna. It is possible that he believed that no matter what he did he could not save Duke Leto from his fate. It is also possible that he attempted to redeem himself in some way by helping the Lady Jessica and Paul escape the Harkonnen trap.

===Betrayal===
[[Image:Dune2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Suk Doctor tries to hide his betrayal from [[Thufir Hawat]].]]Yueh laid a trap for Duke Leto in the [[Keep]] at [[Arrakeen]], just before the Harkonnen invasion. Yueh stabbed the Duke with a poison dart, and while he was paralysed he replaced one of the Duke's teeth with a false one that could expel poisonous gas. The idea was that the Duke would have an opportunity to kill the Baron, using the poisoned gas tooth. Unfortunately, the plan failed, and the Duke was killed. Yueh died by the hand of de Vries, stabbed in the back by the twisted Mentat who had come to the logical conclusion that the traitor had outlived his usefulness. He died with the knowledge that his wife had in fact been dead for years, slain by the Harkonnens and kept a secret, so that he could do their bidding.

==Legacy==
Like Jessica, out of a misguided love Yueh set in motion events that ultimately led humanity through the desert of the ancient feudal rivalries, into the long peace and [[Golden Path]] of the Atreides Imperium by having lost the one he loved out of betrayal. Unlike her, he was driven mad by it, and lost his own life in the process. However, both Jessica's and Yueh's lives illustrate the point that there can sometimes be immense consequences, when love gets in the way of duty. Yueh played a crucial role in the annals of history. Were it not for Yueh, it is likely there would have been no [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Paul Muad'Dib]], no fall of the [[House Corrino/DE|Corrino]] dynasty, no rise of the [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]], no liberation of Arrakis, nor even the great [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]] and [[The Scattering]] in which humankind was released from its unitary destiny.

Yueh's actual role in the downfall of Duke Leto Atreides remained difficult for historians to ascertain because of 
conflicting and incomplete reports. They could not determine when that act of betrayal did occur, what was Yueh's role, his thoughts and whether ever was an alleged "final confrontation" between Duke Leto and the Baron Harkonnen. If indeed there was such a confrontation, not one witness lived long enough to record accurately and without bias that turning point of human history.

;Irulan:Even the Atreides family journals were unclear. The earliest relevant published Version was in ''[[The Irulan Report]]'' where Yueh is described as the "betrayer of Duke Leto Atreides" (p.&nbsp;81;  Published under its alternate title, ''[[Analysis: The Arrakeen Crisis]]'' trans. [[Doorsh Suuwaa]], [[Arrakis Studies]] 20 (Grumman: United Worlds)). Irulan was not present at the moment of the alleged betrayal, but she promulgates the official Atreides family position that the Baron could not have possibly prevailed against House Atreides without the assistance of a villainous traitor. Irulan may have been too eager to please the Atreides. She also maintained that his motive was not to seek Wanna's freedom, but finally to put to rest all of his private doubts about her death.

;Muad'dib:Muad'Dib never spoke publicly on the issue but neither did he contradict Irulan's claims and obviously was content with this position. It's not known if he really believed the theory or he needed a 'Judas' to keep his empire and religion firm. The [[Preacher]] of Arrakis, was quoted as saying, "Every religion needs its Judas just as badly as it needs its saints." (Quoted in [[Naib/DE|Naib]] [[Guaddaf]]'s ''[[Judgment on Arrakeen]]'' RCC 29-Z182).

;Alia and the Priesthood:Alia during her youth and in the early days of her Regency, considered that his Imperial Conditioning failed and that he betrayed his Duke. However, toward the end she is said to have confided to her personal guards that she regarded Yueh as a hero who died in defense of his Duke, but this must have to do with her being an [[abomination/DE|abomination]] by the persona of Baron Harkonnen. The priesthood was concerned to preserve its religious authority. The priests of Alia's time regarded Yueh as the Atreides betrayer and were dogmatically committed to the view that Yuen's motive for betraying Duke Leto was to win Wanna's freedom from the Harkonnens.  

;Thufir Hawat:[[Thufir Hawat/DE|Thufir Hawat]] is also thought to have held the same view. Shortly before his death, as he traveled to Dune in the Harkonnen and Corrino entourage, he told [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]] that he had suspected the Lady Jessica to have been the traitor. Hawat apparently thought that Yueh was killed defending the family Atreides. 

;Suk School:The Suk School apologists were eager only to be rid of the scandal of Yueh.

;Bronso:During their systematic inquisitions into the heretical views of their rivals, the [[Komos|Ixians]], they condemned a number of outspoken scholars and historians to death, including [[Bronso/DE|Bronso]] of Ix, accused of many traitorous "crimes", like maintaining that Yueh was merely an innocent victim of a classic feudal economic and political rivalry. Bronso saw Yueh as of no possible value in military terms to either the Harkonnens or the Atreides. He noted that Yueh's chief concerns during his final years were for the medical welfare of the Atreides and their Caladanian subjects. He also was largely occupied by concern for the safety of his wife, Wanna, whom the Harkonnens had taken as a political prisoner (approximately seven years before Yueh's death), knowing that Wanna could not have survived more than a few months of her captivity (See Chapter 2 of his ''[[The Atreides Imperium]]'', Lib. Conf. Temporary Series 70).
:The political significance of these claims would not have been lost on Alia's priesthood. Man's opinion was similar, but clearly more sophisticated, as one might expect from a near-adept of the Bene Gesserit. Although sure of himself, Bronso was, at bottom, merely speculating and as an Ixian may have been generally hostile to the Atreides. 

;Other theories:Yueh appears to have been given High College Imperial Conditioning, although the book ''[[The Great Masquerade: Yueh and the Atreides]]'' by Professor [[Eisor Zhurcia]] claimed that Yueh was a trained assassin and his condition papers were forged. This thesis was widely accepted by several of the Minor Houses during the early years of Paul's reign but later evidence suggests that Yueh exhibited a considerable amount of medical expertise and human sensitivity, characteristics generally not found in saboteurs and assassins. Later opinion held that Yueh indeed did graduate with High College Imperial Conditioning in approximately [[10112 AG]]. Yueh thus came to be regarded as the paradigmatic case of the fatal failure of Suk Conditioning.

==Character==
We can thus likely rule
out Irulan's hypothesis that Yueh was a
malicious traitor as well as the Suk
interpretation that he was an assassin.
We are then left with three other
possibilities

:1. There is clear evidence that the Suk of that era knew the dangers of insanity and privately warned all who purchased Suk doctors that the Imperial Conditioning against disloyalty could not be guaranteed if the doctor went insane. The buyers were advised to be aware of telltale signs of insanity. It has been argued that Yueh was '''insane''', driven to madness by inconsistent Harkonnen messages about Wanna, a theory advanced by criminologist, [[Duncan Idaho-11736]] (the original of the report has disappeared, but Leto's transcription may be found in his Journal, RCC 2-A213), which maintains that the [[Piter de Vries/DE|Piter de Vries]] developed a method to drive Yueh mad and thereby defeat his Imperial Conditioning. As a Mentat, Piter de Vries would have been familiar with methods of disrupting members of his own Order, and may have reasoned that they might work on Yueh. In Yueh's case there had been his depression on Caladan, noted earlier.

However, there were no signs of a relapse and no other signs of insanity in Yueh's behavior. Nonetheless, Idaho maintained that Yueh's encounter with the face dancer Wanna shortly before his leaving the familiar Caladan for the inhospitable Dune was the shock that drove Yueh mad. Yueh's actions after that point moved toward betrayal not out of hate, but out of an insane doubt and manic paranoia. Idaho laments that his former self, the original Idaho, was so occupied with preparations for Dune that he failed to detect Yueh's insanity.

The chief counter-evidence to this interpretation is that Yueh's insanity and his plotting with the Harkonnens escaped the notice of the entire Atreides household including Paul, Hawat the Mentat, and Jessica, the Bene Gesserit adept. That insanity could go unnoticed for so long seems unlikely. On the other hand, that Leto II allowed Idaho to advance the view gives it some credibility in the light of Leto II's renowned quasi-omniscience.

:2. The second hypothesis, '''incompetence''', was proposed later by one of Siona's descendants, [[Ritah al-Jofar Nisri Atreides]] in her ''[[Factors in the Yueh Betrayal]]'' (Studies in Imperial History, OS 146:449-70) who maintained that Yueh was indeed desperate with the false hope that Wanna lived, but that he was perfectly sane, and that no one in the Atreides household suspected Yueh of treachery. Ritah paints a picture of Yueh as a weak-willed, confused, desperate and lonely man who would do anything in his power to learn the truth about Wanna. Ritah's position is harsh; she scoffs at Yueh, saying that one did not have to be a Mentat to know beyond doubt that Wanna would never be freed. Further, Yueh would have to have been a complete fool not to know that by his act of betrayal all manner of evil consequences would befall the Atreides. Yueh, according to Ritah, should be held individually and personally accountable for the fall of Duke Leto, the seizure of Dune by the Harkonnens, the death of many loyal Atreides subjects, and the permanent ruin of the Suk School's reputation.

:3. The third view, that Yueh acted out of '''love''', albeit a desperate and perhaps misguided passion is based on suggestions found in the Journal of [[Nayla]]. (Her Journal in [[RCC 2-A816]] makes any reference to Yueh, but the divided loyalties of the two share many features, and the comparison can be instructive.) One can see in Yueh, as in Nayla, a profound personal tension between conflicting imperatives. To obey his Imperial Conditioning he should be loyal to that person whose medical welfare he was guarding. Yet Yueh's Imperial Conditioning did not specify exactly who that person was. As the years passed in ease on Caladan, Yueh could comfortably serve Duke Leto and his family. But when Wanna was taken from him he became desperate and confused. Finally his love for Wanna and his love for his Duke moved him in opposite, contradictory directions. He acted not as a fool, not as a madman, but as a lover who could hope to save only one of the two people he loved most. He hoped to save Wanna, perhaps believing that no matter what he did he could not save Duke Leto from the superior forces of the Harkonnens. We do know that his love led him to give his life helping Lady Jessica and Paul escape the Harkonnen trap.

Arrakis Revolt
{{Original}}


[[File:Dune-ccg-eye-of-the-storm-surprise-assault-262u_51K8lNAqc2L-1.jpg|thumb]]

The '''Arrakis Revolt''' was the term historically used to describe the uprising of the [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] under the leadership of [[Paul Atreides]], in the latter events of the [[Desert War|Desert War,]] which eventually led to the fall of [[House Corrino]] from power. 

== History ==
After the [[Siege of Arrakeen]], the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] occupiers set about restoring [[Spice Melange|spice]] production on Arrakis. Thinking [[House Atreides]] wiped out and the Fremen too weak to pose any real threat, [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]] squeezed the planet and its inhabitants in a vice-grip. 

What neither the Harkonnens nor the [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Padishah Emperor]] knew was that Paul Atreides and his mother, [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] had survived and joined a local Fremen tribe. Taking the name "Muad'Dib", Paul led his newfound brethren in a guerrilla war against their common enemy. With the new weapons, skills and tactics given to them by the newcomers, the already formidable Fremen warriors were made infinitely more deadly. Within a few years, the Harkonnen forces on the planet had suffered crippling losses and spice output had been reduced to insufficient levels.     

The Harkonnens' inability to safeguard spice production eventually demanded the attention of the other [[House Major|Great Houses,]] [[Spacing Guild|the Guild]], and even the emperor himself. The conflict finally culminated in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], where Muad'Dib and his Fremen blew down the walls of the city with [[atomics]] and rode powerful [[Sandworm|sandworms]] through the fortifications to overwhelm the [[Sardaukar]] and Harkonnen forces. This marked the end of the [[Desert War]], and the advent of the [[Atreides Empire]].

Duncan Idaho/Featured
{{FeatArchive}}

[[Image:8969-5459.gif|right|thumb|200px|Duncan Idaho, as portrayed by actor Richard Jordan in the 1984 ''Dune'' Movie]]
'''Duncan Idaho''' was a swordmaster in the service of [[House Atreides]], and one of [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]]'s right-hand men, with [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Thufir Hawat]].

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Idaho was born on [[Giedi Prime]]. At an early age he and his family felt the wrath of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]]: his family was murdered by them, and Idaho was trained to be hunted for sport. However, Idaho escaped his captors and found his way to [[Caladan]], where he eventually ended up in the service of [[House Atreides]]. He rose up to eventually become the Duke's swordmaster and trusted advisor.

===Atreides Service===
Duncan came under the service of the Atreides after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens. The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgement was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

A graduate of the [[House Ginaz|Ginaz]] school, Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul (and possibly the Duke's armies) in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]]. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was be regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education.

===Move to Arrakis===
When the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief, under the order of the [[Emperor]], Idaho became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.

When the Emperor launched an attack on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho was killed by the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]] by a blow to the head, but not before he despatched no less than seventeen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly. In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]].

==Rebirths==
===First Rebirth===
After Paul's ascension to the throne, Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]], a clone made by the [[Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as 'Hayt' in his ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In ensuing the trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a [[Bene Tleilax]] plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife Chani, but only if he abdicated his throne.

Idaho married [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]]. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. In order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed Javid, Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[naib]] [[Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Ducan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.

===Subsequent Rebirths===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for approximately 3,500 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The ego-memories of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.

The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of godhood and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm). Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes". In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself. After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" (as the Duncans only possessed memories of the original Duncan). If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.

After the death of Leto II, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola survived.

===Final Incarnation===
[[Miles Teg]], the Bene Gesserit [[Bashar]] was commissioned to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho and managed to do so. However, when [[Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play, and all of the memories of the previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released.

Idaho was later used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola, but later escaped with his ward and [[Sheeana]] into unchartered space to escape from the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Honored Matres]].

==Appearance==
Duncan Idaho was said to be very handsome. He had black, curly hair and a dark complexion. During the days of the original Duncan Idaho he was regarded as something of a ladies' man.

== Behind the Scenes ==
Idaho is the only character to appear in all six original [[Frank Herbert]] ''Dune'' novels, albeit in different incarnations. Despite only having a relatively minor appearance in the original ''Dune'', the character was to become a focal point of the over-all saga, and his existence as a series of gholas was to serve an ultimate purpose.

In the 1984 '''Dune''' movie, Duncan Idaho was played by late actor Richard Jordan.

Ego-memory
{{Original}}

[[File:71cbb71db674d8dad17f3573f35255e5399b2f5ca49be88c5d061acd97f15805-1.png|thumb]]

'''Ego-memory''' is the term used to describe the consciousness of an individual present in [[genetic memory]].

== Occurrences ==
With the exception of the [[House Atreides|Atreides]]: [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], the only people who could be exposed to ego-memories were [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother|Reverend Mothers]], and non-Bene Gesserit women who took the [[Water of Life]] and survived.

== Abomination ==
It was theorised that only those with Bene Gesserit training and mental discipline were capable of preventing an ego-memory from taking over their consciousness, thereby effectively possessing them and becoming [[abomination]].

Since Alia Atreides had been [[pre-born]] to consciousness, she did not have the ability to prevent her consciousness from being overcome by the memories of her ancestors. As she grew into an adult, it became increasingly difficult for her to control the "inner multitude", and the voices of those within her would increasingly impede on her consciousness. In order to minimise this, she made an agreement with the ego-memory of the [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], her maternal grandfather, to quell the others, in exchange for sharing her consciousness. True to his devious form, however, the ego-likeness of the Harkonnen took more control of Alia than bargained for, and Alia was possessed by him.

Ultimately, Alia managed to overcome her possession by throwing herself from a high window, killing herself, and the ego-memories of all within her, including the Baron.

== Leto II and the Idaho Gholas ==
When Leto II became Emperor, he had a series of [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola|gholas]] created to serve him across the millennia. Upon their first arrival at his [[Keep]], Leto would use the voices and ego-memories of the long dead [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]] and Paul to ease Idaho's adjustment to the new order.

'''Paul Atreides''' was the last Duke of [[House Atreides]], the leader of the [[Fremen]], and the first [[House Atreides|Atreides]] Emperor. He was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]: the powerful [[Prescience|prescient]] being long sought by the [[Bene Gesserit]]. He was known by many names throughout his life, including [[Muad'Dib]], [[Usul]], and [[The Preacher]].


== Upbringing ==
As the son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his official concubine, Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-covered planet of [[Caladan]], the ancestral home of [[House Atreides]].

Paul was a product of the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Breeding program|breeding program]], which had brought together his parents with the intention of producing a female who could mate with the heir to [[House Harkonnen]], and produce the fabled [[Kwisatz Hadarach]]. However, the plans of the [[Bene Gesserit]] were thrown into turmoil by the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica's]] longing to give her beloved partner a male heir to his House.

Under the supervision of the [[mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat]] and military experts [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]], Paul was raised to be the heir of [[House Atreides]], one of the most powerful, respected, and moral Great Houses in the [[Corrino Empire]]. He showed ample talent, both physically and intellectually, earning him attention, especially by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who hoped to salvage their breeding plans.

== Transformation on Arrakis ==
[[Image:Newman Paulatreides.jpg|thumb|left|[[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]] as '''Paul Atreides''' in the Sci-Fi Channel [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|miniseries]]. ]]
Paul Atreides accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] was relocated to the desert world [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange]]. However, when the deception of [[House Harkonnen]] and the Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] was revealed, he escaped into the desert with his mother and joined the [[Fremen]]. Upon joining the desert people he took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]].

This experience, coupled with significant exposure to the [[Spice Melange]] triggered dormant prescient abilities within Paul's bloodline. These abilities, coupled with his leadership skills, his military training, and an ancient prophecy of the people of [[Arrakis]], enabled Paul to become the leader of the formidable [[Fremen]].
It is on Arrakis that he discovers that his grandfather - the father of Jessica - was the Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]]. He also drank the [[Water of Life]] and survived, expanding his consciousness bringing his prescience near to perfection. He is the first and last male to drink the Water of Life and survive, showing himself to be the Kwisatz Haderach.

During this period Paul met and fell in love with [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], the daughter of planetologist and native [[Fremen]] [[Liet Kynes]]. Their first son, [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]] was murdered by [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]], further fueling the existing enmity between [[House Atreides]] and [[House Harkonnen]].

After spearheading a highly effective campaign of [[wikipedia:guerilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] against the [[House Harkonnen]] and [[Sardaukar]] forces that had taken control of [[Arrakis]], Paul conquered the powers in [[Arrakeen]] and, thanks to the presence of Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], successfully negotiated the end of the long-standing [[Corrino Empire]] and his own ascendancy to Emperor.

== The New Empire, and The Golden Path ==
[[Image:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Paul becomes Emperor]] Upon crowning himself Emperor, Paul enacted [[The Golden Path]], a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire.

A result of this was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. After a bloody [[wikipedia:jihad|Jihad]] that lasted more than twelve years, Emperor Paul Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion through military and diplomatic coercion.

Paul's interpretation of [[The Golden Path]] also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.

==Final Days as Emperor==
Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]].

Additionally, doubts began to surface in his mind regarding his interpretation of the [[The Golden Path]]. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out.

That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, and became even more enticing following [[Chani Kynes|Chani]]'s death during childbirth. After being blinded during the atomic detonation of a [[stone burner]] in [[Arrakeen]] he disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]] in the traditional [[Fremen]] manner.

==The Preacher==
Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert.

By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.

The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront ALia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Duncan Idaho. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.

Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion.

While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transormation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.

==Behind the Scenes==
In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, McLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.

In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]].

'''Lady''' '''Helena Atreides''' ([[10095 AG]] - [[10187 AG]]) born as '''Helena''' '''Richese''', was the wife of [[Duke]] [[Paulus Atreides]] and the arranger of his assassination.

==Biography==

=== Early life {{C|10095-10153}} ===
Helena was the daughter of [[Count]] [[Ilban Richese]] and his wife [[Edwina Corrino]]. Her marriage to Paulus was political in nature, and the couple had little in common and limited love for one another. Partly as a result of this and partly because of Helena's continued allegiance to [[House Richese]], they gradually drifted apart until they were on acrimonious terms. She did, however, maintain a perfect front during important meetings and public events and fussed about her own appearance. During her spare time, she preferred to study the [[Orange Catholic Bible]] and other religious texts.

Paulus educated Leto with methods which Helena disagreed; he make him worked with villagers (had spent a month working in the [[pundi rice]] fields) and socialized with citizens and commoners.

She was not warm to Leto, and often said she would never have any more children. She bore a son only out of duty to [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]], rather than out of a natural maternal instinct. When Leto was about to leave for [[Ix/XD|Ix]], she insisted to Paulus to send him somewhere else.

===Exiles from Ix {{C|10153-10156}}===
Paulus and Helena's relationship reached a new low while their only son was living on Ix. When Leto returned to Caladan, with the exiled children of [[House Vernius]], [[Rhombur Vernius]] and [[Kailea Vernius]], Helena was strongly against their taking refuge in [[Castle Caladan]] with House Atreides. She believed that House Vernius had been exiled from Ix because of their affront to God, and that they were being punished by coming close to building [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machines]].

===Assassinating Paulus {{C|10156}}===
After a year, Helena began to secretly plot against Paulus, as she strongly believed that he was doing irrovcable harm to his ducal position. Helena secretly arranged for the [[salusan bull]] Paulus was to fight to be drugged, and the bull ended up killing Duke Paulus.

Leto later discovered his mother was involved in the drug of the animal, so he exiled her to Caladan's [[Eastern Continent]], to live in solitude in the [[Abbey]] of the [[Sisters in Isolation]] .

===Pleading to Help House Richese {{C|10175}}===
A few years later, when the [[Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] attacked [[Korona]], an artificial moon of [[Richese]], during the [[Great Spice War]]; the resulting damage to the planet below was catastrophic. Helena found out about the plight of her maiden people and trekked across Caladan, to ask Leto to help the plight of her former planet. Out of compassion for his mother's House and planet of her youth, Leto agreed to send relief aid.

===Meeting Paul and Death {{C|10187}}===
Over ten years later, during the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]], [[Duncan Idaho]] and Paul Atreides, whom Idaho had sworn to protect, fled their attempted murderers by taking flight to the sparsely populated Eastern Continent on Caladan. After a trek through the dense jungle, Idaho decided to take refuge with the Sisters in their [[Abbey]]. Paul met his grandmother, Lady Helena—who had risen to [[Abbess]] of the organization—for the first time; although Helena was not especially warm to her grandchild.

Helena castigated Idaho for bringing young Atreides to the Sisters, speaking of their desire to remain in peace and obscurity. Although the [[Grumman]] mercenaries had been unable to find the two for almost a week, once they realized where the duo were, they mercilessly attacked the abbey. Instead of deciding to flee or put up resistance, Helena chose to continue to her meditative weaving, as the giant building came crashing down around her, and she was killed by falling rubble.

Leto Atreides I/Featured

Duke '''Leto Atreides I''' (born 10,140, died 10,191) was the ruler of [[House Atreides]], the father of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]], and the grandfather of [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]]. He was also known as ''Leto the Just'', due to his even-handed and compassionate leadership style.

== Early Years ==
Born on [[Caladan]] to Duke [[Paulus Atreides]] and Lady [[Helena Atreides]] (nee [[House Richese|Richese]]), Leto claimed [[House Atreides|Atreides]], [[House Richese|Richese]] and [[House Corrino|Corrino]] heritage: the former through his father, and the latter two through his mother. After a formal education on [[Ix]], Leto returned to Caladan. He became Duke when his father was killed by a drugged [[Salusan bull]] during a bull-fighting event. Leto later discovered his mother's involvement in the incident and exiled her as punishment. {{ref|Behind_the_Scenes}}

== Life as Duke ==
After a failed relationship with the concubine [[Kailea Vernius]], who bore Leto a son named [[Victor Atreides|Victor]] {{ref|Behind_the_Scenes}}, Leto entered into a lasting relationship with a [[Bene Gesserit]] acolyte named [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] who, after entering into the Atreides household, was bestowed the title of [[Lady]]. Jessica's instructions from the Bene Gesserit were to bear a daughter, so that when she reached maturity she would mate with the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] heir. The purpose of this was twofold, one reason obvious, the other, known only to the Bene Gesserit: to end the feud between the two Great Houses, and to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. Unfortunately for the Bene Gesserit, Jessica fell in love with Leto, and succumbed to his wishes to sire a son, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. Unfortunately for Leto, however, the same characteristics for which Jessica fell in love, would ultimately prove to be a liability.

Despite falling in love with Jessica himself, and despite the fact that she did indeed bear him his beloved son, Leto never married Jessica. However, his refusal to marry Jessica was not out of snobbery; Leto's refusal to marry was driven by his astute political insticts. Leto had developed a reputation among the other Great Houses and had become very popular in the [[Landsraad]]. While he remained single he ensured that House Atreides was open to political alliance with those other Houses. Given the intense hatred that existed between House Atreides and the House Harkonnen, to remain open and seem agreeable to alliance was considered a significant tactical advantage, as it enabled Leto to hedge his bets. This political acumen, while it won him many fans in the Imperium, also inspired the jealousy of the Emperor. He was deemed a threat by [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], who decided to use the long established animosity between House Harkonnen and House Atreides to dispose of this troublesome Duke, and of House Atreides altogether.

== Migration to Arrakis ==
[[Image:Leto-Atreides-1-Hurt.jpg|thumb|right|Leto Atreides I portrayed by actor William Hurt.]]
"''Here I am, here I remain!''"

After almost two decades of rule on [[Caladan]] with the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], Leto was ordered by the Emperor to take over the planetary fief of [[Arrakis]] from House Harkonnen, and thus was required to move his House from Caladan to 'Dune'. Arrakis was a notoriously difficult planet to manage, but as the only source of the [[spice melange]], it was also unimaginably important. Thus the role brought both jeopardy and the jealousy of Leto's fellow noblemen among the Great Houses. Thus, Leto leapt at the chance to increase his standing in the Landsraad, even though he knew it would also put his House in great peril. Leto committed all his resources to the venture, and it was said that to illustrate this point to his people and the people of Arrakis, that upon his arrival he planted a flag upon the battlements at Arrakeen and proclaimed: "''Here I am, here I remain!''"

Leto's resolve was strengthened by a letter the Emperor had sent him upon his Arrival on Arrakis. Addressed to his "Noble Duke", the letter outlined that Leto was given House Corrino's full support to introduce and uphold the rule of the [[Faufreluches]]. This letter served to illustrate Corrino duplicity, for at the same time, Shaddam IV was plotting Leto's demise.

During consolidation of his rule over Arrakis, Leto made a quick and positive impact on the people of Dune. His fairhandedness, political savvy, and personal charisma saw many in Arrakeen society, from the [[Fremen]] to the arisocratic Houses Minor, become supporters. However, only a short while into Leto's rule on Dune, the Emperor gave Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] approval to invade and destroy House Atreides, even going so far as to provide some of his own [[Sardaukar]] in support. The Emperor's urgency in disposing of House Atreides was amplified by the fact that he had come to know that the Duke Leto had managed to develop a small force of soliders capable of rivalling the Emperor's Sardaukar. This had been accomplished through Leto's principal advisors and generals, namely [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho]], and [[Gurney Halleck]].

==Death==
During the invasion Leto was betrayed by his private [[Suk]] Doctor, [[Wellington Yueh]], and turned over to the Harkonnens. Though Yueh had given Leto the chance to kill the Baron Harkonnen using a poisoned tooth embedded in the Duke's mouth, the scheme failed. Consequently Leto died during the assassination attempt, but the Baron Harkonnen survived.

Some years later, Leto's remains were recovered by his son Paul in [[Arrakeen]]. Paul laid his father's remains to rest in the [[Skull Tomb]] in the desert of Arrakis. The late Duke's legacy was felt in [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] reign as Emperor, and also in the conception of a daughter [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], carried by [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] but only discovered after Leto's death.

==Legacy==
In some ways, Leto lived on in his son Paul and grandson Leto II, through their possession of [[Other Memory]]. It was also partially Leto's love for Duncan Idaho that saw Leto II maintain a series of Idaho gholas throughout his reign. During both Paul's and Leto II's reign, millions flocked to visit Leto I's shrine, since Atreides ancestry had taken on a religious mystique. More than this however, Leto came to symbolise all that was good about the Atreides bloodline, namely courage, integrity, loyalty, justice, and honour. Because of this some have postulated that had Leto survived his rule of Arrakis, he would have eventually commanded the same fanaticism of the Fremen with which they came to follow his son Paul. Indeed, some have taken this argument further and postulated that his popularity with those he ruled, combined with his popularity in the Landsraad, may have seen him eventually ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Thus, the positive strength of character and many talents Leto was generally regarded to possess, and the possibilities of what might have been, illustrates the inherent tragedy of his story.

== Behind the Scenes ==
The upbringing of Leto Atreides is only glazed over in [[Frank Herbert]]'s original Dune novels. Some details, such as the nature of his father's death, are alluded to, but many others are elaborated on solely in the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. The plotline of [[House Vernius]] and [[Victor Atreides]] was meant to add depth to Leto I, one of the most beloved and tragic characters in the ''Dune'' Universe. However, the plot point of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson that Leto maintained concubines while in love with Jessica, is inconsistent with the honourable characteristics bestowed upon him by Frank Herbert. The history of the character provided by [[The Dune Encyclopedia]], while considered non-canon, is more consistent with this portrayal, and does not contradict any of Frank Herbert's work.

Leto Atreides was portrayed by German actor Jurgen Prochnow in the 1984 film adaptation of Dune. In the 2000 Dune Miniseries, He was portrayed by actor William Hurt.

For over 10,000 years, [[House Corrino]] was the ruling House of the Universe, giving it the title, "The Imperial House Corrino". For 81 generations, the Golden Lion Throne was passed down through the family until [[House Atreides]] took the Throne and defeated the Corrinos at the [[Battle of Arrakeen]].

Its value was measured by the fact that it provided not only an independent source of historical information, but also revealed the mind of the people, sharing with its audience their understanding of their culture, and displaying their hopes and fears. These last insights were exemplified in ''"How [[Muad'Dib]] Got His Name"'', a [[Fremen]] folktale that weaved together wholly imaginary incidents from the wool of fact: [[Paul Atreides]]' adaptation to the desert and [[Fremen]] ways.

'''Estes Atreides''' [b. [[173 BG]]] one of the twin sons of [[Vorian Atreides]] and [[Leronica Tergiet]].  Estes was taller and more flamboyant compared to his brother [[Kagin Atreides|Kagin]].

He and his brother were grown by their foster father, [[Kalem Vazz]] on [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], until he was killed by [[elecran]]s when they were young.

Vorian tried to return to Leronica and meet the boys better but did not want to spoil their memories by revealing he was their true father, a fact the teen boys discovered it by accident; they were shocked since they preferred the memories with Vazz. 

Vorian attempted to have good connections with his sons and took care for their proper schooling but they were still distant to him, although Leronica insisted to take his name. The distance was bigger towards Estes with whom he had gotten into a quarrel over a minor sarcastic comment.

'''Kagin Atreides''' [b. [[173 BG]]] one of the twin sons of [[Vorian Atreides]] and [[Leronica Tergiet]].  Kagin was quieter and shorter, introspective follower compared to his brother [[Estes Atreides|Estes]].

He and his brother were grown by their foster father, [[Kalem Vazz]] on [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], until he was killed by [[elecran]]s when they were young.

Vorian tried to return to Leronica and meet the boys better but did not want to spoil their memories by revealing he was their true father, until Kagin discovered it himself by accident. The teen boys were shocked since they preferred the memories with Vazz. Vorian attempted his sons to have good connections, proper schooling but they were still distant to him, although Leronica insisted to take his name.

'''Leto Atreides II''' ([[10210 AG]] - [[Timeline (Original Dune)|13728 AG]]) was the third and last ruler of the [[Atreides Empire]] as [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] and the first and only [[God Emperor]] from [[10219 AG]] until his assassination in [[13728 AG]], when his intergalactic empire began to break up into a loose federation ruled by various powerful groups.  

Leto was born on Arrakis to then-Padishah Emperor [[Paul Atreides]] and his [[Fremen]] [[concubine]] [[Chani Kynes]], the daughter of the great [[Liet Kynes]], just after his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides]]. He and his sister were preborn due to Chani's consumption of the spice melange in large amounts before her death. He was named after the [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]], his paternal grandfather, and [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], his older brother, who was murdered in infancy.

Seeing that their aunt, the [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], had been possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of her grandfather [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Leto II and Ghanima planned to prevent her from destroying the Atreides and preventing the [[Golden Path]], the salvation of humanity which Leto worked to bring about for most of his life. This period also saw them evade an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]] which resulted in the banishment of [[Wensicia Corrino]] by her son [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]], who became Ghanima's lover. Following Alia's suicide as well as the murder of his father Paul, Leto took the title of God Emperor and ruled over humanity with an iron fist for 3,500 years, guiding it away from extinction. 

==Biography==
===Upbringing {{C|10210-10219}}===
Leto II and his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] were born on planet [[Arrakis]] at the end of the reign of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]]. Their mother [[Chani]] died shortly after giving birth to the two children, mainly due to complications arising from large amounts of contraceptives that were surreptitiously given to her by Paul's legal wife [[Irulan Corrino]]. Paul had anticipated the birth of a daughter, Ghanima, due to his prescient visions. However, Leto's arrival came as a surprise to the [[Emperor]]. Both children were [[pre-born]].

Following Chani's death, and the apparent death of their father in the desert of Arrakis, Leto and his sister became the legal responsibility of Paul's younger sister, the regent Alia. Though they were granted a fine upbringing, little attention was bestowed upon them by their aunt, who was possessed by [[Abomination]] and enthralled by her own power and the mysticism developed around the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] name by Paul.

====Evolution on Arrakis ====
[[Image:GodEmperorofDune-LetoWorm.jpg|thumb|left|Leto II as a worm]]
When they were nine years old, Leto and Ghanima gained the attention of their paternal grandmother, [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], who returned to Arrakis from [[Caladan]] to inspect them as part of her obligations to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her [[Fremen]] allies to help protect them.

At this same time, Leto's prescient powers began to emerge. Through visions and intuition, he discovered the [[Golden Path]] that his father had earlier uncovered and begun to follow. However, unlike Paul, Leto developed a greater understanding of the Golden Path's implications. He sensed not only its dangers but also the painful steps that had to be taken to avoid it unraveling, which would be to the peril of humankind.

Leto and Ghanima escaped an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]]. The two split up, with Ghanima conditioned to believe her brother was dead so that if she were to be interrogated on his whereabouts, she would not be able to tell the truth. Leto slipped into almost total anonymity, using the time and relative seclusion to build a foundation of power and knowledge through which the full impact of the Golden Path could be realized. To enact such steps required a strong (almost brutal) grip on power and longevity that would override the shortsightedness and impatience of Man.

Thus, after spending time amongst a variety of fringe [[Fremen]] elements, including [[The Preacher]], Leto accepted [[sand trout]] upon his body and began the conversion into a human-sandworm hybrid. This transformation (which, in the beginning, was essentially a form of [[wikipedia:Exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]), boosted Leto's strength, reflexes, and speed immensely, and he was able to move across large distances on foot.

====Ascendancy to Emperor====
After his transformation had progressed to a sufficient stage, Leto emerged from the desert and returned to the city of [[Arrakeen]] to confront the possessed Alia and claim the throne of the empire.  After Alia managed to briefly overcome her possession and take her own life, Leto claimed the title of Padishah "God" Emperor and promptly married his sister to consolidate his hegemony. The marriage was purely legal. Ghanima accepted [[Farad'n Corrino]] as her mate, but their descendants would be known as Atreides. The same year, Leto began writing his diaries, which would later be known as the [[Stolen Journals]]. 

===Early years as God Emperor {{C|10219-12335}}===
Shortly after his ascendancy, Leto ordered a new ghola of [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]] from the Bene Tleilax to serve him as Commander of the Royal Guard, as the original [[Hayt]] ghola had been killed by the Fremen [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] during the last days of Alia's regency. During the earliest years of his reign, Leto used the existing Fremen forces as well as Farad'n's [[Sardaukar]] troops, which he had given to him upon his ascension to the throne, to enforce his rule. His armies of Fremen and Sardaukar were commanded by a series of Idaho gholas, which would usually be replaced after they tried to kill him and he killed them in response, although very occasionally he allowed them to have natural deaths.

Over the centuries, Leto's empire, which he ruled as the God Emperor, became multigalactic through gradual growth. Very early on in this expansion, Leto suppressed the ancient Order of Mentats and banned the training of Mentats because they formed a nucleus of independent opposition.

====Death of Ghanima====
While Leto lived on for millenia, his sister and wife Ghanima, being but a mortal human woman, died after a relatively normal life in the first years of Leto's rule. After told of her death, Leto, heartbroken, wrote this in his journals:

{{Quote|The sand beach as grey as a dead cheek, a green tideflow reflects cloud ripples; I stand on the dark wet edge. Cold foam cleanses my toes. I smell driftwood smoke.|Leto's journals|God Emperor of Dune}}
He pressed a strand of Ghanima's hair, with a starflower blossom which she once brought to him, between these pages of the journals.

====The [[Fish Speaker|Fish Speakers]]====
While for centuries the Fremen and Sardaukar legions were enough for Leto, he ultimately decided that these forces were unsuitable to his needs. Leto believed that male dominated military forces were essentially predatory and would turn against the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy, whereas a female one would tame and calm. He also needed a reliable religious organization to enforce what was coming to be known as [[Leto's Peace]] to ensure the unfolding of the Golden Path. Because of this, he founded a new all-female army to serve him, commanded by the continuing series of Duncan Idahos.

Leto named the army the "Fish Speakers" because the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams.  Although the Fish Speakers were all female, males were still employed as house guards, and their commander Idaho was male. With the exception of the nomadic Amazons who legend described as once ruling part of the Asian steppes of [[Earth|Old Earth]], the Fish Speakers were just about the only effective all-female army known throughout the history of the universe. They were also, in terms of worlds ruled and historical longevity, the most effective military force ever known.

====Burning of the Nine Historians====
In his 2,116th year as the God Emperor, the famed Nine Historians came to Leto's attention. The historians angered Leto, for they had lied in their works, and he thought they deserved to be punished. On his orders, they were rendered unconscious, then burned on pyres of their own published works. Not one of them felt the flames, and they died peacefully. When Leto was petitioned by other historians seeking word of their fellows, he said:

{{Quote|They were destroyed because they lied pretentiously. Have no fear that my wrath will fall upon you because of your innocent mistakes. I am not overly fond of creating martyrs. Martyrs tend to set dramatic events adrift in human affairs. Drama is one of the targets of my predation. Tremble only if you build false accounts and stand pride-fully upon them. Go now and do not speak of this.|Leto II to the historians|God Emperor of Dune}}
Rumors of this spread across the Empire in the years that followed, through accounts which were later judged by the Bene Gesserit to have originated with Leto himself through his majordomo [[Ikonicre]].<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', page 70</ref>

===Last days {{C|13650-13728}}===
====Suppression of Wallach IX====
In the 3,431st year of Leto's reign, he learned through prescience of the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on Wallach IX. He sent Duncan Idaho to extinguish the School in order to enforce his ban of the Order, but some of the Mentat-Sisters escaped, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood.

====Visit of Sisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko====
Bene Gesserit Sisters Quintinius Violet Chenoeh and Tawsuoko came to Arrakis in the 3,507th year of Leto's reign to confirm the long-suspected execution of the Nine Historians. Sister Chenoeh was invited to accompany the Fish Speakers in an entourage which accompanied one of Leto's infrequent peregrinations. At one point, she was invited to trot behind the Royal Cart and converse with the God Emperor himself. He told Chenoeh to tell the Sisterhood that he would "resore the outward view" and that the Bene Gesserit of all people should know the dangers of breeding for a particular characteristic, of seeking a defined genetic goal. Leto also told her things which she did not include in her report to the Sisterhood - thoughts on how he would be remembered, but also the statement that he would never see her again because she would not live to become a Reverend Mother. His predictions came true, as Chenoeh died in the Spice Agony due to melange incombatiblity.

====Events leading up to the assassination====
=====Final failed assassination attempt by Duncan Idaho=====
A year after Chenoeh's death, the latest Duncan Idaho ghola made the last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life by a Duncan after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him. After tracing the lasgun back to the Ixian Ambassador, Iyo Kobat, Leto ordered Kobat to leave Arrakis, deciding not to kill him because he was too unimportant. Instead, he told him to carry a message to Ix that the God Emperor knew about the agreement between Ix and the Spacing Guild. Leto also gave Kobat a private message for his masters that he wanted an extension for his cart, and that they were to send him a large supply of ridulian crystal paper.

Soon after, Leto sensed the need for the next step on the Golden Path and knew that his rule must end for further progress to occur. Thus Leto used [[Siona Atreides]], a distant descendant of Ghanima and Farad'n, and yet another replacement Duncan Idaho ghola created by the scheming Tleilaxu after the failed assassination. With them, he sowed the seed of the Atreides genes for future generations. 

=====Assassination attempt by the Bene Tleilax=====
During this period, the Bene Tleilax attempted to kill Leto during his progression in the Royal Cart across the Idaho River with his majordomo Moneo Atreides, the newest Duncan Idaho ghola and an entourage of Fish Speakers. Face Dancers approached the group disguised as Museum Fremen (the remnants of the old Fremen of the desert days) before all transforming into a copy of Duncan, each having also obtained uniforms identical to those worn by Idaho. Their hope was to confuse the Fish Speakers into not knowing which Duncan to obey and to kill the God Emperor in the confusion. This failed, however, when Duncan took off his uniform, and so the Fish Speakers knew to obey the commands of the naked Duncan as they fought the Face Dancers. After this incident, he had the Tleilaxu Ambassador publically flogged and expelled.

=====Assassination attempt by the Bene Gesserit=====
Also in the months leading up to the God Emperor's death, two Reverend Mothers and Truthsayers, Tertius Eileen Anteac (who was also one of the Mentats trained on Wallach IX) and Marcus Claire Luyseyal, came to Arrakis. They were warned about the upcoming assassination attempt by the Tleilaxu by Othwi Yake, the assistant to former Ixian ambassador Iyo Kobat, the man who had supplied the weapon Leto's most recent Duncan Idaho had used to try and kill the God Emperor, but their message to him arrived only after the assassination had already failed, because the captain of the Fish Speaker guard would not believe them. Anteac and Luyseyal were granted an audience with Leto, however, at the end of which he agreed to continue the spice allotment of the Sisterhood at its current level for the next decade despite a further attempt at assassination using spice essence by the Sisters.

=====Hwi Noree and death of Malky=====
Leto fell in love with the new Ixian Ambassador [[Hwi Noree]]. Hwi was a direct female clone of Leto's former friend and advisor [[Malky]] created by the Tleilaxu in an Ixian [[no-chamber]]. Since Hwi was conceived and raised outside of his [[prescience|prescient]] abilities, Leto was unaware of her until she was presented to him as an ambassador. Leto was instantly smitten with Noree, and within a few months proposed marriage to her, and set the date of betrothal. After the announcement that Leto and Hwi were to wed, Hwi's uncle Malky was recalled to Arrakis by Leto, and murdered by Moneo after a last personal discussion with his old friend.

====The assassination====
A few weeks later, Leto, Hwi, and Moneo lost their lives when Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by her assistant, [[Nayla]]. They all fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]]. 

{{Quote|Do not fear the Ixians. They can make the machines, but they no longer can make arafel. I know. I was there.|Leto's last words|God Emperor of Dune}}
In dying, he released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise. 

===Legacy===
{{Quote|I will die four deaths - the death of the flesh, the death of the soul, the death of the myth, and the death of reason. And all of these deaths contain the seeds of resurrection.|Leto cryptically explains his death and legacy|God Emperor of Dune}}
During and after his reign, Leto II was viewed as an extremely controversial figure. Following Leto's death, a chain of dramatic events took place over a span of 1,500 years. This included the [[Famine Times]], [[the Scattering]], and the recreation of the [[sandworm]]s on [[Arrakis]], which emerged from the [[sandtrout]] that escaped from Leto's body when he fell into the water. Many of the established power brokers who existed at the start of his rule were either destroyed or significantly weakened, due to his draconian tactics and a monopoly on the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. To his admirers, Leto II was known as the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], but to his enemies (including the [[Bene Gesserit]]) he was labeled [[the Tyrant]] of the [[known universe]]. He was worshipped by the Bene Tleilax as the Prophet of God after his death. 

The religion of the God Emperor also continued on Dune, which became known as Rakis. He was worshipped by the priests of the new Church of the Divided God, which became the dominant force on Rakis and had essential control of the planet, as the great Divided God and the third member of the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven, the other being his grandmother Jessica, and his father, Muad'Dib. It was also believed by the Priests of Rakis that he had carried within him the spirit of his brother, Leto II the Elder. This worship continued until the [[Battle of Rakis|attack on the planet]] by the [[Honored Matres]] and also with those returned to the Old Empire from the Scattering, who called Leto II Dur or [[Guldur]].

====Living on in the sandworms====
It was also said that within each sandworm that grew on Arrakis after his death, a pearl of his consciousness existed. This theory was supported when,  1,500 years after his death, an Arrakeen girl named [[Sheeana]], who was a direct descendant of Siona and Duncan Idaho who later became the youngest ever Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, displayed the power to control the worms.

==Name==
===Etymology===
'''Leto Atreides II''' was named after his paternal grandfather, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]], and his deceased brother [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]]. Due to his brother [[Stiros]] of the [[Church of the Divided God]] called him '''Leto III''' rather than '''Leto II''', but was argued with by [[Hedley Tuek]], who told him that the spirit of the older Leto had been reborn in the younger.

Those who worshipped him on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] called him the '''Great God Dur''', meaning "Great God of Darkness", or '''Guldur''', signifying black magic. 

===Titles===
During his reign and later Leto was commonly known by his title of '''God Emperor''', but after his death he was more commonly called the '''Tyrant''', predominantely by the [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]], who also referred to him as the '''Worm''', '''Worm God''', or '''Old Worm'''. The Bene Tleilax, on the other hand, privately called him the '''Prophet''' or '''Prophet of God''' due to their belief that he was a prophet of their god. 

==Trivia==
*It is possible that the design of the God-Emperor of Mankind, a major character from the ''Warhammer 40,000'' tabletop game franchise, was influenced by Leto Atreides II. The two share strong psychic abilities, are practically immortal, bear the title of "God Emperor", rule over a political body known as "The Imperium", guide mankind towards survival, rule with an iron fist, and are the center of a vast imperial cult. In addition, large sections of the background material of ''Warhammer 40,000 ''in general are seemingly influenced by the ''Dune ''novels.
*In the books, Paul anticipated the birth of Ghanima, but not Leto's. In the 2003 Children of Dune miniseries, this was reversed; he saw visions of a teenaged Leto but not Ghanima.

'''Demetrios Atreides''' [d. [[58 BG]]] was a junior officer serving under [[Sheuset Ecevit]] against the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]], enlisted as a [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]] Auxiliary in the [[Sixth Draco Wing]], representing [[Mockmuhl Cluster]] which could have been his homeweorld.

During the [[Battle of Corrin/DE|Battle of Corrin]], Demetrios was the gunnery officer on ''[[Lu-ta]]'' and after all the senior officers were killed early in the 3-day battle<ref>According to the CORRIN, BATTLE OF entry, the battle lasted only 2 hours</ref>, he assumed command of the vessel.

After [[Abulurd Harkonnen/DE|Abulurd Harkonnen]] deserted the battle, [[Sulaiman al-Hajj Kunaitra]] threatened to turn [[Sheuset Costin]]'s left flank. Atreides rallied Costin's forces and led an attack that took Kunaitra by surprise. His ship was damaged and himself killed.

Historians claim that this action was the key turning point of the struggle and Atreides was ennobled as Baron Tantalos by Emperor Sheuset I. He was given large estates on [[Enskog]] in [[86 BG]].

He had three sons: [[Pausanias Atreides]], [[Theseus Atreides]] and [[Konstantinos Atreides]]. On his death, Pausanias succeeded to the Barony

[[File:Iasonatreides.png|thumb|Iason Atreides Fanart]]

[[Count]] '''Iason Atreides''' (d. [[681 AG]]<ref>Possibly</ref>) was a son of Count [[Pausanias III Atreides]].

He was instrumental in settling the differences between the various branches of the [[House Corrino/DE|Imperial House]], the [[House of Alman]], [[House of al-Qair]] and [[House of Rautha]]: In [[603 AG]] he persuaded [[Harmon II]] al-Qair to step down in favor of [[Audrii I]], the proper heir of [[Shaddam I]], who restored the House of Alman to the throne.
==Contributions==
Iason managed to concentrate most of the imperial power in his hands and reorganized the government reestablishing the principles of the [[Great Convention/DE|Great Convention]]; now instead of a chaotic personal rule now it became a trierarchy: The Imperial seat, the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]] and [[CHOAM/DE|CHOAM]] and the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]]. He arranged regular meetings for the Landsraad.

The Imperial power was diluted and the Emperor became responsible for his actions to the [[Imperial Family]], themselves controlled and balanced by the [[Imperial Household]], its offshoots the [[Imperial Cousines]] and the [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]] [[Over-Bashar]]s.

For his contributions, in [[635 AG]] Iason was named [[Count]] [[Aramanli]] by the Emperor, and married Princess [[Salusa]] his daughter, thus becoming a member of the [[Imperial Household]]. His sons were Count [[Heraklios II Atreides]] and [[Demetrios VIII Atreides]].<Ref>Atreides, House, Prominent members</ref> He was succeded by Heraklios, who took on the family estates and titles.

'''Minotauros Atreides''' (10059 AG - [[10163 AG]]) was '''''Duke Mintor'', ''Count [[Thuestes]]''''' and '''Lord of [[Tantalos]]''' , born in planet [[Caladan/DE|Caladan]]. Son of Duke [[Minos ΙΧ Atreides]] and his concubine, [[Lady]] [[Katlin Kalun]]. Brother of [[Io Atreides]] and demi-brother of [[Paulos XVIII Atreides]] and other 5 siblings. With his concubine [[Bekah]], he was father of [[Leto Atreides I/DE|Leto Atreides I]].

Since [[10116 AG]], he was the 266th [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]], and ruler of [[Caladan/DE|Caladan]].
==Life==
Born in the Old Palace on Caladan, he was raised by his mother in her household on [[Nagge]]. He grew up with his full sister Io, but rarely saw his father and other siblings.

He showed great interest in simple things like flowers and gardening and enjoyed to talk about them with the gardener of the manor, [[Gerasimos Herakleidos]], but soon was entranced by horses and bulls, watching [[Serapheim Hippodes]] handling them with just a piece of colored cloth; initially protective Searpheim relented and introduced young Mintor to the bullring.<ref name=mintor>Atreides, Minotauros</ref>

===Studies and marriage===
When his father died in [[10077 AG]], his brother Paulos succeeded him; Mintor himself was named Count [[Chalcedony]] and Heir Presumptive. He asked his brother's permission to receive military training in order to represent the Duchy as an ambassador.

He spent the next 10 years studying weapons, defense, politics and bull-fighting. He met 25 years old [[Lovisa Rogier]], and was charmed by her wit. They married on Caladan, however she died childless. Mintor never married again and took [[Bekah]] as his [[Concubine]].

He was awarded the [[Emperor's Cross]] in [[10109 AG]].<ref name=mintor/>

===Rule===
In [[10116 AG]] his brother Duke Paulos died having fathered only unacknowledged bastards with no legal rights to the throne; Mintor succeeded him.

As a Duke, Mintor was named to the special panel convened by [[Elrood IX/DE|Elrood IX]] in [[10134 AG]] to decide the succession of [[House Khumali]].<ref name=mintor/>

Eventually he had his only son, [[Leto I Atreides|Leto]] with Bekah who died in delivery.<ref name=leto>Atreides, Duke Leto</ref>

The [[Mentat/DE|Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat/DE|Thufir Hawat]], was brought into the employ of House Atreides by The Old Duke, where he remained a loyal servant for three successive generations. This could be seen as testament to The Old Duke's ability to inspire loyalty in his men, a classic Atreides trait.

When Leto was 16, he sent him as the [[Designated Observer]] for House Atreides to the revolt at [[Mask Prime]].<ref name=leto/>

He also built a Corrida near his old home on Nagge. He died in the bullring at the age of 104 by [[El Muerte]].<ref name=mintor/> His son avenged his death and never entered the Corrida again.<ref name=leto/>

==Character==
Mintor was tall, not considered handsome, and had a queer sense of humor. He used to crack his lips at a side-splitter. During his studying years he was famous especially among women and a wanted guest in parties.<ref name=mintor/>

== Behind the Scenes ==
There are scant references to the nineteenth Atreides Duke in Frank Herbert's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. These references involve mainly how he died, the bull's head, and essences of the man seen by others in Paul. In this book, he is only referred to as "The Old Duke". The name of '''[[Paulus Atreides]]''' and a history of the man were detailed in the [[Prelude to Dune]] prequel books.

Achilleus sold the family estates on [[Chalcedony]] and used the money to invest in [[CHOAM/DE|CHOAM]] shares of undeveloped words. There, he developed the raw resources, and sold the processed goods back to the Houses.

He became the richest man in the Imperium and used his power to reduce the power of restored Emperor [[Corrin IV]] ([[1701 AG]]).

He left the throne and retired in cryogenic suspension along his son in [[4670 AG]], with a pretext (released after his disappearance) that he retired to a monastery. His absence was followed by the [[Second Republic]].

His fate remained a mystery until his return in [[4813 AG]], while keeping imprisoned his son, [[Mikael III Atreides]] for most of his life. However when he was restored, he deposed his father in [[4888 AG]] and put him in a prison.

Mikael II escaped in the spring of [[4913 AG]], rounded a handful of guards and had his sons including [[Mikael VI]] killed.

He himself was murdered by a daughter while taking a bath, with a large piece of pure sodium into the water.

His remains were left outside the doorway to his palace to rot in the sun. After him, the [[Age of Pretenders]] came followed by the [[Third Republic]]; the [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]] stayed out of Imperial politics for millennia.

Leto Atreides II/DE
[[Image:Leto atreides ii.jpg|thumb|Leto Atreides II from the Sci-Fi miniseries ''Children of Dune'', portrayed by James McAvoy.]]





{{DE-Or,Ex|Leto Atreides II}}

'''Leto Atreides II''', ([[10209 AG]] - [[13724 AG]]), also known as the '''[[God-Emperor|God Emperor]],''' was the third and last ruler of the [[Atreides Empire]]. He was the second to hold the title of [[Padishah Emperor/DE|Padishah Emperor,]] and the first and only to hold the title of God Emperor. He was born the second son of Emperor [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] and his [[Fremen]] [[concubine]] [[Chani Kynes/DE|Chani Kynes]], the daughter of the great [[Liet Kynes]], just after his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima Atreides]]. After the death of his aunt, the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]], Leto II proclaimed himself Emperor and ruled for 3,508 standard years, guiding humankind with his iron fist towards survival. He was named after the [[Duke]] [[Leto I Atreides|Leto I Atreides,]] his paternal grandfather.

==History==

===Upbringing===
Leto II and his twin sister Ghanima were born on [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]] during the reign of Emperor Paul Atreides. Their mother Chani died shortly after giving birth to the two children, due in large part to complications arising from large amounts of contraceptives that were surreptitiously given to her by Paul's legal wife [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]]. Paul had anticipated Ghanima due to his prescient visions. However, Leto's arrival came as a surprise to the [[Emperor]].

Following Chani's death, and the apparent death of their father in the desert of Arrakis, Leto and his sister became the legal responsibility of Paul's younger sister, the regent Alia. Though they were granted a fine upbringing, little attention was bestowed upon them by their aunt, who was possessed by [[Abomination/DE|Abomination]] and enthralled by her own power and the mysticism developed around the [[House Atreides/DE|Atreides]] name by Paul.

===Evolution on Arrakis===
[[Image:GodEmperorofDune-LetoWorm.jpg|thumb|left|Leto II as a worm]]
When they were nine years old, Leto and Ghanima gained the attention of their maternal grandmother, the [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Lady Jessica]], who returned to Arrakis from planet [[Caladan/DE|Caladan]] to inspect them as part of her obligations to the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]]. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] allies to help protect them.

At this same time, Leto's prescient powers began to emerge. Through visions and intuition he discovered the [[Golden Path]] that his father had earlier uncovered and begun to follow. However, unlike Paul, Leto developed a greater understanding of the Golden Path's implications. He sensed not only its dangers but also the painful steps that had to be taken to avoid it unraveling, which would be to the peril of humankind.

After Leto and Ghanima escaped a failed assassination attempt by [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]], the two split up, with Ghanima conditioned to believe her brother was dead, so that if she were to be interrogated on his whereabouts, she would not be able to tell the truth.

Leto then slipped into almost total anonymity, using the time and relative seclusion to build a foundation of power and knowledge through which the full impact of the [[Golden Path]] could be realized. To enact such steps required a strong (almost brutal) grip on power, and a longevity that would override the shortsightedness and impatience of Man.

Thus, after spending time amongst a variety of fringe Fremen elements, including [[The Preacher]], Leto accepted [[Sandtrout/DE|sandtrout]] upon his body and began the conversion into a human-sandworm hybrid. This transformation (which, at the beginning, was essentially a form of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton exoskeleton]), boosted Leto's strength, reflexes and speed immensely, and he was able to move across large distances on foot.

===Ascendancy to Emperor===
After his transformation had progressed to a sufficient stage, Leto emerged from the desert and returned to the city of [[Arrakeen]] to confront the possessed Alia and claim the throne of the empire. After Alia managed to briefly overcome her possession and take her own life, Leto claimed the title of Emperor and promptly married his sister, to consolidate his hegemony. The marriage was purely legal, however, and Ghanima accepted [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Farad'n Corrino]], who had been taught Bene Gesserit ways by the Lady Jessica, as her exclusive concubine.

===Reign of Leto II===
[[Image:Leto (Stribling).jpg|thumb|Concept Art by Michael Stribling]] Through the evolution of Leto's body and powers (both prescience and access to possibly every dead ancestor in history), he was rendered infertile and slowly evolved into what appeared to be a [[sandworm/DE|sandworm]] with a human face and appendages of limited strength and range. In return, his lifespan, speed and reflexes were significantly increased, and during a reign of some 3,500 years Leto II successfully guided humanity through a period of vulnerability and potential danger.

During his rule, Leto II outlawed the order of [[Mentat/DE|Mentats]] and began shutting down any renegade schools wherever found. The art of being a Mentat had not yet been eliminated, however, surviving through underground schools. Moreover, Leto took control of the Bene Gesserit [[breeding program]], outlawed interstellar travel without his permission, and forced populations to be planet-bound through garrisons of [[Fish Speakers/DE|Fish Speakers]] on all planets of the [[Imperium]].

[[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Iaho-11099]], the consummate Atreidean supporter, rebelled against Leto's increasing authoritarianism and questioned his abuse of that same loyalty. He initiated the last, sad [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]] campaign, a move that resulted in Idaho's death, the final destruction of the Imperial Legions, and the founding of the [[Fish Speakers/DE|Fish Speakers]].

The very notion of any Duncan Idaho leading the hated Sardaukar in an ill-fated yet grandiose, campaign battle against an Atreides is the stuff of which a latterday [[Harq al-Harba]] could have made great tragedy.

===Last Days===
Toward the end of his reign Leto sensed the need for the next step on the [[Golden Path]], and knew that his rule must end for further progress to occur. Thus using [[Siona Atreides|Siona]] - a distant descendant of Ghanima and her concubine Farad'n - and a [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] created by the scheming [[Bene Tleilax/DE|Tleilaxu]], he sowed the seed of the Atreides genes for future generations. Additionally, he began the reversal of the terraforming on Arrakis, and witnessed the planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realised Fremen dream of a lush paradise.

Ultimately Leto lost his own life when Siona ordered the bridge he was crossing to be cut by a lasgun and he fell into the Idaho River. Following Leto's death, a chain of dramatic events took place over a span of 1500 years, that included the [[Famine Times]], [[the Scattering]], and the recreation of the sandworms on Arrakis, which emerged from the [[sandtrout/DE|sandtrout]] that escaped from Leto's body when he fell into the water.
===Legacy During the Scattering and Later===
During and after his reign, Leto II was viewed as an extremely controversial figure. Many of the established power brokers who existed at the start of his rule were either destroyed or significantly weakened, due to his draconian tactics and a monopoly on the [[Spice/DE|spice melange]]. To his admirers, Leto II was known as the God Emperor.

The [[Church of the Divided God]] claimed that the stunted sandworms that still could be found in one small spare desert on [[Rakis]] were embodiments of Him — they used the capital letter — and that He would return as the fully grown, terrifying, majestic [[Shai-Hulud/DE|Shai-Hulud]], Old Father Eternity, to restore Arrakis, His home world, and the Fremen, His faithful disciples, to greatness.

[[File:51nCU6VwP4L._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Dune CCG weaponsmaster Illustration]]

'''Swain Goire''' was a trusted [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] Captain of the [[Armory]] based in [[Cala City]]. He eventually failed [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], which resulted in the death of the Duke's son, [[Victor Atreides]]. 

==History==
===Death of Victor Atreides===
Swain Goire rose through the ranks of the household of House Atreides, and eventually became in charge of all of the weapons of [[Castle Caladan/XD|Castle Caladan]]. As the marriage of Duke Leto and [[Kailea Vernius]] began to spiral into anger and depression for both parties; Kailea decided to seduce Goire. Under the misguided influence of secret [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] spy, [[Chiara]], Kailea decided to assassinate Leto, so that six-year old Victor cold assume ducal rights, with her as [[Regent]].

Kailea stole the key to the Armory out of Swain's belt lock, and gave it to Chiara. Goire knew inadvertently thought that he had simply misplaced the key, and did not mention the supposed misplacement for days. In the meantime, Leto had scheduled a seasonal tour of the [[Western Continent]] of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], in which he was going alone to visit various villages and hamlets in his blimp-like [[skyclipper]].

On the night before Leto's departure, Chiara stole into the Armory, and placed a large cache of explosives on the skyclipper. The next day, as Leto boarded the clipper, unbeknowdst to Kailea; her brother, [[Rhombur Vernius]], and little Victor, both decided to go on the journey with the Duke. Soon after rising into the air, Victor happened upon the explosives, and set them off; which killed him instantly, permanently maimed Rhombur, and injured Leto.

As the plot became known, Goire confronted Kailea; and her silence and half denials was enogh evidence that Swain needed to know of her implicitly. Kailea killed Chiara, and then committed suicide; and Swain Goire faced the Duke alone. Since Goire had not intentionally tried to kill Victor, Leto sentenced Swain "to live" with the grief and misery he had caused to the Atreides family. He was sentenced to exile to live with Leto's mother, the murderess of [[Paulus Atreides]], the [[Lady]] [[Helena Atreides]].

===Saving the Life of Paul Atreides===
Swain lived as a bodyguard to the Lady in the [[Abbey]] of the [[Sisters in Isolation]] on the [[Eastern Continent]] of Caladan for years with no events in his life. As the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]] erupted on Caladan, [[Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] and twelve-year old [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] fled to the sparsely populated continent to seek shelter from secret [[Grumman]]-Harkonnen assassins. After Paul and Duncan arrived, they were greeted tersely by the Lady, who had become risen to become [[Abbess]] of the religious organization.

As the assassins filed projectile missiles into the Abbey, Swain Goiore decided to atone for his involvement in Victor's death. He single-handedly fought against the Grumman-Harkonnen assassins, while Duncan and Paul had time to flee into the dense Caldanian jungles. Soon after the duo escaped into the foliage, Goire was killed by the assassins.

At the ceremony, the Jongleurs, who had been paid to murder the woman, aligned the theater's famous glass mirrors and amplifiers to create an intense light beam that almost assassinated her.

[[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], who had previously joined the Jongleur group, noticed that the refractory beams, would in fact, impact at the seat of the Governor's chair. He left the protection of his mother, [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], and his father [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], and pushed her out of the way, saving her life. The beam left a giant deadly burst on the back of her chair.

A few seconds later, a sound blast wave, impacted the area, as well; but [[Rhombur Vernius]], who was their with his son, [[Bronso Vernius]], pushed the entire entourage' out of harm's way, giving up his own life. As Bronso rushed over to his father, Rhombur was concerned about young Paul, and said, "Is Paul safe?". These lasts words embittered Bronso and he cast [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] out of the lives of [[House Vernius]] for the next 12 years.

He was trained as a matador and received combat training in operations on [[Wallor Tertius]]. He served on the Atreides flagship ''[[Van Atreides]]'' as a subaltern.

He was granted authority at 16, when Duke Mintor sent him as the [[Designated Observer]] for House Atreides to the [[revolt at Mask Prime|revolt]] at [[Mask Prime]]. During a planetary assault, Leto felt the strategy was weak, and unilaterally withheld the Atreides contingent. Indeed 3 brigades and at least 2 cruisers of Houses [[House Harkonnen/DE|Harkonnen]] and [[House Kaastaar|Kaastaar]] were destroyed. 

His patient and lifesaving tactics of siege, psywar and sabotage had worked brilliantly; the na-Duke was in the [[Palace of Mask]], in complete control of the rebellious planet, when a new contingent of Imperial levies was sent to their aid. A subsequent [[Imperial Inquest]] concurred that the original attack plan was badly flawed. Thanks to Leto's judgment, the Atreides forces were among the only survivors of the carnage.

This first sign of his legendary judgment and strong leadership won him the immediate loyalty of the Atreides forces from then on.

Leto was only partway through his military training, under the general tutelage of the famed household [[mentat/DE|mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat/DE|Thufir Hawat]], when Duke Mintor was killed in the Corrida in [[10163 AG]].<ref name=leto>Atreides, Duke Leto I</ref>

===Dukedom===
{{quote|If they were all simply as correct and as sure of their place as the Duke, the Empire would be a paradise|[[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]] after an audience with Leto}}
The new Duke demanded the right to avenge his father's death on the horns of [[El Muerte]], a symbolic and politically astute act to prove his bravery and win the support and trust of the Caladan people. Leto entered the corrida for a last time, only to kill El Muerte with his father's estoque.

Soon after ascending the Ducal throne, Leto had to encounter a [[mutiny on Pinskau|mutiny]] within his own troops on the planet [[Pinskau]], who held prisoners their own officers. Leto took the time and care to uncover the true reason for his and to ensure that their totally justifiable grievances were dealt with. This was a chance to cement the loyalty of his troops forever, by sheer force of personality and evidence of his unbreakable integrity. <ref name=leto/>

[[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]], a devotee of the Corrida, had taken a mild interest in Leto ever since his ascension to the Ducal throne. After the mutiny, Leto was summoned to a private audience with the emperor. It is reported that the emperor wished to discuss nothing but the battle with El Muerte, but they held the meeting so long that his schedules were being thrown off and upon the repeated urgings of his social secretary the audience had to end.

From [[10158 AG]] until [[10174 AG]], Duke Leto continued to make a name for himself as one of the most honorable of the nobility. When [[House Harkonnen/DE|House Harkonnen]] managed a raid on [[House Tipnear]], a close ally of House Atreides, Leto summoned household troops of [[House Chusak]] (another victim of Harkonnen raids) and Tipnear and proceeded in retaliation with a "black" raid on [[Giedi Prime/DE|Giedi Prime]] in [[10165 AG]]. A combined force of Atreides Guards and allies landed on Giedi Prime and took over the slave-market city of [[Baathaas]]: approximately 20000 slaves were freed, and immense damage was done to the Harkonnen slaving fleet based there. The slaves were taken to Caladan where they were
given their freedom and were offered passage to any of the systems that had taken part in the raid. This was the action that brought [[Gurney Halleck/DE|Gurney Halleck]], into the service of House Atreides.

The retaliation was "black" since it was without flags or insignia, no declaration of war, no admission of participation afterwards, and it was a typical example of the adventures
he embarked upon during that period.

The Duke managed another victory in the [[Battle of Thar system]] ([[10167 AG]]), for which he was
granted the title [[Chevalier of the Imperium]] by Emperor [[Shaddam IV Corrino]], not only a symbol of his undeniable bravery, but also of
Shaddam's growing respect for him.

===Marriage and family===
{{quote|I have all that an honest man could want — the love of a woman, the loyalty of my subjects, the respect of my peers, and a son|Leto I}}
[[File:Leto dune.gif|thumb|Leto in ''[[Dune (video game)]]'']]
The Duke refused to marry for political reasons. While he had no concumbine in
the Castle, he had the habit of selling his concubines their own contracts
after a short time, usually for a penny. When his buyers brought him a lady who
eventually bored him, he dismissed his buyers with distressing regularity.

In [[10175 AG/DE|10175 AG]], one of the Duke's buyers, with some trepidation,
and after careful investigation by the mentat Thufir Hawat, brought the Duke
[[Jessica Atreides/DE]] as a [[Bound Concubine]] for his
household, a present from the headmistress of the [[Bene
Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] school on Caladan. 
 
After a few hours the Duke arrived for his meal with the new concubine on his
arm (a privilege never granted any other concubine) and during the dinner, he
included Jessica in the table conversation.

The next day, Leto summoned the buyer to him and announced that he was
dismissed. The buyer was stunned, and began stammering apologies to the Duke,
but the Duke explained to him that he no longer required his services, and
offered him the position of a quartermaster-general and take charge of all
trade to and from Caladan.

It was announced five months later that the Lady Jessica was to bear the Duke's first child. A boy was born four months later, and was named [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul]]. This new family led the Duke to adopt a more domestic lifestyle. He no longer paced the castle like a caged
animal when there was peace (though he still went on campaign with his troops whenever the Levy was summoned, and fought bravely in their front). He threw himself fully into the education of his son, so that he would grow up worthy of the Atreides crest.

With the able assistance of Warmaster Halleck and [[Swordmaster]] (later Warmaster) [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]], Leto began training Paul in command as soon as Paul could speak.

The emperor's affection resulted to jealous nobles attempting to undermine
Leto's position at the court. In the [[Battle of Grumman]] ([[10176 AG]]),
Atreides forces again saved the day, making Shaddam IV (always suspicious, like
all emperors) and his counselors realize that too much success on the
battlefield is much worse than too little: Leto with his incredibly loyal
troops, would become too powerful, too popular, and (in spite of his obvious
loyalty) a threat to the throne .

Thus it was that by the enemies of the Atreides hatched a plan, which require the transplantation of House Atreides
from Caladan to Arrakis, in the guise of a reward.

==Death==
During the invasion Leto was betrayed by his private [[Suk/DE|Suk]] Doctor, [[Wellington Yueh/DE|Wellington Yueh]], and turned over to the Harkonnens. Though Yueh had given Leto the chance to kill the Baron Harkonnen using a poisoned tooth embedded in the Duke's mouth, the scheme failed. Consequently Leto died during the assassination attempt, but the Baron Harkonnen survived - although his twisted mentat Piter de Vries was killed by the poison.

Some years later, Leto's remains were recovered by his son Paul in [[Arrakeen/DE|Arrakeen]]. Paul laid his father's remains to rest in the [[Skull Tomb]] in the desert of Arrakis.<ref>Atreides, Paul</ref> The late Duke's legacy was felt in [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul's]] reign as Emperor, and also in the conception of a daughter [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia]], carried by Jessica but only discovered after Leto's death.

==Character==
Throughout his lifetime, Leto showed faith in and care for his troops and
commanders. His fairness and wisdom gained him a House force famous as the most
loyal, trustworthy and honorable in the Imperium.

Nevertheless, the Duke continued being Leto the Just, administering Caladan as
best he knew. He had the habit of taking promising young orphans into the
Household, where they were raised as members of his own family. At times, there
were up to a dozen children in [[Castle Caladan/DE|Castle Caladan]], who would
stay until they were apprenticed off to a good master.  The Duke had the habit
of selling his concubines their own contracts after a short time, usually for a
penny and a habit of dismissing his buyers with distressing regularity when
they brought him a lady who eventually bored him.

His reputation made those less worthy continually sniped at Leto, thinking his
example to be a subtle insult against themselves. Leto's refusal to marry for political reasons did not help against this attitude.

The emperor's acknowledgement of Leto as an exemplar of correct Noble behavior
very likely led, paradoxically, to his demise, death and the near-destruction
of his house; the emperor's obvious affection for Leto caused intense jealousy
among those not so favored. The Court was almost universally illdisposed toward
this upstart Duke from some unknown backwater planet whose only export was the
insignificant and distasteful "[[pundi rice]]".<ref name=leto/>
===Archetypal analysis===
The Duke lived at the time when masculinity was losing its exclusive hold on people's psyches and feminine consciousness was just beginning to come into its own. Most people of his time retained the traditional belief that intelligence, power, order, even civilization itself, were essentially masculine property. The Duke perfectly incarnated the best, vitally Archetypal manliness, but it proved insufficient, as he died defeated.<ref>Atreides-Harkonnen, Lady Jessica</ref>

Castle Caladan/DE
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Castle Caladan (art by Matt Howarth, The Dune Encyclopedia).png|thumb|Castle Caladan as depicted by Matt Howard in the Dune Encyclopedia]]


'''Castle Caladan''' was the official residence of the ruling clan of planet Caladan, the [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]] for 6 generations before, and 26 more throughout their tenure as Dukes of [[Caladan/DE|Caladan]]; until the Atreides, under the rule of Duke Leto the Just, the 20th Atreides Duke, were ordered to take over the planetary fief of Arrakis in [[10191 AG]]. 

It was an impressive ancient structure, made of very old stone and wood, and was characterized by many rooms and halls, as well as vaulted ceilings with patterned wooden beams. Its Dining Hall was the scene of many lush meals presided over by the Atreides Duke.

==History==
[[Wesle Atreides]], younger brother of ruling Duke [[Philippos Atreides]] of [[Gallatin]] in [[8711 AG]], no longer wishing to live in the shadow of his sibling, decided to move to Caladan and ordered the Castle to be built. 

[[Istaivan Hiivaladan]], one of the most illustrious architects of the era, was commissioned to design the Castle; it has been described as his finest work. 

Wesle was a lifelong student of history and wished to pattern Castle Caladan after the manor of a feudal lord of Old [[Terra]].

When the Castle was completed in [[8722 AG]], the Siridar-Duke, now [[Paulos XVI Atreides]], moved his household to occupy the new residence. From [[8721 AG]] to [[9350 AG]], the Atreides lived quietly in the Castle with emphasis on serenity and comfort, its priceless
art collection, and its persistent lack of any military touch - aside from that token garrison -reflected this serenity.
===Reformation===
In [[9355 AG]], following the assumption of the Dukedom of [[Philippos XIV Atreides]] and the massacre of [[Hestia]], all this changed: walls were removed and rearranged to provide room for the extra servitors needed by a ruling House; the military barracks increased tenfold; and the already sturdy defenses were strengthened to full capacity, at which any but an all-out planetary attack could be rebuffed. 

The quarters which Philippos and his heirs occupied slowly evolved from their luxurious state to more utilitarian — occasionally Spartan — forms. Drawing rooms and studies
became military headquarters and training rooms for the younger family members, who were now born into the family of a politically ambitious Duke and destined to face all of the dangers
such a birthright made unavoidable. 

The studios and galleries so central to the lives of the earlier inhabitants became divertissements for the Atreides ladies rather than places in which the lords of the manor would spend their days. Within a century even the great, library had fallen into
disfavor, its volumes conscientiously dusted but seldom studied: As the nerve center of their fief, Castle Caladan served the Atreides for another 22 generations. 
===Migration to Arrakis===
It was left in the hands of numerous caretakers following the assignment of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]] as fief entire to Duke [[Leto I Atreides]]. (Although Count [[Hasimir Fenring/DE|Hasimir Fenring]] was appointed Siridar-in-Absentia of Calada, he did not relocate to Caladan and there is no evidence the Count or his Lady ever so much as visited the Castle).

Upon her return to Caladan in [[10196 AG]], the Lady Jessica took up residence in Castle Caladan again and remained there — with one interruption, from [[10218 AG]] to [[10220 AG]] —
until her death in [[10256 AG]]. Following the Lady's burial in the Atreides Family
cemetery on Caladan, the Castle was declared an Imperial monument.

Many generations of Imperial citizens toured the building and grounds which made up the birthplace of Paul Muad'Dib Atreides, treating them as things to be venerated for
themselves. In time, the fact that Castle Caladan had once been a stately and gracious dwelling was almost completely forgotten, dwarfed by comparison to its importance in the
Atreides legend.

Certainly it was Hiivaladan's longest-lasting, as portions of the central keep and much of the perimeter wall remained standing even after the [[God Emperor]]'s rule.

==Geography==
It stood by a great river and farmland owned by House Atreides. Various rooms within the castle held views of river orchards and [[Mount Syubi]]. The estate surrounding the Castle included approximately 500 hectares of arable land enclosed by a wall 2 meters thick and 50 meters in height built of varicolored Caladanian granite and strengthened by flying buttresses.

Within the wall lay fields of [[pundi rice]], both for home consumption and export; wheat and other grains; all manner of vegetables and fruits; and a complete array of livestock, both native and imported. The Castle was, in short, capable of total self-sufficiency in keeping with the desires of its original owner.

Various dwellings, comfortable if not grand, were provided on the estate for the retainers who tended all of its flora and fauna. A military barracks housed the detachment of
Atreides soldiers Wesle had been granted by his brother.
==Castle==
The Castle proper was centered on this tract of land and was constructed of the same beautifully tinted stone that made up the boundary wall. In its heyday the building was a
marvel: 
*20 fully outfitted bedroom suites, 
*a kitchen capable of feeding four thousand if completely utilized, 
*conservatories with plants from a hundred worlds, and
*a library which had been favorably compared to that of the Court on [[Kaitain/DE|Kaitain]]. 

More than two hundred servitors were employed in its maintenance. 

After the alterations of 9355 AG, walls were removed and rearranged to provide room for the extra servitors needed by a ruling House; the military barracks increased tenfold; and the already sturdy defenses were strengthened to full capacity, at which any but an all-out planetary attack could be rebuffed.

'''Paul Orestes Atreides''' ([[10175 AG/XD|10175 AG]] - [[10219 AG|10217 AG]])''',''' predominantely known as '''Muad'Dib''', was the first [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], the last [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] from [[10191 AG]] until [[10193 AG]], the first and founding [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] of the [[Atreides Empire]] from [[10193 AG]] until [[10207 AG/XD|10207 AG]], and the supreme religious leader of the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] as the accepted [[Mahdi]] from [[10193 AG]] onwards. The only son of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides]] <small>(née [[Nerus family|Nerus]])</small>, Paul's early years were overshadowed by correct suspicions of him as the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], achieved one generation early due to the disobedience of his mother in producing a son rather than a daughter. When he was only a few hours old, Paul was nearly killed by [[Mentat]] [[Piter de Vries/XD|Piter de Vries]], but was saved by Gaius Helen Mohiam, who, although bitter at her disobedience, returned him to his mother. 

When the Atreides were forced by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] into moving from their ancestral homeworld of [[Caladan]] to the desert planet of [[Arrakis]] when Paul was fifteen, he was tested with a [[Gom Jabbar|gom jabbar]] by Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], his success in this test proving him human in the eyes of the Sisterhood. On Arrakis, Paul experienced a supposed attempted assassination attempt using a hunter-seeker, although this was in reality staged by the Harkonnens, the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|historic enemies]] of the Atreides, in order to turn attention away from the traitor planted in the Atreides household, [[Suk Doctor|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]].

Following the [[Siege of Arrakeen]] which killed his father and decimated the Atreides, Paul and his mother were taken in by the [[Fremen]] tribe of [[Sietch Tabr]] after escaping the Harkonnens and the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]], where Paul killed for the first time in a duel with the Fremen [[Jamis]]. After this fight, Paul took the name [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] among the Fremen and found himself becoming a leader among them, and became a good friend to Tabr [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] and the lover of his niece [[Chani Kynes]].

Fuelled by the historic prophecies of the [[Lisan al Gaib|Lisan al-Gaib]] planted by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] centuries ago, Paul found himself inching closer and closer to great power. The years he spent on Arrakis, also saw his mother Jessica drinking the [[Water of Life]], an act which allowed her to become a Reverend Mother and one which Paul later went through with himself, and the birth of his [[Pre-born|preborn]] sister, [[Alia Atreides]]. Paul also trained the Fremen in the weirding way of the Bene Gesserit to make them into the guerilla warriors known as the [[Fedaykin]], allowing them to deal serious blows against the Harkonnens and turn the tide in the ongoing [[Desert War]] against them. When the Emperor decided to come to Arrakis himself to crush Muad'Dib and get spice production back on track, Paul launched the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in his use of [[Great Convention|forbidden]] [[atomics]] in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], a battle which also saw the death of [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|his first son]].

Finally meeting the Emperor personally, Paul revealed to Shaddam that he would destroy all of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet in a chain reaction if he did not allow him to take the Imperial throne, leading to chaos across the [[Known Universe]]. After killing his cousin [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] in a kanly duel, the Emperor and the [[Spacing Guild]] submitted to Paul's will and he was Emperor within three years. Despite his love and loyalty to his concubine Chani, Paul married [[Princess Royal|Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino]] in his quest for the Emperor's seat in the [[Landsraad]], but found navigating this relationship complex and difficult at times.

After ruling his new [[Atreides Empire]] for twelve years, during which the galaxy was at war in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a jihad]] which the [[Fedaykin]] spread across the universe, Paul was blinded by a [[stone burner]] in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a final conspiracy]] against the Atreides throne, but managed to see through his [[Prescience|prescient]] abilites. This presceience-sight ended after the birth of his twin children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], coinciding with Chani's death, and he walked into the desert according to Fremen Law, his sister Alia becoming [[Regent]] of the empire. In the ensuing times he became known as the Preacher, an identity he held for nine years before he was murdered while preaching his 'heresy', shortly after accepting the [[Golden Path]] planned by his son Leto II, who inherited the Imperium as [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] not long after his death and the suicide of his [[Ego-memory|possessed]] sister Alia.

== Biography ==

=== Family lineage ===
[[File:Dune 2020 House Atreides.jpg|thumb|The Atreides were an ancient Great House dating back to the time of Agamemnon on Old Earth.]]
[[House Atreides]] was an old and wealthy [[Houses Major|House Major]] in the [[Landsraad]], tracing their lineage back thousands of years to [[King Agamemnon]], a son of [[Atreus]] in [[Greece]] on [[Earth|Old Earth]]. The Atreides had a long-standing [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] with [[House Harkonnen]] dating back ten thousand years to the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The family kept their ancestral world of [[Caladan]] a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to the Harkonnen capital of [[Giedi Prime]]. However, the Atreides were also proficient in war; they maintained [[Swordmaster|Swordmasters]], [[Warmaster|Warmasters]] and [[Mentat|Mentats]] to train and lead their army, and had even developed their own [[Battle Language]].

The [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] brought Paul's parents, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica Nerus]], who was secretly the natural daughter of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], together in [[10174 AG]], with the intention of producing an Atreides daughter who could then mate with [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]] the Sisterhood had long prepared for. However, the Bene Gesserit plans were thrown into disarray when Jessica, due to her deep love of the Duke Leto, bore a male heir, Paul, to his House rather than a girl.

=== Birth {{C|10175}} ===
{{Quote|When the original [[Jessica Atreides/XD | Jessica]] gave birth to the original Paul, it was a time of political intrigues, assassinations, and conspiracies that resulted in the death of [[Lady]] [[Anirul Corrino/XD | Anirul]], wife of [[Padishah Emperor/XD | Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD | Shaddam IV]], and the near murder of the baby.|The nature of the time of Paul's birth|Hunters of Dune}}<p style="text-align: left;">Jessica kept the gender of her son in secret until she was summoned to the Imperial capital to give birth to her child. Because of the importance of this unborn child, [[Lady]] [[Anirul Corrino]], [[Kwisatz Mother/XD|Kwisatz Mother]] of the the Bene Gesserit and wife of the [[Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]], supervised his birth. Even after the stunning revelation during delivery that the child was a male, Anirul decided that Paul must live and be protected. As Anirul and the Bene Gesserit staff realized that an assassin was in the Imperial Palace, Lady Anirul realized she had to help kill the murderer herself.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">During Jessica's rigorous labor, Anirul found the murderer alone in the Palace but she is mortally wounded, and [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]] was able to kill the murderer. The Imperial intruder turned out to be the [[twisted]] [[mentat]], [[Piter de Vries/XD|Piter de Vries]], agent of [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]]. As word got out about de Vries' killing of Anirul, the capital city, [[Corrinth City]], went into turmoil.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After arriving in Kaitain, Leto quickly searched throughout the Imperial Palace, and once he found Jessica and Paul, they quickly left for [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. A few weeks later, during the announcement of Paul's birth to the citizens of [[Cala City]], far away, on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], giant sandworms performed a mystical rite beneath the light of Dune's second moon.</p>

=== Early life {{C|10175-10191}} ===

==== Upbringing ====
{{Quote|At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.|from [[A Child’s History of Muad‘Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}[[File:Youngpaulatreides.png|thumb|A young Paul Atreides ]]

<p style="text-align: left;">As the son of Duke Leto Atreides I, Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-covered planet of Caladan, the ancestral home of House Atreides. Though he lacked companions his own age, he did recieve tuition from his teachers, men like [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] and [[Wellington Yueh|Doctor Yueh]], as well as education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday in [[10191 AG]], Paul's father revealed to him that Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a [[mentat]]. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. Paul's latent talents also earned him the attention of the Bene Gesserit, who tested him with the [[Golden Lion Throne|Gom Jabbar]] as they hoped to salvage their breeding program through him.</p>
====War of Assassins of 10,187 ====
<blockquote>''Main article: [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]''</blockquote><p style="text-align: left;">During the last [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG|War of Assassins]] between [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]], the Atreides family became involved when [[Ilesa Ecaz]], the intended bride of Duke Leto, was killed just before marrying him. The entire planet went on lockdown, and while Leto prepared his attack force to meet the Moritani's on their home planet of [[Grumman]], his son Paul, who has left in Idaho's care in [[Castle Caladan/XD|Castle Caladan]], was attacked shortly thereafter in his bedchamber.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Duncan arranged an escape into the night, flying with Paul in an ornithopter to Caladan's sparsely populated [[Eastern Continent]]. While fleeing, Paul and Duncan were ruthlessly hunted throughout all of the continent's dense forest overgrowth. The two eventually made friends with [[Caladan primitive]]s, who helped them escape from the assassins over the course of the following week.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually, Duncan arranged for Paul and himself to gain entry to the abbey of the [[Sisters in Isolation]], home in exile of Paul's grandmother, Lady [[Helena Atreides]]. The two rested and refreshed themselves as Paul met his cold demeanored grandmother for the first time. After the Moritani assassins found them, they bombarded and burned down the entire abbey, killing almost everyone inside, including Paul's grandmother. [[Swain Goire]], the Lady's bodyguard, who accompanied her in exile, gave his life, in a last ditch effort to allow Duncan and Paul to escape. Later, in the deep jungle, the Caladan primitives set traps for the assassins, as they came to understand the kindness of House Atreides, and their just rule over the planet.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As the Atreides and Ecaz families joined forces, they landed on the planet Grumman. [[Hundro Moritani]] led his forces into open battle on the salt plains near the planet's capital city, [[Ritka]].</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Paul learned this way the bloody nature of battle, as he saw the hand-to-hand combat experienced by both sides; and it changed Paul's nature thence-forward. Later, when Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV landed near Ritka to enforce a peace treaty, Paul saw the treachery exhibited by Viscount Moritani as he threatened to blow up the entire city and plain with nuclear devices. No longer would the 12-year old Atreides view the world in naivete', but would be prepared.</p>

====Tessia Struck====

A year later, in [[10188 AG]], Jessica and Paul visited [[Ix/XD|Ix]] so that Paul could spend time as an exchange student in [[Vernii]] City, just as his father had done decades earlier. To Jessica's dismay, while there, the Bene Gesserit [[guilt-caster]] [[Stokia]] and three other Sisters visited [[Tessia]] Vernius. They demanded that Tessia produce more children for the Bene Gesserit breeding program, which Tessia refused. Unbeknownst to Jessica, Stokia used her [[psychic]] powers to put Tessia into a comatose trance, which rendered Tessia helpless. Rhombur was unable to help his poor wife, and Dr. Yueh could do nothing to help her, who began to waste away. The Sisterhood demanded that Tessia be take with them to Wallach IX, where they would nurse her and take care of her. In grief, Rhombur let them take his wife away.

==== Running with Bronso ====
Later that day, Rhombur decided to tell his son, [[Bronso Vernius]], that he was the artificially conceived son of [[Tyros Reffa]]. Bronso, who was 11 years old, reacted bad and encouraged Paul to run away with him off-world. Paul, under the oath to Duke Leto "to protect Bronso", accompanied him.

<p style="text-align: left;">Though his time with the Jongleur performing group was less than a month, Paul was able to remember many of the techniques that the Jongleurs had taught him about mass hypnosis, and he was later able to use them to cement his rule amongst the Fremen, and later as [[Emperor]].</p>
====Death of Earl Rhombur====
A few days later, House Atreides received information that both arrived first to [[Chusuk/XD|Chusuk]], and now could be found on [[Balut]] with a [[Jongleur]] performing group. When Jessica and the rest of the searchers from House Atreides and [[House Vernius]] arrived on Balut, they found both Bronso and Paul well treated by the performing group. The Jongleur group was to give a performance in honor of the Governor of Balut's upcoming marriage in the planet's famed [[Theater of Shards]]. Paul was able to sense that an assassination attempt was planned.

Paul saved the life of the planetary Governor [[Alra Kio]], but when Rhombur pushed Balut's leader out of the way, the intense sound blast hit him, and ravaged his body. All present recoiled in horror as Rhombus died, and Bronso cradled his dying father.

Just before Rhombur died, he whispered his last words to his son, "Is Paul safe?" Deeply hurt that his father did not speak of him or his mother while dying, Bronso cast Jessica and the rest of House Atreides out of his life for the next 12 years. The Atreides returned to Caladan.
===Desert War {{C|10191-10193}}===

==== Move to Arrakis ====
{{Quote|On that first day when Muad‘Dib rode through the streets of [[Arrakeen]] with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: “[[Mahdi]]!” But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the [[Lisan al Gaib | Lisan al-Gaib]], the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a [[Bene Gesserit]] and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.|from [[Manual of Muad’Dib]] by the [[Irulan Corrino/XD | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}
[[File:Ha paul hunterseeker-1.png|thumb|Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in the first months on Arrakis.]]
Paul accompanied his parents when [[House Atreides]] relocated to the desert world of [[Arrakis]] to manage mining operations of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. Before their departure, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor's [[Truthsayer]], tested him with the [[gom jabbar]]. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

After a supposed assassination on Paul using a hunter-seeker, Dr Yueh lowered the defensive house shields and used sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught in the [[Siege of Arrakeen]]. The Atreides army was crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape. This attack marked the beginning of the War. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] were sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needed to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan was foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hated the Baron and wished to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to kill their captors and escape into the desert.

==== With Kynes and Idaho ====
Paul and Jessica initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flde to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they had died from a coriolis storm.

==== Alliance with the Fremen ====
[[File:Ha paul jamis fight1-1.png|thumb|Paul fights Jamis to the death.]]
In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers came into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures exploded into awareness. He saw many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he could make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive. After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] proved their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu training – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepted them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also met a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], whom he had long seen in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarmed a proud Fremen, Jamis, who took offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenged Paul to a fight to the death. Although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphed easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. Stilgar gave Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gave himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.
[[File:Paul Atreides with Maker hooks (Frank Herbert's Dune, 2000, Sci-Fi Channel).jpg|thumb|Paul preparing to first ride a sandworm]]
When they returned to the troop's sietch, they discovered the Fremen Reverend Mother was near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they made Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen were about to do, accepted to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realized she has made a mistake, that she was involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who could see genetic memories, and realized that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, would also go through the process. This had truly unfortunate consequences, because it was a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby would not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.

By [[10193 AG]], two years later, Paul had become something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani became his lover and bore him a son, whom he called Leto. He and his mother trained the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who sought out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experienced victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grew. However, in order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he had to become a [[sandrider]]. Paul attempted it and succeeded, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr sprung a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognised his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and called on him and his men to surrender. Gurney was overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrendered his men, and joined Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, were some Imperial spies who attempted to kill Paul. They were unsuccessful, and they were captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gave secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lived on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul used the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he had become a wormrider many of his followers had expected him to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul broke tradition and in doing so forced Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus took power without killing his friend. They returned to Sietch Tabr. Gurney was shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believed she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul did not know. Gurney was about to kill her when Paul walked in, managed to stop him, and explained that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney was almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgived him and he was bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

Paul's power among the Fremen grew, but he was still frustrated. He was not all he could be: he could not control his journeys into the future, and much of it was still blank to him. So he took a truly risky step and consumed a tiny amount of spice essence, and so attempted to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man had survived this experience, and it seemed that he failed also, because he sank into a coma. Paul neglected to tell anyone what he is doing; many people thought he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believed he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, did all she can to wake him but failed, so out of desperation she called Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realised what a mad thing Paul has done, and used spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time had passed, and he gloried in his new memories and powers — he told his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself was currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He had proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declared that it was now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he came to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levied of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again. By now the Emperor was aware of who Muad'Dib was. In advance of his arrival, he sent a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they managed to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but were driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

==== Battle of Arrakeen  ====
After the Emperor himself had landed, Paul launched the final attack. Using the House Atriedes' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blew a hole in the Shield Wall that protected the capital of Arrakeen from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoided contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". The Fremen attacked under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorted out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar were unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they were in total surprise, and the Emperor was forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loomed in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatened to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they backed off. In the surprise of Muad'Dib's attack, Alia managed to escape, and in the process killed the Baron Harkonnen.

Realizing that Muad'dib was not some mad Fremen religious leader changed the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenged Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Paul agreed even knowing that it is possible he would die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempted treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphed.

=== As Emperor {{C|10193-10207}} ===

==== Coronation ====
[[File:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|Paul replaced Shaddam IV as Emperor of the Known Universe]]
Paul refused to take any more nonsense. He forced the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who controlled space travel. He again threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul is capable of it – and they sent everyone home. The Emperor abdicated and retired to Salusa Secundus. Paul married the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], and assumed control of the Empire. Irulan later wrote extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought. Paul then [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|sent a Fremen jihad across the known universe]].

Upon crowning himself Emperor, Paul enacted a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the [[Fremen]] thrust into the whole of the Empire. A result of this action was that Paul Atreides himself became a revered god-head on many worlds in the [[Known Universe]]. There was resistance, and Paul found himself increasingly isolated from his family and friends as he decided that the Jihad to implement his vision of mankind's future must be bloodthirsty and relentless. 

==== Kaitain speech ====
Paul arrived on Kaitain in [[10196 AG/XD|10196 AG]], two years after the ruinous [[Sack of Kaitain]], to address the Landsraad for the first time since assuming the Royal Throne, the Emperor explained that the destruction of Kaitain was the

true ending of the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]]. Many of the nobles fell into line behind [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. Others, such as [[Earl]] [[Memnon Thorvald]], of [[House Thorvald]], had witnessed the sack of Kaitain firsthand, stormed out of the Assembly, to foment a rebellion.</p>

====Assassination attempts====

 Paul was also the target of many assassination attempts. The first was not an actual assassination attempt, as Paul initially believed. This was the [[Great Surrender]] ceremony in [[10198 AG/XD|10198 AG]], at the dedication of his new Palace in [[Arrakeen]]. The plot was orchestrated by a misguided [[Swordmaster]] [[Whitmore Bludd]], who wanted to be able to die a hero saving Paul. The attempt killed his sister-in-law, [[Rugi Corrino]], as she was representing the former Royal House at the galaxy-wide event.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The second attempt later that year was a twisted and convoluted attempt involving the former Count, [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]]; his wife [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]]; and their daughter, the gifted [[Marie Fenring]]. In regards to Fenring, Paul's [[prescience]] constantly failed and provided little insight due to Hasimir's genetic make-up of a failed Kwisatz.</p>

{{Quote|All relationships change, Count Fenring, and as humans we must adapt to them or die.|Paul Atreides in [[10198 AG]]|Paul of Dune}}

As a result, at a banquet in honor of the Fenring's, Marie attempted to attack and stab the Emperor, but instead, was killed by Alia. In grief, Hasimir thrusted the [[Emperor's Blade]] deep into Paul's body, which brought him to the brink of death. Paul remembered that he had the abilities of a full [[Reverend Mother]]. While [[Suk]] doctors stitched the damaged organs of his body back together on the cellular level, he passed the [[Water of Life]] that [[Chani]] gave him to save his life. Paul exiled the Fenring couple permanently to [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]] to live out their days with the deposed Shaddam Corrino IV.

====Rise of Bronso====

<p style="text-align: left;">In a secret meeting, Paul arranged to meet his mother and the now restored realtionship with Bronso on the planet [[Ix]]. Suddenly Paul stepped out of the shadows, to explain to his mother the role of the Jihad.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Just before the meeting, Jessica had to resist the urge to kill her son, as she had been promised the [[Mother Superior]] leadership of the Sisterhood by Mohiam, if she murdered the Emperor. Jessica had hitherto been concerned about Paul being possessed by Abomination, since he had sterilized so many worlds for the [[Jihad]].</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Paul explained to Jessica that he ''had'' to sterilize those worlds, because the people that had looked upon him as some type of Messiah, have to learn the kind of tyranny that false messianic hopes could foster. After seeing his atrocities, mankind never would trust in one human for a type of salvation again. He calmly explained that he planned to sterilize even more worlds, but was secretly evacuating the populace of each world to limit the number of deaths. He also told her about Bronso's secret mission -- to write diatribes and publications about Paul's failings.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Over the next few years, as Bronso published and distributed writings about Paul's faults; the [[Qizarate]], Alia, and the Fremen wanted Bronso captured and punished. Bronso eventually was captured, and put into Paul's secure prison on Dune. Paul secretly dismissed the guards and opened the cell, allowing his friend to escape.</p>

====Final years as Emperor====

<p style="text-align: left;">After the bloody [[wikipedia:jihad|Jihad]] that lasted more than twelve years, and claimed billions of lives, Emperor Paul Atreides eventually subdued all outright rebellion. The order of the Known Universe was maintained through the replacement of Corrino imperial power, which was supported by Sardaukar military strength; with Atreides imperial power, supported by Fremen military strength.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Paul's interpretation of his prescient visions also necessitated that [[Arrakis]] be transformed from a barren desert planet into a lush and fertile world, with the exception of a small desert for the [[sandworm]] to remain alive and keep producing [[spice melange|spice]]. By the end of his rule this plan was well on its way to succeeding. This program had begun under [[Pardot Kynes]] as an attempt to harness a planet; however, under Paul, it became part of a plan to save humanity.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Despite his strong leadership and formidable prescient abilities, Emperor Paul Atreides began to feel building pressure from discordant groups within the Empire: notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Bene Tleilax]], fringe groups within the [[Fremen]], and the dethroned but still powerful [[House Corrino]]. Among the schemes of his enemies were the detonation of a [[stone burner]] near where Paul and his forces stood in [[Arrakeen]], which resulted in his physical blindness. Upon Paul's recovery from this incident, he shocked all by his ability to 'see' despite not having eyes. His perfect prescient abilities allowed him to perceive the world around him.</p>

=====Death of Chani=====

<p style="text-align: left;">Despite being able to 'see' through prescience, doubts began to surface in Paul's mind regarding his interpretation of the future. Feeling increasingly frustrated and out of control, he began to seek a way out. That escape route emerged through the combined treachery of his enemies, a plot conceived in the presence of a powerful [[Guild Navigator]]. The [[Bene Tleilax]] gave him a [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], who contained a secret trigger. Concurrently, and part of the plan, Irulan slowly poisoned Chani. As the Princesses' toxins slowly worked their way through Chani's body, the [[Chani Kynes|Emperor's Consort]] died during childbirth. [[Image:Leto, Paul & Chani Scytale's Offer.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Paul contemplates life with a ghola of Chani and his newborn children]] Immediately, the [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]], who had been posing as Chani's hand-maid sprung into action, and caused the Idaho ghola to remember his Tleilaxu mission, to kill [[Muad'Dib]]. As this caused a great mental conflict within Duncan, he remembered his past with [[House Atreides]]. Immediately, Scytale realized the great scope of change that had occurred, a ghola had recovered memories of its former life. Scytale bargained with Paul that the Tleilaxu could bring back a ghola of Chani, complete with her life experiences, for Paul to enjoy in realitive obscurity--if Atreides would abdicate. Instead, Paul killed Scytale.</p>

=====Walk into the Desert=====

<p style="text-align: left;">After the birth of his children, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], Paul became convinced he had lost his prescient abilities; he did not forsee the birth of his son, only his daughter. Therefore, as a no more than a blind Fremen, Paul disappeared into the desert, offering himself up to [[Shai-Hulud]], as was the Fremen custom for the blind.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This action made a powerful statement: it signified to the Fremen that Paul's interest was for the tribe, and that even he, Usul, Paul who was Muad'Dib, was not above Fremen law.</p>

===As The Preacher {{C|10207-10217}}===
[[Image:Preacher01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Preacher addresses a crowded marketplace in Arrakeen, thundering against Alia's regency]] Many years after his apparent death alone in the desert, and while the [[Atreides Empire]] was under the regency of his younger sister [[Alia Atreides]], a new figure, [[The Preacher]], appeared from the deep desert.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">By urging [[wikipedia:civil disobedience|civil disobedience]] against the [[Atreides Empire]], and warning of the consequences of a green [[Arrakis]], [[The Preacher]] attracted an ever increasing number of followers. Many believed this thundering blind stranger to be Paul Atreides, as he was blind and led by a boy.</p>

==== Death ====
<p style="text-align: left;">The Preacher eventually revealed himself to his son Leto, and the two of them travelled throughout Arrakis, breaching the water storage of every sietch so that it would spill out onto the sand. Eventually Leto and the Preacher returned to Arrakeen to confront Alia, who had clearly shown herself to be [[Abomination]] by this time. Eventually rising tensions saw Alia commit suicide in front of her mother and Duncan Idaho. During the ensuing chaos, [[The Preacher]] was assassinated in [[Arrakeen]], but not before he had revealed beyond a doubt to Gurney Halleck and Jessica that he was indeed Paul Atreides.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thus, the great Paul Atreides, son of Leto the Just and the first Atreides to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] since its inception more than ten thousand years prior, was dead, passing into legend for eons to come, laying the way forward for his son to take the Golden Path to its logical conclusion.#</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">While Paul envisioned the Golden Path, the ultimate transformation that would see his humanity dissolve into a sandworm frightened him. Upon revealing himself to his son, Paul confessed that his desire to maintain his humanity, and the fear of abject loneliness that the Golden Path would bring, were too much for him. He related that he walked away from what he knew he had to do, and admired but lamented for his son who had taken on the mantle that would see humanity restored, but at the cost of his own.</p>

=== Gholas during Kralizec {{C|15246-15264}} ===

==== On the ''Ithaca'' ====
After the long periodf the reign of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], followed by the [[The Scattering|Scattering]], the end of the age and the coming of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]] began. [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] and [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]], with various crew and captives, escaped in the [[No-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]'', from the [[New Sisterhood]] capital of [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]]. They were subsequently pursued by the [[Ones of Many Faces/XD|Outside Enemy]], who tried to ensnare them in their [[Tachyon net/XD|Tachyon net]], but the ''Ithaca'' escaped by folding space.

As the Ithaca began its' journey from one part of the Universe to another, it was revealed that one member aboard the ship, [[Scytale]], a [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]], had cells of  leaders from mankind's history, including Paul and many others, which he kept in a Nullentropy tube. Sheeana and her supporters chose to create a ghola of Paul among others.

==== Paolo ====
Upon the urging of Khrone, the [[Lost Tleilaxu]] [[scribe]] [[Uxtal]], created the ghola of Paul named '''Paolo''' in an [[Axlotl Tank]] in Bandalong. Upon his subsequent reaching the age of being a toddler, the ghola of [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], created nine years earlier, became jealous of Paolo. Harkonnen would complain of Paolo, whom he said reminded him of a constantly mewing cat. It was at this time that Khrone told Harkonnen that Paolo was a very important individual, far more important than Vladimir himself.

As Paolo reached the age of four, Khrone decided that it would be best for Paolo to be raised on the [[Atreides]] home-world of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], where he and Vladimir were subsequently taken. At that time, Harkonnen was formally given the charge of raising the young clone, and mandated that Vladimir eradicate all aspects of any kind of Atreides upbringing.

As the years rolled by, Harkonnen continued with Paolo's training, and was especially nice to Paolo, as he was told that the ghola may indeed be the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, even though Vladimir had never believed in such prophecies. During the latter part of his first decade, Paolo began to have visions that involved [[prescience]] about his future. In his perceptions, he would see recurring foresights of himself, battling another older version of himself. In the vision, he would always be victorious holding a [[knife]].

As the end of the age approached and Paolo approached the age of maturity, Khrone once again appeared and announced that the Thinking Machine rulers wanted Paolo brought to [[Synchrony]]; where they could meet, continue to educate, and test the young ghola. It was revealed to the now 11 year old Paolo, that he was believed to be a super-being, and would help the Machines rule human-kind. Once upon the planet, Erasmus continued Paolo's training, especially in the area of martial arts and fighting abilities.

==== Paul versus Paolo ====
As the events of [[Kralizec]] unfolded, the [[no-ship]] ''[[Ithaca]]'' was captured and brought to Synchrony in [[15264 AG]]. The entire crew was disembarked, and the [[ghola]] of Paul Atreides, who had been raised aboard the ship, was brought to the heart of Synchrony, the [[Cathedral]]. Based upon Erasmus' [["mathematical projections"]], Omnius decided the two Paul's would duel-to-the death in one-on-one combat, as he believed that the victor between the two would be the stronger, and hence the Ultimate super-being. Paul was severely wounded and Paolo, victorious, collected his prize; a quantity of [[Ultraspice]].

After he ingested a massive amount of the enhanced [[melange]], Paolo's [[prescience]] was enhanced exponentially, and he began to see almost all aspects of the universe. With the melange having coursed fully through his veins, Paolo also experienced and saw all actions of humanity into the future, as well as those of the past. Paolo soon realized that he was unable to communicate with those around him, became delirious, and he fell into an irreversible, persistent trance-coma.

Even though the events of Kralizec unfolded just yards away from him; Paul's self-healing, the banishment of Omnius by the [[Oracle of Time]], the death of all [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s activated by Erasmus in response to Khrone's failed attempted coup'; Paolo was completely unaware of them. Slowly over the course of the next few days, Paolo starved and thirsted to death, as he was unable to eat or drink.
== Abilities and skills ==
*'''[[Prescience]]''': As the Kwisatz Haderach long sought out for by the breeding programme of the Bene Gesserit Order, Paul possessed a powerful ability to bridge space and time with prescient ability. From an early age, he experienced visions in his dreams which were reported to the Sisterhood by his mother Jessica and was known to have had visions that were accurate, penetrating, and defied four-dimensional explanation. This was one of the key attributes that made them first suspect him being their long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach achieved early. Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Paul's prescient ability was strengthened by the spice melange he constantly inhaled, and it grew greatest during his alliance with the Fremen people, when he first forsaw the jihad that would be waged across the Known Universe in his name, and began to try and avert it. By the end of his reign, Paul's prescience was so powerful that when he lost his eyesight due to a Tleilaxu stone burner, he could interact with the world around him without aid. This was because he was able to remember all the details of his vision of the future. Essentially, Paul knew where everyone would be and what they would say and do. While this helped him in many situations, it was also ultimately his downfall as he was helpless to prevent his future.
*'''[[Weirding Way]]''': Paul was trained by his mother in the Weirding Way of the Bene Gesserit, allowing him to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. When first encountering Sietch Tabr this saved his life, as he was able to overcome the Fremen who saught to kill him and Jessica for their water by means of the Weirding Way. He later taught the Way to many of the Fremen across Arrakis, making them into skilled and deadly Fedaykin by these means, and this was a key factor in his victory in the Battle of Arrakeen.
*'''[[Voice]]''': At the time the Atreides landed on Arrakis, Paul was also developing the audio-neuro control mechanism of Voice used by the Sisterhood to achieve complete control over a reciever. He demonstrated his emerging talent in this field when, after the decimation of the Atreides and the capture of him and his mother into an ornithopter, he used the Voice to order a Harkonnen agent to remove Jessica's gag so that she could use it even more effectively against him, and thus saving both their lives.
*'''[[Prana-bindu|Prana-bindu control]]''': Paul was taught by the supreme control of nerve and muscles known to the Bene Gesserit as prana-bindu by Jessica, which laid the foundations for his use of the Weirding Way and allowed him to gain a higher control over his body which would come to his advantage at many points in his life.
*'''Swordfighting''': In addition to the Bene Gesserit techniques taught to him by his mother for his survival, Paul became a skilled swordfighter after years of training by his chief Atreides teachers, the renowned Swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, who he nearly bested shortly before the move to Arrakis. This proved to be a vital skill, as he employed it not only to best Jamis after he declared amtal during his early years in Sietch Tabr, but later to kill his cousin, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, another skilled fighter, in a kanly duel at the time of his ascension to Emperor.
*'''[[Mentat]] training''': For the first fifteen years of his life, much of Paul's training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a Mentat by order of his father Duke Leto. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as the Duke of the Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a Mentat-Duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. He became a fully fledged "true" Mentat after first escaping the Harkonnens with his mother, and the high level Mentat abilities he gained at that time would help him at many points in his life, including helping handle the data of the battles of his jihad and allowing him to piece together the nature of the conspiracies which were aimed against him more quickly than he could have otherwise.
*'''Endurance''': Paul's unusual endurance, especially for a male, was noted by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam when she tested him with a gom jabbar, a test which he passed through this skill. She noted that he surmounted more agony in the test than any other human of record.
== Relationships==

=== Leto Atreides I ===
{{Quote|How do we approach the study of Muad‘Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there—aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?|from [[Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries]] by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Dune (novel)}}Paul respected his father Leto, the penultimate Atreides Duke, who had hopes for a great future for his son as a Mentat-Duke. When Paul was nearly killed by a hunter-seeker in a supposed assassination attempt, Leto grew enraged at his Mentat Thufir, who had failed to detect the trap, and was angry that the Harkonnens had tried to take the life of his son. Paul was greatly disturbed when he heard Reverend Mother Mohiam tell his mother: "for the father, nothing", and had an urge to tell Leto what she had said, although he never did. Leto felt like Paul was one of the only people to whom he could reveal his weaknesses and fears as well as entrust the fact that he had never distrusted Jessica, a fact which he told Paul to reveal to her if he never could, and which he did after Leto's death.

=== Chani Kynes ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Paul|You're the strong one, Chani. Stay with me.|Chani|Always.|Paul and Chani's love|Dune (novel)}}Paul first encountered Chani Kynes, daughter of the great Planetologist Liet-Kynes, during him and Jessica's initial encounter and fight with the Fremen, but by that point he had dreamed of her many times. Stilgar told her to keep Paul out of trouble and Chani helped Paul in his fight with Jamis by warning him that Jamis fought with either hand, and that he should keep his mind on the knife and not on the hand that held it. From that point they grew closer, calling each other Usul and Sihaya, and she ultimately became his concubine, and the mother of his first son, Leto Atreides II the Elder, who was killed by Sardaukar in the Battle of Arrakeen. After Paul's ascension to Emperor Chani was considered his true wife rather than his titular wife, the Princess Irulan, and became the mother of two further children with Paul, Ghanima and Leto II, before her death. The love between them was shown by her last word: Usul.

=== Duncan Idaho ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Paul had a close bond with his Swordmaster teacher Duncan Idaho, who trained him from his earliest years, and he was greatly distraught when Idaho fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, he found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Hasimir Fenring ===
{{Dialogue a-b|Shaddam IV|Kill this upstart for me. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from long effort and he’d be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now ... you know the way of it. Kill him. Do it!|Hasimir Fenring|Majesty, I must refuse.|Count Fenring refuses to kill Paul|Dune (novel)}}Paul first met Count Hasimir Fenring in 10193 AG during his final confrontation with Emperor Shaddam IV, the Count's closest friend, following the Battle of Arrakeen. Upon seeing the Count Paul felt extreme shock, as he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures—but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions. When the Emperor ordered Fenring to kill Paul, he realised that this was because the Count was a failed Kwisatz Haderach, and looking into Fenring's eyes he felt a deep compassion for the Count flow through him, the first sense of brotherhood he’d ever experienced. Seeing this, Fenring refused to kill him, accompaning the Emperor into exile on Salusa Secundus afterwards.

The true bond that existed between Paul and Fenring was shown once again when in 10198 AG the Count attempted to assassinate him after coming to Arrakis obstensibly simply to have his wife's daughter Marie grow up their rather than on Tleilax. Paul did not expect this to be the truth but he invited Fenring to have a drink anyway, and after the first initial supposed attempt through Marie, her death, and the direct true attempt by Fenring, Paul refused to have him killed and instead re-exiled him to Salusa with the Emperor. The respect held by the Count for Paul was also shown by the lapse between him being given the Emperor's Blade by Shaddam in 10194 AG and being compelled by the former Emperor to assassinate Paul and the actual attempt, and the reluctance when it finally came, followed by not very much disappointment on Fenring's part when he failed.

=== Gaius Helen Mohiam ===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Paul Atreides|Try your tricks on me, old witch. Where’s your [[gom jabbar]]? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You’ll find me there staring out at you! Have you nothing to say?|Gaius Helen Mohiam|I welcomed you to the ranks of [[human]]s. Don’t besmirch that.|Observe her, comrades! This is a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]], patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters—ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach | one person]] their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand... but... I ... will ... never... do ... her... bidding!”|[[Jessica Atreides | Jessica]]! Silence him!|Paul defies Reverend Mother Mohiam|Dune (novel)}}First meeting the aged Reverend Mother Mohiam when she visited Caladan to test him with a gom jabbar, Paul took instant dislike to the 'old crone', complaining about how she addressed his mother and how she treated him. When Mohiam ordered him to sit as her mother did, he told her that he was not his mother and he preferred to stand, from which she ordained that he hated her a little. Despite being judged human by Mohiam in the test, these feelings continued. He encountered Mohiam again during his final confrontation with the Emperor, terrifying her with his final ultimatum of destroying all melange after pointing out her reliance on spice as a Reverend Mother. She recognised that Paul was indeed the Kwisatz Haderach as she had long suspected. Paul declared that he was indeed the One but he would never to her bidding, and that for her role with the Emperor he could gladly have her strangled, but he thought it better punishment that she should live out her years never able to bend him to the Bene Gesserit schemes. He retained this opinion to the last, telling Alia not to execute Mohiam for her role in the conspiracy against him shortly before his walk into the desert, although she disobeyed him.

== Name ==
{{Quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.|[[Stilgar]] |Dune (novel)}}

=== Etymology ===
Paul's full name being '''Paul Orestes Atreides''', he was named after both his grandfather, [[Duke]] [[Paulus Atreides]], and [[Orestes]] in the [[Greece|Greek]] mythology of [[Earth/XD|Old Earth]]. His surname, that of his family of [[House Atreides]], meant "son of Atreus" in Greek, due to the Atreides' descent from [[Agamemnon]], Orestes' father and the son of [[Atreus]].

The name '''Muad'Dib''', given by Stilgar after Paul bested Jamis in amtal, was taken from the Fremen name for the kangeroo mouse of the Arrakis desert. While he originally called himself '''Paul-Muad'Dib''' after accepting this name, as to not completely remove the name given by his father, this did not become a common name and by his time as Emperor he was generally called only Muad'Dib. While this was the open way to refer to Paul, it was also decided after Jamis' death that the private name used within the sietch would be '''Usul''', meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar" in the Fremen language. He was also called '''Abu Dhur''' or '''Abu d' Dhur'''.

=== Titles ===
In addition to being the '''Kwisatz Haderach''' long sought for by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, Paul was known as both the '''Lisan al-Gaib''' and the '''Mahdi''' to the Fremen. The vanquished of his jihad called him '''the Tyrant''', a title which would later be used more widely to describe his son, the God Emperor, after his assassination. In his nine years as a nameless blind Fremen after walking into the desert, Paul was known by the title of '''the Preacher''' in absence of any name that could be given to him. He was given the postthumous title of the '''Mentat Emperor''' by the Mahdi Spirit Cult. He was given the title of '''Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time''' while being called Abu Dhur by Stilgar and later his son Leto II, who also called him the '''Fil-Haquiqa''' and '''The Reality'''. 

=== In earlier stages ===
In the original ''[[Spice Planet (story)|Spice Planet]]'' which evolved into ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Paul was called '''Barri Linkam'''. 

==Behind the Scenes==

<p style="text-align: left;">In the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie ''Dune'']], the role of Paul was played by long time ''Dune'' fan [[wikipedia:Kyle MacLachlan|Kyle MacLachlan]]. In interviews, McLachlan related that when reading ''Dune'' for the first time as a teenager, he imagined himself as being Paul Atreides, and to be provided the opportunity to portray him in a big budget film was a dream come true for him.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003]] Sci-Fi Channel mini-series Paul was played by [[wikipedia:Alec Newman|Alec Newman]]. The actor, who has a Scottish accent, reportedly adapted an American accent in a relatively short span of time just to land the role. In the 2000 miniseries, Paul was initially portrayed as a sort of "spoiled brat" in order to show the audience his growth from Atreides heir to Emperor of the Known universe.</p>

'''Duke Leto Atreides I''' ([[10140 AG]] - [[10191 AG]]), sometimes called '''Leto the Just''' or the '''Red Duke''', was the twentieth [[duke]] of [[House Atreides]] and the father of [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]] and [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]] with [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]], [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]]. Well known for his even-handed and compassionate leadership style, Leto ruled over [[Caladan]], and later [[Arrakis]], all while at war with the powerful [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Harkonnen]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|10140-10156}} ===
Paulus educated Leto with methods which Helena disagreed; he made him worked with villagers (had spent a month working in the [[pundi rice]] fields) and socialized with citizens and commoners.

When he was 14 years old he was sent for a formal education on [[Ix/XD|Ix]], where he became friend of [[Rhombur Vernius|Rhombur]] and [[Kailea Vernius|Kailea]], sons of the reigning [[House Vernius]]. There he underwent hours of high-tech physical and mental training, with added time for tours to the technological facilities and instruction in business philosophy. To complete his physical training, every third morning, the friends worked out on the automated training floor under master [[Zhaz]].

It was the growing astuteness of Leto that caused him to observe the growing discontent of the lowest class of Ixian workers, the [[suboid]]s. Leto observed while walking incognito amongst them, their growing discontent with Ixian flirtations with producing robotic items which might break the law on [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machines]]. This malcontent boiled over when the suboids were prompted into revolution during the [[Tlulaxa|Tleilaxu]] invasion of Ix at the start of [[Project Amal]]. Leto, Kailea, and Rhombur, almost losing their lives, managed to escape from the planet.

Short time after, Leto became Duke when his father was killed by a [[Salusan bull]] during a bull-fighting event.

=== Dukedom {{C|10156-10191}} ===

====Trial by Forteiture====
Leto was known for his steady hand, and for always speaking his mind when it came to the truth. Despite being in office for only a short time, Leto insisted on testifying on behalf of [[House Vernius]] in front of the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]]. His staunch defense of the deposed [[House]], caught the attention of many noblemen, who were intrigued by the young man's honesty.

On the return trip home to Caladan from [[Kaitain]], Leto was caught in a [[Harkonnen]] ambush. They used their a new secret technological device, a [[no-ship|no-ship,]] to destroy a Tleilaxu vessel inside the [[Guild]] [[Heighliner]], making it appear that the Atreides vessel had done the deed. Once accused, Leto protesting his innocence, and demanded a [[Trial by Forfeiture]] in front of the Landsraad.

Leto traveled to Kaitain again to face his Tleilaxu accusers in front of the entire [[Imperium]]. Unbeknownst to him, the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] had delivered to then [[Crown Prince]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] a forged note supoposedly from Leto himself. In that note Leto appears to have knowledge of House Corrino's [[Project Amal]]. Actuality, Leto knew nothing, nor the Shaddam's growing fear of the Leto "spilling the beans".

As Leto faced the entire congress of nobility, watching with fear as the Lansraad was just about to pronounce judgment against him. The Crown Prince strode to the podium and announced to the entire assemblage that he wanted to start his reign with the "noble House Ateides" intact, and that Leto's reputation was impeccable. Shaddam gave his personal [[knife]], what has come to be known as the [[Emperor's Blade]], as a gift to Leto, and encouraged the Landsraad to confirm Leto's innocence, which they did, much to the dismay of the Tleilaxu and Harkonnen.

====Return to Caladan====
Leto returned to Caladan, exonerated and innocent, but with Kailea and Rhombus Vernius still exiled and dishonored. Leto felt pity for the beautiful Kailea, and decided gave her, his sincere desire to have children falling in love with her. After a year, she conceived a child, [[Victor Atreides]]. Leto loved Victor as any father would, but due to the disadvantage that [[House Vernius]] was in Empire-wide, refused to make him his ducal heir.

Over the years this situation caused bitterness to Kailea, and letting herself manipulate by her Lady-in-waiting [[Chiara]], began plotting against Leto. She believed that if Leto died, then House Atreides could be claimed by Victor, with herself as Regent. Kailea and Chiara arranged to obtain a bomb and planted it aboard the [[skyclipper]] airship that Leto would use to peruse and visit the planet's [[Western Continent]]. As results of the explosion, Victor was killed, Rhombur horribly maimed, and Leto survived relatively unscathed.

Kailea, after she realized that Chiara was a Harkonnen spy, killed her and committed suicide by jumping off the balcony of [[Castle Caladan/XD|Castle Caladan]].

====Marriages and family====
After the failed relationship with Kailea, Leto entered into a lasting relationship with a Bene Gesserit acolyte named [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica]]. After entering into the Atreides household, she was bestowed with the title of [[Lady]]. Jessica's instructions from the Bene Gesserit were to bear a daughter, so when she reached maturity, would mate with the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnen]] heir. The purpose of this was twofold, one reason obvious, the other, known only to the Bene Gesserit: to end the feud between the two Great Houses, and to produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach]].

Unfortunately for the Bene Gesserit, Jessica fell in love with Leto, and succumbed to his wishes to sire a son, Paul. Despite falling in love with Jessica himself, Leto never married Jessica. His refusal to marry Jessica was driven by his astute political insticts; he had developed a reputation among the other Great Houses and had become very popular in the Landsraad. While he remained single he ensured that House Atreides was open to political alliance with those other Houses.

====War of Assassins of 10,187====

Until Paul was twelve, the shadow of hatred grew between [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]]. Leto saw this as an opportunity of an alliance and decided to marry [[Archuduke]] [[Armand Ecaz]]'s daughter, [[Ilesa Ecaz]], as a way of furthering himself in the Imperial congress. Tensions rose between Jessica and Leto, especially when Paul accompanied him to the Ecaz homeworld to the betrothal ceremony of Leto and Ilesa.

Caladan was excited about the prospect of the Duke marrying. [[Cala City]] was decked out in full display, as nobility from off-world arrived for the ceremony. As Ilesa was being presented down the aisle by her father, the Archduke, hexagonal and sharp flying [[dagger]]s self-activated. Leto emerged unscathed from the vicious attack; but Ilesa and her personal bodyguard, [[Rivvy Dinari]], lost their lives. The attack was carried out by [[Hundro Moritani]], leader of House Moritani, self-exiled on planet [[Grumman]]; this event started the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]].

Truly grieved by Ilesa's death, Leto was even more dedicated to defeating House Moritani, and pledged the full might of the Atreides family against the Moritani. As Leto with [[Armand Ecaz]] re-inforcements attacked Grumman, it seemed evident that [[Ritka]], the planet capital, would soon fall. The Emperor Shaddam himself, acting as "peacemaker", arrived with [[Sardaukar]] troops in tow to end the War and enforce the cease-fire. [[Rabban/XD|Rabban Harkonnen]] was there too, as incognito member of his House.

Hundro announced to the entire delegation that House Moritani descended from disgraced [[House Tantor]], whom blown up [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]] almost 10,000 years earlier. He then told that he was going to kill himself, and all nobles and armies present, with the atomics stockpiled by his House. However, the Viscount's bodyguard, [[Hiih Resser]], had decided to disobey Hundro, and had never set the charges to the detonators on the nuclear devices.

=====Aftermath=====

Leto returned to Caladan with Paul even more decided not to marry, looked towards opening up other venues of unity within the Imperium. Given the intense hatred that existed between House Atreides and the House Harkonnen, to remain open and seem agreeable to an alliance, was considered a significant tactical advantage; as it enabled Leto to hedge his bets. This political acumen, while it won him many fans in the Imperium, also inspired the jealousy of the Emperor. He was deemed a threat by Shaddam Corrino IV, who decided to use the long established animosity between House Harkonnen and House Atreides to dispose of this troublesome Duke, and of House Atreides altogether.

==== Migration to Arrakis ====

[[Image:Leto-Atreides-1-Hurt.jpg|thumb|right|Leto Atreides I portrayed by actor William Hurt.]]"''Here I am, here I remain!''"

After almost two decades of rule on Caladan with the Lady Jessica, Leto was ordered by the Emperor to take over the planetary fief of Arrakis from House Harkonnen, and thus was required to move his House from Caladan to 'Dune'. Arrakis was a notoriously difficult planet to manage, but as the only source of the [[spice melange]], it was also unimaginably important. Thus the role brought both jeopardy and the jealousy of Leto's fellow noblemen among the Great Houses. Thus, Leto leapt at the chance to increase his standing in the Landsraad, even though he knew it would also put his House in great peril. Leto committed all his resources to the venture, and it was said that to illustrate this point to his people and the people of Arrakis, that upon his arrival he planted a flag upon the battlements at Arrakeen and proclaimed: "''Here I am, here I remain!''"

Leto's resolve was strengthened by a letter the Emperor had sent him upon his Arrival on Arrakis. Addressed to his "Noble Duke", the letter outlined that Leto was given House Corrino's full support to introduce and uphold the rule of the [[Faufreluches]]. This letter served to illustrate Corrino duplicity, for at the same time, Shaddam IV was plotting Leto's demise.

During consolidation of his rule over Arrakis, Leto made a quick and positive impact on the people of Dune. His fairhandedness, political savvy, and personal charisma saw many in Arrakeen society, from the [[Fremen]] to the aristocratic Houses Minor, become supporters. However, only a short while into Leto's rule on Dune, the Emperor gave Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] approval to invade and destroy House Atreides, even going so far as to provide some of his own [[Sardaukar]] in support. The Emperor's urgency in disposing of House Atreides was amplified by the fact that he had come to know that the Duke Leto had managed to develop a small force of soldiers capable of rivalling the Emperor's Sardaukar. This had been accomplished through Leto's principal advisors and generals, namely [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], and [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]].

===Death===
During the invasion Leto was betrayed by his private [[Suk]] Doctor, [[Wellington Yueh]], and turned over to the Harkonnens. Though Yueh had given Leto the chance to kill the Baron Harkonnen using a poisoned tooth embedded in the Duke's mouth, the scheme failed. Consequently Leto died during the assassination attempt, but the Baron Harkonnen survived - although his twisted mentat [[Piter de Vries/XD|Piter de Vries]] was killed by the poison.

Some years later, Leto's remains were recovered by his son Paul in [[Arrakeen]]. Paul laid his father's remains to rest in the [[Skull Tomb]] in the desert of Arrakis. The late Duke's legacy was felt in Paul's reign as Emperor, and also in the conception of a daughter [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], carried by Jessica but only discovered after Leto's death.

===Legacy===
{{Quote|Much more remains of my father than these few freagments. His bloodline, his character, and his teachings have made me who I am. As long as the universe remembers me as [[Paul Atreides/XD | Paul-Muad'Dib]], so too will [[Duke]] Leto Atreides be remembered. The son is always shaped by the father.|Paul continues his father's legacy, inscription of the [[Harg Pass Shrine]]|Paul of Dune}}
In some ways, Leto lived on in his son Paul and grandson Leto II, through their possession of [[Other Memory]]. It was also partially Leto's love for Duncan Idaho that saw Leto II maintain a series of Idaho gholas throughout his reign. During both Paul's and Leto II's reign, millions flocked to visit Leto I's shrine, since Atreides ancestry had taken on a religious mystique. More than this however, Leto came to symbolise all that was good about the Atreides bloodline, namely courage, integrity, loyalty, justice, and honour. Because of this some have postulated that had Leto survived his rule of Arrakis, he would have eventually commanded the same fanaticism of the Fremen with which they came to follow his son Paul. Indeed, some have taken this argument further and postulated that his popularity with those he ruled, combined with his popularity in the Landsraad, may have seen him eventually ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Thus, the positive strength of character and many talents Leto was generally regarded to possess, and the possibilities of what might have been, illustrates the inherent tragedy of his story.

Hoh Vitt
{{expanded}}

[[File:Hohvitt.png|thumb]]

'''Hoh Vitt''' was a long-standing [[sergeant]] and soldier for [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] when [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]] guided the noble family. 

==Greeting Duncan Idaho==
It was Sergeant Vitt who greeted the newly initiated [[Swordsmaster/XD|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] when he returned from the training world of [[Ginaz/XD|Ginaz]]. The entire Atreides household was in turmoil and uproar, as Leto's first son, [[Victor Atreides]] had just been killed in a [[Skyclipper]] incident, and Hoh let Idaho pass to comfort the Duke. 

==Entombed in the Shield Wall==
Sixteen years later, after the Atreides family moved to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], Hoh's group of soldiers had been caught near the [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]] compound, during the attack by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]]. He had been ordered by [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] to guard the Atreides supplies in the [[Shield Wall/XD|Shield Wall]]. While returning artillery fire, the entire group of men and had been buried alive, and sealed in by an avalanche. Hoh's nephew, [[Elto Vitt]] had suffered massive injuries during the battle, although had not told him how extensive and severe his condition actually was. Elto was considered by the men of his platoon to be a novice, someone who had received favortism because of the battle-hardened Hoh. 

The men realized their eventual fate, that they were sealed in permanently; when they attempted to release [[distrans]] bats out of the their cave into the Arrakis sky to carry the message that they were entombed underground, but the bats could not make it out of the rock formation. When the doomed troops realized their fate, Elto begged his uncle to tell them all stories of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], most of th men's homeworld, in the ways of a [[Master Jongleur]], a master storyteller. 

==Listening to the Master Jongleur==
Hoh, who had been raised on [[Jongleur]], told the stories of the fisherman of Caladan, and each of the men, under Jongleur hypnosis, remembered the water-world in each their own fashion. [[Avram Fultz]], one of the soldiers, reminisced about eating a [[paradan melon]], fresh from the sea. [[Deegan]], another soldier, recollected seeing an [[elecran]] once, although was glad he never had contact with the fearsome monsters. Elto himself, remembered diving deep off the coast of the [[Southern Continent]] of Caladan.

Still entrapped within the avalanche of the Shield Wall, Hoh continued spinning his Master story, never letting up the hypnotic trance, allowing the young men to believe they were back of the Atreies home planet. Hoh eventually died, as did the rest of the men.

As the cave was excavated by [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] natives who realized that an entire troop of soldiers must lie in the buried cave, all of the men were found dead. But due to the storytelling of Hoh Vitt, each soldier was lined up with a joyous expression on their face, and each had died believing he had drowned on Caladan, doing the deed they were reminiscing about. Each of the soldiers lungs, including Hoh's, had sea water in them.

'''Elto Vitt''' was a [[soldier]] for [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] when [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]] and his household were ambushed on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]].

==Entombed in the Shield Wall==
Elto's group of soldiers had been on patrol around the Atreides compound in [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]] during the attack by House Harkonnen. [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney halleck]] had ordered the contingent of soldiers to guard the storehouses of Atreides food, ammunition, and water supplies that had been stored in the [[Shield Wall/XD|Shield Wall]]. The Harkonnen forces had attacked the Wall, collapsed the ceiling of rock, and had buried the troops alive, sealing them in with an avalanche. 

Elto has suffered massive injuries during the battle, although his uncle, [[Sergeant]] [[Hoh Vitt]], entrapped with him, had not told him how extensive and severe his condition actually was. Elto was considered by the men of his platoon to be a novice, someone who had received favortism because of his battle-hardened uncle. 

The men realized their eventual fate, that they were sealed in permanently; when they attempted to release [[distrans]] bats out of the their cave into the Arrakis sky to carry the message that they were entombed underground, but the bats could not make it out of the rock formation.

[[File:Deegan.png|thumb]]

'''Deegan''' was a soldier for [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] when [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]] and his household were ambushed on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] in [[10191 AG]]. 

==Entombed in the Shield Wall==

The Harkonnen forces had attacked the Wall, collapsed the ceiling of rock, and had buried the troops alive, sealing them in with an avalanche. 

Deegan was relatively unhurt during the melee', as others, such as [[Elto Vitt]] had suffered massive injuries during the battle. Elto was considered by the men of his platoon to be a novice, someone who had received favortism because of his battle-hardened uncle, [[Sergeant]] [[Hoh Vitt]].

{{Quote|Among [[Paul Atreides | Muad'Dib]]'s staunchest friends was Gurney Halleck - troubadour-warrior, smuggler, and planetary governor. Halleck's greatest joy was to play the [[baliset]] and sing songs. His heroic exploits provided his fellow troubadorss with material for many songs.|A Child's History of Muad'Dib by the [[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan]]|Paul of Dune}}

'''Gurney Halleck Ernson''' [b[[. 10145 AG]]], usually shortened to simply '''Gurney Halleck''', was [[Warmaster]] for [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] during the reign of [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], and then his son [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]]. Later, he was both the [[Earl]] of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] and [[Baron|Siridar-Baron]] of [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]], his birthplace from which he had escaped the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]].

Along with [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]] and [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], Halleck was one of Paul's principal teachers during his early years on [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. He was a ruthless, yet noble and romantic warrior of enormous talent. Described as ''"an ugly lump of a man"'', he was regarded the most loyal of friends to those he loved, and to those he hated there were few enemies more terrifying. A traditionalist and purist at heart, Gurney Halleck did not indulge in melange addiction or other methods to prolong human life.

Halleck was a talented minstrel who was skilled in the use of the [[baliset]]. He would often play music on this instrument to entertain his guests, or to fill the dining halls of House Atreides with music when he was in their service. Moreover, Halleck was also fond of sprouting verse from ancient epic tales, and would frequently find an appropriate verse for almost every situation. Indeed, at times his quotations were so appropriate they were almost prophetic.

Halleck's fighting abilities were second to none. In a fight against Gurney with  [[sword]] or [[knife]], few opponents lasted more than a few moments, including even battle-hardened [[Sardaukar]]. Gurney was also skilled at various other weapons, and astonished [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] later saw that he could adapt to his environment, as witnessed by the fact that he taught himself to ride sandworms as they did.

However, it was the way in which Halleck managed to fuse the minstrel and warrior that made him so unique. According to Idaho, ''"He could be killing you while he was singing and never miss a note."''

==History==
===Early life===
Halleck was raised on [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] under the rule of [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]].  In [[10166 AG]], when Gurney was 31, his sister [[Bheth|Bheth Halleck]] was taken by the Harkonnens. Four years after his sister was captured, when the treachery of Gurney's father [[Ernso]] was discovered, he began being used as slave labour to drive Harkonnen machinery. 

=== Escape from slavery ===
Three years into his slavery, Halleck challenged [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen/XD|Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]], who was the slave master at the time. As a result of this confrontation, Halleck's jawline bore a scar from an [[inkvine]] whip wound inflicted by Rabban. This scar would serve to remind Halleck of his origins, as it had left a permanent poison in his skin that would irritate him and cause him to rub the scar frequently, for the rest of his life. In addition to this scar, Rabban took Gurney, tied him down and forced him to watch as his sister Bheth was sexually assaulted by Rabban and his men, who then strangled her to death. 

After this incident, he escaped Giedi Prime by stowing away aboard a cargo ship that carried a load of blue obsidian bound for [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]]. He met up with the rogue [[House Vernius]], and eventually, after a string of conflicts and the death of Dominic Vernius, Gurney Halleck arrived on Caladan, seeking the exiled Prince [[Rhombur Vernius]]. After helping to reclaim the planet [[Ix/XD|Ix]] for House Vernius, Halleck returned to Caladan.

[[Image:Gurney Halleck.jpg|thumb]]

===Life with House Atreides===

Gurney found service with House Atreides under Duke Leto a year later. He eventually became [[Warmaster]] and a loyal friend to Leto and his concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]]. When Leto and Jessica had a son, Paul, Halleck later served as one of Paul's instructors in war and hand-to-hand combat.

Lady Jessica, who knew him so well, recalled in him an epigram written on the wall of a Muslim palace in the country of Spain, which once existed on [[Earth/XD|Old Earth]]. She called him ''Gurney The Valorous'' from that Islamic ode:

:''"There are four pillars which support the world...the wisdom of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave."''

===War of Assassins of 10,187 AG===
During the great conflict of the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]], Gurney Halleck was present during the failed assassination attempt of Duke Leto's life at his marriage ceremony to [[Ilesa Ecaz]], who sadly was killed. Halleck accompanied Duke Leto a few weeks later, when Leto dispatched [[Prad Vidal]] on the Elacca sub-continent on the Ecazi home-world.

When full blown war broke out between [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]] later that year, Gurney Halleck was on the Moritani homeworld of [[Grumman]], as a leader of the Ecazi/Atreides' forces. Halleck discovered that it was none other that Glossu Rabban who on Grumman as a secret leader of the disguised Harkonnen and Moritani forces. Rabban was pursued by Halleck and Atreides forces into the underbrush and hills surrounding Grumman's main city of [[Ritka]]. Before he could be captured by Halleck, he fell into a raging river, and was lost sight of in the rapids. Halleck and the Atreides forces returned to Caladan victorious.
===Life on Arrakis===

Four years later, like the entire Atreides staff, Halleck accompanied the Duke and his family to Arrakis. Unlike other Atreides lieutenants such as Duncan Idaho, Halleck survived the [[Siege of Arrakeen]] on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. In the weeks after the Siege, he fell in with [[Smuggler|spice smugglers]] led by [[Staban Tuek]], eventually becoming a powerful figure, both in their ranks and on Arrakis in general. Two years after the Siege, Halleck and his smugglers fell for a Fremen trap - a fake hoard of spice - and were almost killed before Paul, who had now become the Fremen leader [[Muad'Dib/XD|Muad'Dib]], recognized him among the smugglers. Upon returning to [[Sietch Tabr]] with Paul, Halleck almost killed the Lady Jessica, because he was under the mistaken impression (as others were) that she was responsible for the betrayal of House Atreides to House Harkonnen.

===Leader in the Jihad===
Few men, other than the Atreides, could have been more satisfied to see Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his House fall, especially at the hands of the Atreides, whom Halleck so deeply loved. After Paul ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne]], Halleck at first became responsible for training the Fremen for their role as [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Jihadi]] soldiers.

One such training time came as Halleck prepared the Arrakan natives to fight off-world on water-oriented planets a year into Paul's reign. Gurney threw a [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino]] [[solari]] to the bottom of a tank of water, and then encouraged the Fremen faithful to retrieve the coin in the 8 foot deep pool. One such bright student, [[Enno]], desired to show himself especially faithful to [[Muad'Dib]]; and swam and brought the metallic object to the surface. Much to Halleck's dismay, Enno almost died, as he consumed large quantities of water into his lungs. It was then at this time that Gurney realized the fanaticism of the Fremen for Paul.

Two years later, as the Jihad armies brought the planet [[Galicia]] under the domain of Paul, Gurney was deeply troubled by the viciousness of the attack on the villa of that planet's [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] representative [[Lord]] [[Colus]]. The Fremen soldiers burned the entire village that surrounded the villa to ruins; and Enno, who thought himself fervent in the service of Muad'Dib, threatened Colus even as the nobleman surrendered to Halleck. Later, when Halleck inspected the battle damage, he saw that Enno had severed Colus's head, and placed it on a spike. To restore discipline, Halleck slit Enno's throat, and placed ''his'' head on the spike, as a reminder that basic rules of war must be obeyed.

===Baron of Giedi Prime===
In [[10197 AG]], a year after killing Enno, Halleck returned from the Jihad to Arrakeen, when Paul immediately rewarded him with the [[fief]] of Giedi Prime, and made him the [[Baron]] of the planet. When Halleck arrived on the planet, he visited the village of his youth, [[Dmitri]], when so much anguish took place in his life. Halleck remembered the so-called [[pleasure house]]s, where his sister, [[Bheth Halleck]], had been a constantly raped sex slave. As a final act of revenge against the Harkonnens, Gurney visited the pleasure house of [[Rulien Scheck]], where Bheth was used and taken, and had Scheck put to death. Then promptly, Halleck overturned all of the slavocracy that existed, and outlawed the practice.

But Giedi Prime was not where Halleck wanted to be, as the planet brought back too many bad memories. When the Lady Jessica visited Paul on Arrakis, Halleck happened to return on the same [[heighliner/XD|heighliner]], and Paul relieved him of his Giedi Prime duties. Paul instructed Gurney to become the [[Duchess]] Jessica's principal officer, and returned to Caladan with her in 10198.

===Earl on Caladan===
In [[10200 AG]], as the Jihad spread throughout the Imperium, the [[Qizarate]] of Muad'Dib wanted to rename Caladan a name honoring Paul's youth. Aided secretly by the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam, the water world declared itself independent of Paul's Empire. Gurney, who had been made an [[Earl]] of the water-oriented world, tried negotiating with the secessionsit leaders, again and again, to show them the error of their ways, but it was to no avail.

When the [[Duchess]] Jessica returned to Caladan returned from a visit with Paul and [[Bronso Vernius]] of Ix, she was alarmed at the rebel situation in [[Cala City]] as it was spreading throughout the [[Western Continent]]. She asked Gurney to summon ten of the secessionist leaders to [[Castle Caladan]] for an all night negotiation on the future of Caladan. While there, Jessica dismissed Gurney, and poisoned each of the ten leaders to death; knowing it was for the good of the Imperium.

===Friend of Jessica===
It was said that during this time, when Paul was Emperor, Gurney Halleck became the lover of the Lady Jessica, though the two of them kept their relationship out of the public eye to avoid scandal. It would appear that Halleck spent the remainder of his days assisting the Lady Jessica in ruling Caladan.

Halleck still retained the title of Baron of Giedi Prime, and as well as outlawing slavery on the world, he ecologically improved the entire infrastructure on the planet, with the help of the Caladani people. Included in this massive project was the reseeding of natural flora and fauna, as well as the renaming of places and cities.

=== After Paul's Death ===
{{Stub}}
In [[10219 AG]], Halleck was sent by Jessica to infiltrate [[Sietch Jacurutu|Jacurutu]], where her grandson, [[Leto Atreides II]], was captured. On Gurney's suggestion, Leto was forced to undergo the spice trance. 

===Attempted Ghola During Kralizec===
After the time of the [[Ascension of House Atreides]], the reign of the [[God-Emperor]], and [[Scattering/XD|The Scattering]], the end of the age and the coming of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]] began. Duncan Idaho and [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]], with various crew and captives, escaped in the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]'', from the united [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]]/[[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] capital of [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]]. They were subsequently pursued by the Outside [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]] who tried to ensnare them in their [[tachyon net/XD|Tachyon net]], but the ''Ithaca'' escaped by folding space.

As the ''Ithaca'' began its' journey from one part of the Universe to another, it was revealed that one member aboard the ship, [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]], a [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]], had cells of Halleck and other leaders from mankind's history, that he kept in a [[nullentropy tube]]. The Bene Gesserit Sheeana, her [[sister]]s and acolytes, specifically chose to create a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] of Halleck and others in an [[Axlotl Tank|axlotl tank]], as Sheeana suspected Halleck's fighting skills would be a great asset.

Unbeknownst to them, the Jewish [[Rabbi/XD|Rabbi]] aboard the ''Ithaca'', was really an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]. As he pretended to pray with [[Rebecca/XD|Rebecca]], who had volunteered to be an axlotl tank, the Rabbi killed the unborn ghola of Halleck and two others. No more attempts were made to create a ghola of Halleck, before the no-ship was captured by the Enemy.

==Other Versions==

According to the [[The Dune Encyclopedia|''Dune Encyclopedia'']], Gurney was originally a native of Chusuk who had come into Harkonnen slavery through one of [[Glossu Rabban|Glossu Rabban']]s raids on that world. Also in this version, his sister was called Annette instead of Bheth and she was murdered by a Harkonnen officer on her first day at the Harkonnen pleasure-house, spared a life of brutalization. 

==Behind the Scenes ==
In David Lynch's film version of Dune, he was portrayed by Patrick Stewart, while in the Sci Fi Channel mini-series, the role was played by P. H. Moriarty.

</gallery>}}'''Dr. Wellington Yueh''' ([[10082 AG]] - [[10191 AG]]) was a [[Suk]] doctor and agent of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] who served [[House Atreides]] as the personal physician of [[Leto Atreides I]]. He was a straight stick figure of a man with a squarish block of a head and black hair, which he wore long and caught in a Suk School silver ring at his left shoulder. He had a sallow complexion, up-angled cheeks, almond-shaped eyes like dark sequins, and a drooping mustache that hung like a curved frame around his purple lips and narrow chin. His forehead was tattooed with the black diamond of Imperial Conditioning.

== Biography ==
Yueh graduated from the [[Suk School]] in [[10,112 AG|10112 AG]] and married [[Wanna Marcus]]. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron's [[Twisted mentat]] [[Piter de Vries]] found a workaround.

In the [[10180s AG]], the Baron took Wanna prisoner, threatening her with torture and death unless Yueh complied with his demands. The Harkonnens also distracted Leto's Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] from discovering Yueh by guiding Hawat toward another suspect: Leto's [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] Lady [[Jessica Atreides]]. With Jessica herself eliminating suspects though her Bene Gesserit skills of observation and [[Truthsayer|Truthsaying]], Hawat notes that testing Yueh in this way would be an empty gesture since he's conditioned by the [[High College]]. Jessica also notes her knowledge that Wanna was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens, hearing his hate when speaking about them.

The Atreides are soon attacked by Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial [[Sardaukar]]) as Yueh follows orders and disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis. Yueh stabbed the Duke with a poison dart, and while he was paralysed he replaced one of the Duke's teeth with a false one that could expel poisonous gas. The idea was that the Duke would have an opportunity to kill the Baron, using the poisoned gas tooth. Unfortunately, the plan failed when the Duke, in a state of delirium, mistook de Vries for the Baron and targeted him; the Baron narrowly escaped, and both the Duke and de Vries died.

Yueh discovers that Wanna is indeed dead moments before de Vries kills him, and Leto's assassination attempt of the Baron only kills Leto and DeVries. Leto and Jessica's son [[Paul Atreides]] flees into the desert with Jessica, aided by survival kits left for them by Yueh. Both are presumed dead, but are of course alive and living among the planet's native [[Fremen]].

Yueh died by the hand of de Vries, stabbed in the back by the twisted Mentat who had come to the logical conclusion that the traitor had outlived his usefulness. He died with the knowledge that his wife had in fact been dead for years, slain by the Harkonnens and kept a secret, so that he could do their bidding.

==Behind the Scenes==
Most adaptions fall short in explaining how exactly de Vries managed to break Yueh's imperial conditioning and simply rely on him being blackmailed by the Harkonnens, however the very point of imperial conditioning was to make such manipulation by blackmail, bribery or pressure all but impossible. Even in the book itself it is indicated that de Vries or at least the Baron themselves were not fully aware on how they had managed to overwrite Yueh's conditioning. de Vries seems to have created a necessity for Baron Harkonnen's death in Yueh's mind, however as Yueh's own conditioning prevented him from doing so by himself, DeVries' counter-conditioning pressed Yueh into a situation in which the death of Baron Harkonnen by the hands of another needed to be arranged -this other however could be none else but Duke Leto. In a way in this counter-conditioning the treason on Leto was just a by-product and the necessity of Leto's death to bring forth Baron Harkonnen's death, enabling Yueh to overcome his original conditioning and commit treason. de Vries had used the Baron himself as means to transmit Yueh's conditioning against killing into a conditioning of the need to arrange the circumstances of a target's certain death - a fact de Vries never had openly revealed to his master.

[[The Dune Encyclopedia]] also addresses the problem and mentions a number of in-world explanations for example the theory that Yueh was indeed a fake-Suk and in truth a trained and conditioned [[Assassin]], or that Yueh's Wife Wanna had conditioned her husband to protect her life so Yueh's mind was fighting with two contradicting conditionings of which the Bene Gesserit proved to be the stronger one. A third theory finally comes to the conclusion that the Suk-conditioning was in fact in its core flawed to begin with and relied much more on self-deception and its own myth than reality.

Yueh was played by [[Dean Stockwell]] in [[David Lynch]]'s 1984 film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''. [[Robert Russell (actor)|Robert Russell]] portrayed the character in the 2000 [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries]]. [[Chang Chen]] portrays Yueh in the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 Dune film]].

After falling in the [[Desert War]] on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]<ref name=":0">[[Dune]]</ref>, he grew in importance from this relatively obscure role through a series of [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]] [[Ghola/XD|ghola]] incarnations over the next five thousand years, first playing a key role as a Mentat in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|the final plot]] against [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides]]<ref name=":1">[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]</ref>, then becoming the husband of the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]]<ref name=":2">[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]</ref>, which was followed by his time as the [[Commander]] of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]]'s forces<ref name=":3">[[God Emperor of Dune]]</ref>, and finally as an important figure in [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|the war]] between the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] and [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]].<ref name=":4">[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]</ref>

{{Quote|Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldeir. Atreides field-hand on the field of battle.|[[Bijaz]] describing ther original Duncan to [[Hayt]]|Dune Messiah}}

====Early life on Giedi Prime====

[[File:Duncanidahoyoung.png|thumb|a young Duncan Idaho, by Dev Pramanik and Alex Guimarães, House Atreides Graphic novel ]]

Idaho was born on [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] in [[10146 AG]]. His parents were minor government office workers<ref name=":5">[[Dune: House Atreides]]</ref> descended from [[Anari Idaho]], who had been the ancient leader of the great [[Butlerian movement]] ten thousand years ago<ref>[[Navigators of Dune]]</ref>, but at an early age he and his family felt the wrath of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]]: his family, parents, uncle and two cousins were captured in an afternoon in [[Harko]] City, and his sister was killed. Idaho was named '''Number 11368''', and trained to be hunted for sport.

One time, Idaho managed to escape his captors. He entered a [[sunspensor tube]] where the guards could not use [[lasgun]]s. When he saw a [[bullet-train]] approaching, he managed to fall in a hatch. There he was trapped, however the guards who found him later, told him that he "made it".

Duncan's family was visited by [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]] to be congratulated for his ingenuity and be taken for a second round with Rabban, who recently disappointed by a [[sandworm]] hunt on [[Arrakis]]. When he called the boy as "Number 11368", Duncan defiantly mentioned his true name; Rabban shot both his parents with a lasgun and his men forced Duncan outside.

The next time he was left outside in the [[Forest Guard Station|open]], armed only with a handlight, a rope and a [[knife]]. Duncan decided to use the knife and remove the tracer implanted on his shoulder. Using it as a bait, it lured one of the hunters in a rock opening, and then Duncan crushed him by pushing a boulder above him. Then, after cutting his throat he took a [[medpak]] and his lasgun.

With the medpak he managed to fix his shoulder wound, and then had some practice with the lasgun. He managed to drive away a [[gaze hound]] that attacked him. Using the handlight in the snow, he lured his trackers and shot some of them in a lasgun fray. With its charge running low, Duncan started to run towards a blinking light, which turned out to be a [[flitter]]. He entered it, only to be caught by [[Janess Milam]], the woman who gave his family to the Harkonnens.

====Atreides Service====

=====In the Service of Duke Paulus=====
Having to repent, she planned to send Duncan to the Atreides; she arranged with [[Renno]] the Second mate of a cargo craft that Idaho could board the ship and escape the planet. He found his way to [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] and he was determined to find [[Duke]] Atreides.

He started to work as a farm worker in the rice paddies and then as a net-rigger on a fishing boat from the [[Southern Continent]]. As they reached a port on the [[Western Continent]]. He began hitching rides on groundtrucks and cars, and sneaked aboard tube trains and cargo ornithopters until he drove close to [[Castle Caladan]]. In conversations with other travelers, he was shocked to realize that the people there loved and respected their ruler instead of fearing him, much unlike the situation on Giedi Prime.

Eventually (after denied entrance and spending a night in the courtyard), he was allowed audition to the Duke. He narrated his full story and pledged his loyalty to the service of House Atreides.

Initially he worked in the stables under Stablemaster [[Yresk]]. After exposing the successful assassination plot of Lady [[Helena Atreides]] against the beloved Duke [[Paulus Atreides]].<ref name=":5" /> 
=====Training and Loyalty=====
Duncan came under the service of the Atreides after observing that they ruled in stark contrast to the Harkonnens.<ref name=":0" /> In 10166, ten years after coming into their service, he began his training on [[Ginaz]] where he graduated as a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] in 10174, coinciding with the Moritani attack on the school in which the students of Grumman fought the others and were ultimately expelled after refusing to condemmn the Viscount Hundro Moritani's actions. Duncan tried to convince his friend Hiih Resser to come and serve the Atreides, but Resser unfortunately joined Moritani as his personal Swordmaster.<ref>[[Dune: House Harkonnen]]</ref>

The Atreides appeared to garner fierce loyalty from those who served them, and Duncan was no different. However, as the Atreides Swordmaster he maintained a hypervigilance against potential threats to the Atreides, even within their own ranks. As a result, he developed a distrust of the Lady [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica]], as he knew that her [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] origins were likely to involve some secret scheme against the Atreides. However, Duncan underestimated Jessica's love for her Duke, which was so strong that she disobeyed her Sisterhood. Indeed, in matters regarding the Lady Jessica, Duncan's judgment was somewhat clouded, since he was secretly in love with her.

Duncan was charged by Duke Leto with training his son Paul (and possibly the Duke's armies) in the art of war. This involved hand-to-hand combat and military strategy. These skills Duncan imparted on the young Paul in conjunction with [[Thufir Hawat]] and [[Gurney Halleck]], a man who was also been rescued from Giedi Prime by the Old Duke Paulus. When compared to Gurney, Duncan appeared to fight with more finesse but Gurney was regarded as more lethal, typically beating Duncan six times out of ten. This seemed to give Paul a well-rounded education.<ref name=":0" />

=====War of Assassins of 10,187=====
<blockquote>''Main article: [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]]''</blockquote>During the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG|final War of Assassins]] between [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]], the Atreides family became involved as collateral damage when [[Ilesa Ecaz]], the intended bride of Duke Leto, was killed just before marrying him. The entire planet went on lockdown, and Paul was left to Idaho's care in [[Castle Caladan]]. After Duke Leto left with an attack force to meet the Moritani's on their home planet of [[Grumman]], Paul was attacked shortly thereafter in his bedchamber.

He and Duncan had to flee into the night, where they arranged through ornithopter flight to escape and travel to Caladan's sparsely populated [[Eastern Continent]]. While fleeing, Paul and Duncan were ruthlessly hunted throughout all of the continent's dense forest overgrowth. The two eventually made friends with the [[Caladan primitive]]s, who helped them escape from the assassins over the course of the following week.

{{Quote|I have no room for compassion toward people who are trying to slaughter us, Paul. I kill them so ''you'' don't have to.|Duncan to [[Paul Atreides]]|Paul of Dune}} 
After two more nights in the jungle, Duncan arranged for he and Paul to gain entry to the abbey of the [[Sisters in Isolation]], home in exile of Paul's grandmother, [[Lady]] [[Helena Atreides]]. The two rested and refreshed themselves, as Idaho re-met the cold-hearted woman who had killed Idaho's beloved Duke Paulus. After the Moritani assassins found Idaho and Atreides they bombarded and burned down the entire abbey, killing almost everyone inside, including Paul's grandmother. [[Swain Goire]], the Lady's bodyguard, was present, as he had joined Helena years later as his punishment for his crime against [[Victor Atreides]], Leto's first son. He fought the Moritani assassins single-handedly, and gave his life, in a last ditch effort to allow Duncan and Paul to escape. Later, in the deep jungle, the Caladan primitives set traps for the assassins, and killed the Moritani murderers, as they came to understand the kindness of the Atreides' family, and their just rule over the planet.
======Attack on Grumman ======
When the time arrived for House Atreides to converge with House Ecaz at [[Grumman]]; Duncan, of course, went along. As House Atreides attacked the Grumman forces, with Ecazi re-inforcements, it seemed evident that [[Ritka]], capital of Grumman would soon fall to Leto's and Armand's forces. As a way of acting as "the peacemaker", the Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] himself, arrived with [[Sardaukar]] in tow, to end the War, and to enforce the cease-fire.

[[Hundro Moritani]] announced that he had all of the great pawns in the place where he wanted them. Leto, Armand, Shaddam, and even secretly, Rabban was there, fighting for an incognito House Harkonnen. Hundro announced that House Moritani was descended from disgraced [[House Tantor]], whom had blown up [[Salusa Secundus]] almost 10,000 years earlier. He then told the entire delegation that he was going to kill himself, and all nobles and armies present, with the [[atomics]] stockpiled by his House. However, the Viscount's bodyguard, Hiih Resser, a friend of Duncan's from the Ginaz Aacademy, had decided to disobey Hundro, and had never set the charges to the detonators on the nuclear devices.<ref>[[Paul of Dune]]</ref>

=====Move to Arrakis=====
Later, when the Atreides gained the [[Arrakis]] fief under the order of the [[Emperor]] in 10191, Idaho became Duke Leto's ambassador to the [[Fremen]], the people native to Dune that Leto hoped would ally with him in the feud against [[House Harkonnen]]. Idaho was so impressed with the Fremen, that he took dual allegiances, one to the Atreides, one to the Fremen.
=====Death=====
When the Emperor launched [[Siege of Arrakeen|an attack]] on [[Arrakeen]] in the guise of Harkonnen troops, Idaho escaped the massacre. He initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes, Lady Jessica and Paul, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar. Duncan was killed by one by by a blow to the head, but not before he dispatched no less than nineteen Sardaukar soldiers single-handedly. In so doing, he rescued the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]], who later became the first Emperor in the dynasty of House Atreides, and Duke Leto's concubine, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], allowing them to escape in an ornithopter.<ref name=":0" />
===First rebirth {{C|10193-10217}}===
After Paul's ascension to the throne in 10193, Idaho was returned to life as a [[ghola]]''',''' a clone made by the [[Tlulaxa|Bene Tleilax]] and gifted to Paul Atreides, which was supposed to tempt the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]] into becoming that which he despised. Known as '''Hayt''' in this first ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a [[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] and a [[Zensunni]] philosopher. He had no memory of his former life, but constantly felt vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that made him hope he could recover those memories (this had never previously been possible with gholas).

Failing to destroy the Emperor psychically, Hayt was programmed to kill Paul against his will. In ensuing the trauma imposed by his inability to reconcile his programming and his innate love for the Atreides, Hayt recovered his memories as Duncan Idaho, up to and including his death at the hands of Imperial [[Sardaukar]]. He stopped the attempt on Paul's life, and became once more a loyal Atreides servant. This became the crux of a Bene Tleilax plot to overthrow Paul by demonstrating that they could create an exact equivalent of his dead wife Chani, but only if he abdicated his throne.<ref name=":1" />

====After Paul's "Death"====
Immediately after Paul's "death" and disappearance of him "walking into the desert", Idaho became concerned for Paul's sister, Alia, and her assumption of Imperial Regent to Paul's children, Leto and Ghanima. Duncan secretly welcomed the Lady Jessica and her aide, Gurney Halleck, back to Arrakis, as they too expressed concern about Alia's paranoia against foes, real and imagined.

Even as Alia created the super-religious, fanatical [[Mahdinate]], to deify the Atreides family, he found himself increasingly attracted to her. Idaho ignored her suppression of all forms of dissent and her execution of Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso Vernius]] of Ix.<ref>[[The Winds of Dune]]</ref>

====Second death ====
[[Image:8969-5459.gif|thumb|right|Richard Jordan, as Duncan, from the [[Dune (1984 movie)]]]]
Idaho married [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia]], Paul's sister and Imperial regent to Paul's children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], in 10210. However, Alia became possessed by the memory-ego of her ancestor, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], who sought to destroy the Atreides empire. Recognizing this, Idaho remained loyal to the Atreides and escaped to the desert to protect the children. In 10219, in order to get Stilgar to join the Fremen opposition to Alia's rule, Duncan killed Javid, Alia's secret lover, on the neutral ground of Sietch Tabr, then insulted the [[naib]] [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] so deeply that he was forced to kill Idaho. Ducan's second death, as Duncan knew it would, brought the Fremen into direct opposition to Alia.<ref name=":2" />

===Incarnations under Leto II {{C|10217-13725}}===
Idaho then reappeared as a series of gholas when Leto II ruled as a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid for 3,508 years. After the death of every ghola, Leto would have him replaced with a new one. Thus, Leto continually had an Idaho ghola to serve him as Swordmaster at all times, and as leader of the [[Fish Speakers]]. To Leto, Idaho represented loyalty, humanity and the spirit of the unknown, something which the God-Emperor, having perfect prescience and memories of all his ancestors, knew nothing of (Leto also implied that Duncan was needed for the [[Golden Path]] to come to fruition). The ego-memories of Leto I and Paul within Leto II loved Duncan, which was another reason why the [[God Emperor]] enjoyed Duncan's presence.

The Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, fought to deal with what the Atreides had become in Leto II, which Duncan saw as a corruption. Prior to Leto II's rule, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice. However, Duncan believed that Leto II's reign was one of religious tyranny and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience would rebel, leading some of the Idaho gholas to attempt to kill Leto (who was invulnerable to all but water and the ''extreme'' violence of a sandworm).

Leto noted that only nineteen of "his" Duncans had survived long enough to die of what was considered "natural causes". In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola was killed by the God Emperor himself<ref name=":3" />, and in at least one instance he died under the knife of a Fish Speaker assassin - in another, he died under a Sardaukar sword, when Leto still used them as his fighting force. In one anomalous occasion, Idaho died in a 'thopter crash.<ref name=":6">[[Heretics of Dune]]</ref> In another even rarer occasion, Duncan had accidentally blew himself up after an attempt on Leto's life which he abandoned when the Emperor convinced him he was doing the wrong, causing him to toss the explosive, in which the materials were unstable, to the side.

After a brief period of mourning, the God Emperor would order another Idaho ghola from the [[Tleilaxu]]. The man usually showed up believing he had gone insane, in shock at how the Universe had changed since his "death" since most Duncans only possessed the memories of the original Idaho. If the new ghola survived Leto II's first interviews, he would serve the God Emperor until his almost inevitable rebellion.<ref name=":3" />

====Suppression of Wallach IX====
In 13650, Duncan was charged by Leto to travel to Wallach IX, where he would extinguish the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on the planet in order to enforce Leto's ban of the ancient Order of Mentats. This brought him great pain, as he, a Mentat, was forced to suppress a school that trained people the way he was trained. During the suppression, he talked to Sister Tersius Helen Anteac, one of the Mentat trainees<ref name=":4" /> who escaped the planet shortly after, renaming herself Tertius Eileen Anteac, under the name of which she would later try and kill the God Emperor. Other Mentat-Sisters escaped as well, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood. This incarnation of Duncan died just ten years after the suppression.

====Penultimate Incarnation under Leto====
In his penultimate incarnation still serving the God Emperor, the one after his life in which he suppressed Wallach IX, Duncan had two children with the Fish Speaker [[Irti]] in [[Sietch Jacurutu|Goygoa]]; one in 13712, and another in 13720. In 13727 he made his last unsuccessful attempt on Leto's life after fifty-eight years of service, in which he attempted to kill him with a lasgun supplied to him by the Ixian Ambassador Iyo Kobat. This failed when Leto attacked and killed him.

====Last Incarnation in Leto's Service====
After this last time in which he was killed by the God Emperor, a new Duncan was given to Leto by the Bene Tleilax in 13728. This Duncan fell in love with Siona Atreides, a girl hidden from prescience who rebelled against Leto, and became good friends with Siona's father and Leto's majordomo, Moneo Atreides, despite him easily beating him in combat and thus shaming him later on. Ultimately, Duncan joined a final attempt on Leto's life with Siona and her assistant and co-conspirator Nayla. During the God Emperor's wedding with his love, the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree, Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by Nayla. Leto, Hwi and Moneo fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]], named after Duncan In dying, the God Emperor released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise.

=====After Leto's Death=====
After the assassination, Duncan had nine daughters and a thousand sons with Siona<ref name=":3" /> - these children and these children's children, and so on, were hidden from prescience. The significant descendants of these many children, which were said to have "Siona blood", meaning they were shrouded from the prescient vision, included [[Hadi Benotto]], [[Darwi Odrade]], [[Miles Teg]] and [[Sheeana Brugh]]. Duncan and Siona also inherited a portion of Leto's empire, which rapidly detoriorated into the [[Famine Times]] and the [[Scattering]].

Ultimately, long after the death of this incarnation, the [[Bene Gesserit]] became the consumers of Idaho gholas. However, the Bene Tleilax kept killing the gholas after only a few years. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho would serve, the Bene Gesserit suspected that the Tleilaxu were using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose in addition to their own. However, the twelfth ghola, born in 15216, survived.

===Final incarnation {{C|15216-15264}}===

====On Gammu====
In 15229, on Gammu (formerly Giedi Prime), Duncan fled to an old Harkonnen no-globe with Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit [[Bashar/XD|Bashar]], and Reverend Mother Lucilla, after an attack on the Bene Gesserit Gammu Keep. Miles Teg was commissioned to restore Duncan's memories, and managed to do so. Duncan, Teg and Lucilla were ambushed during an operation with the general Burzmali. Teg was captured but Duncan managed to escape with Lucilla.

When [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]], a captured [[Honored Matre]], tried to bond with Duncan, the Tleilaxu plan came into play when he overwhelmed Murbella in combat, and all of the memories of the hundreds of previous Duncan Idaho gholas were released.

Duncan and Lucilla were located by Miles Teg and brough to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella in a no-ship. Duncan, Murbella, Lucilla, Sheeana Brugh, Darwi Odrade and Tleilaxu Master Scytale were put in the no-ship with a sandworm while Teg launched [[Battle of Rakis|a final suicidal defense of Rakis]].<ref name=":6" />

====Imprisoned on Chapterhouse====
After the destruction of Rakis, the no-ship ''Ithaca'' was brough to Chapterhouse in a no-ship, which became their prison, as well as Scytale's, by the Bene Gesserit. Over the next ten years, Murbella and Idaho sired four daughters, [[Janess Idaho]], [[Rinya Idaho]], [[Gianne Idaho]] and [[Tanisia Idaho]].. Idaho was then used to tutor and condition a young Miles Teg ghola. By this time, he had been allied with Reverend Mother [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] for some time, who stole the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Over the decade he spent imprisoned within the no-ship, he had continous visions of a pair of mysterious and powerful elderly-looking entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] and something he began to call "the net". He was suspicious of these beings but could never truly work out who they were.

====Escape from Chapterhouse ====
In 15240, after Murbella became both Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit and Great Honoured Matre of the Honoured Matres, and began the combination of the two groups, Duncan escaped with his ward, [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] and others aboard the no-ship ''Ithaca'' into unchartered space to escape from the now-combined Gesserit/Matres group, the [[New Sisterhood]]. Exhibiting [[prescience]] abilities, Idaho was the only person that could see the net that Daniel and Marty cast to ensare the no-ship. To escape this net, Duncan Idaho deleted all of the navigation records of the ''Ithaca'', rendering those onboard truly lost.<ref name=":4" /> 

====Alternate universe and Gholas====
After escaping from the tachyon net of the mysterious pair, and entering another universe in 15243, Duncan Idaho continued to be the captain of the ''Ithaca''. He was especially interested in the training of his friend, the ghola of Miles Teg in the arts of the [[Ginaz Swordmasters]]. After being in the alternate universe for 4 years, Idaho was contacted by the [[Oracle of Time]] - the guide of the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]] - and with her help, was able to make a blind [[foldspace]] jump, this time emerging back in the familiar universe.

It was during this time that Sheeana and the other Bene Gesserit [[sisters]] that she had brought along, decided to create gholas from the [[nullentropy tube]] that [[Scytale]], the [[Tleilaxu Master]], had brought with him. Gholas from Idaho's past; [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]], [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], [[Leto Atreides/XD|Leto II]], [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], Stilgar, [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], and [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Wellington Yueh]], were resurrected in a short period of time over the next few years.

====[[Rikka's Planet]]====
After another ten years had passed, bones of dead Reverend Mothers were found in a previously unexplored room of the no-ship. As the funeral ceremony for the Mothers commenced, Idaho once again saw the threads of the tachyon net once again thrown out by the Enemy. Both Teg and Idaho raced to the bridge of the ''Ithaca'', and as Teg reached first, he was able to activate the Holtzman engines to escape.

The ship came out of fold-space again at a planet that had been heavily colonized by human-kind during [[The Scattering]]. All of the buildings on the planet were covered with ivy, and been over-grown with plant life. Once again, Duncan stayed on the ship as a crew went to investigate further. Sheeana and Garimi, leading the investigation, activated a holo recording of an Honored Matre leader named [[Rikka]], who had contacted a dreaded plague. Rikka explained to those who watched that the plague came from those "with many faces". It was then that Sheeana realized that the planet had been devastated with a plague similar to the [[Omnius Scourge]], and all human-kind on the planet had died. The group immediately went back to the vessel.

====Planet of the Handlers====
Sabotage began aboard the ship, as someone released water into space, which showed where the no-ship was. Duncan feared the return of the elderly couple, called the crew back onto the ship, and encouraged the ghola of Miles Teg to engage the engines, which he did, folding space again. The ship came out of fold-space above the planet of the [[Handler/XD|Handlers]], keepers of the genetically-engineered half-man, half-feline [[Futar]]s. After some of the ''Ithaca'' crew, and [[Hrrm/XD|Hrrm]] and his clan of futars bounded down to the planet, they met the leader of the Handlers, [[Orak Tho]].

He divided the group into two, led them to observation towers, and together they watched a Futar-hunt of five Honored Matres. As Hrrm and his group killed some of the Matres, the last Matres remaining killed a Handler, who reverted to an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]. It soon became apparent to all that most of the Handlers were nothing more than [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s.

The watching crew, having been split into 2 separate groups, raced back to the ''Ithaca'', the first group led by Sheeana made it back quickly. The second, led by Hawat, had to make a death-defying jump onto the ship, as the ship pulled away from the planet's atmosphere. The Handlers tried to ram and board the ship, but were unsuccessful, as the ship folded space and disappeared again.<ref>[[Hunters of Dune]]</ref>

====Later years on the ''Ithaca''====
In his personal life, Duncan strongly wished to be free of the imprinting that Murbella had put upon him decades earlier. Still full of youth from the melange from the ship's storage, Sheeana broke Duncan free from the strong [[imprint]]-bond that Murbella had laid upon him. Idaho reflected upon his life, and the previous lives he had led, and realized that he truly felt sorry for all types of people, as he had accumulated lifetimes of memories to build up compassion for human-kind.

Over the next few years, the ''Ithaca'' was very careful in their travels, but the incidents of sabotage increased aboard the ship. Even though a ghola of [[Alia Atreides]] was birthed, someone killed the gholas of [[Xavier Harkonnen]], [[Serena Butler]], and [[Gurney Halleck]], that Sheeana had decided to raise in their war, if needed, against the Enemy. Yueh, being tricked by the Jewish Rabbi, purposely killed a ghola of Leto I, being raised in the ships [[Axlotl Tanks]]. Tensions increased as air recycling systems and food storage units were ruined and destroyed on the vessel by the unknown saboteur(s). This increased Duncan's feelings of helplessness and loneliness, as the ship, what he now felt was his ship, forced into another random jump, to find a way to replenish supplies.

====Qelso====
Idaho was surprised, as were all aboard, as the ''Ithaca'' came out of fold-space above the fruitful, but dying planet of Qelso, and he began to wonder if he had prescience in the choosing of fold-space timing and direction. Qelso was a seed world that [[Mother Superior]] Odrade had sent sisters to, and had been seeded with sand-trout to begin a [[spice cycle]]. The inhabitants were openly hostile to the Bene Gesserit for this reason, and held hostage some of the crew that went down to the planet.&nbsp; Duncan, who stayed invisible to the Enemy as long as he was on the ship, decided to lead a rescue team of the group.

The group, which consisted of Sheeana, Teg, and notable others was released; but Stilgar and Kynes stayed behind to help the bitter natives adapt to the encroaching desert and the ever increasing number of sandworms on the world. Idaho had made himself vulnerable to the watchful eyes of Daniel and Marty, and the ''Ithaca'' had to fold space again to safety.

==== Final Sabotage and Capture====
Later, when Leto II went to commune with the sandworms that were in the hold of the ship, Hawat went to guard him should the giant beasts turn on the young man. The worms reared up when Hawat entered the hold, and immediately killed Hawat, and showed him to be an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]. This led to a ship wide search for other saboteurs that might be involved in subversion. To question everyone aboard at the same time, all of the inhabitants of the ''Ithaca'' were called to the main assembly hall.

Scytale used the old Tleilaxu [[Whistling language]], which caused all [[Face Dancer]]s muscles and visages to momentarily become jumbled. It was revealed that the Rabbi was indeed an [[Enhanced Face Dancer]], and the Dancer stole away to the vessel's bridge, and locked himself in. The Dancer immediately began to destroy the ship's navigation, cloaking, and engine systems; and the ship returned to visibility. Idaho remembered back, and realized the Dancers must have boarded years earlier, at the planet of the Handlers.

Immediately the tachyon net reappeared, and Thinking Machine starships began to surround the no-ship. Alia managed to sneak into the cockpit of the ''Ithaca'', killing the Dancer, and opened the area. Idaho and Teg raced into the control room, Teg then went into hyper-movement, and raced around the ship at sonic speed, and repaired all of the ship's systems. As Duncan engaged the Holtzman Engines, a Machine starship rammed the ''Ithaca'', and forced it into submission. Idaho signaled surrender, and the ship was brought to the Machine Capital of [[Synchrony]], as the inhabitants of the no-ship realized that their Enemy were Thinking Machines.

====Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach on the Day of Kralizec====
As the Day of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]] began in the year [[15264 AG]], Omnius thought that Paul Atreides was the final super-being; Paul and his immediate family and friends, sans Duncan, were brought to the heart of the capital, in the [[Cathedral]]. There, Paul and a clone of him, [[Paolo]], dueled to the death; with Paolo rendered into an irreversible [[Ultraspice]] coma, and Paul had to heal himself from Paolo's near-fatal stab wound. As Duncan decided to enter the Cathedral, Paul came back from the brink of death. Both Paul's recently restored power of prescience and the [[Oracle of Time]] revealed that Duncan was the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach!&nbsp; Only Idaho had a multitude of a lifetime of experiences to refine his persona and abilities; not Paul, nor any other Atreides, nor any of their descendants.

The Oracle realized her life mission was to banish Omnius forever, and took Omnius with her to the alternate universe permanently, ending his rule as the [[Evermind]]. As a test of Duncan's powers, Erasmus ordered his killing robots to attack Idaho. Duncan used super-human speed to kill them, easily destroyed the units, and confirmed his future role as the final super-being. Overwhelmed by the unexpected revelations, Duncan decided to take Erasmus' advice to unite humanity and the thinking machines, rather than bring about the absolute destruction of intelligent technology for the second time in history.

Duncan assumed the responsibility of mediator between the two sides; with Erasmus' willing participation, the savant AI being the new Evermind. Erasmus then shared with Duncan all of the codes and sequences of the Machine Empire, and caused Duncan's human super-being to be endowed with all the aspects of the Evermind, as a type of human-machine hybrid. Erasmus then voluntarily "died", while remaining in Other Memory speaking to Duncan. Duncan became the final Kwisatz, and immediately caused a truce to occur between the Machines and Man, who were locked in bitter war over the planets of [[Junction]] and [[Chapterhouse]].

====New Evermind Super-Being====
Duncan then forced peace between man and machine on all inhabitants of the [[Known Universe]]. Idaho had Murbella, the mother of his children, brought to Synchrony, where she could view the events of the truce, which allowed her to rest from her decades-long struggle against the former enemy. Then both Idaho and Murbella traveled back to [[Chapterhouse]], where Duncan met his daughter, Supreme Bashar Janess Idaho. Sheeana was given Synchrony by Duncan, to be a place where she raised up a traditional Bene Gesserit school. Synchrony also became a place of the sandworms, where Leto II had released them during the Kralizec struggle.

Idaho visited the realms of the galaxies where he guided millions of Machine units into helping human-kind; and some machines forged their own civilization on barren, air-less worlds. One such helped place, for example, was Qelso; where Kynes and Stilgar were given hundreds of machines to help divide the world into a place of desert, and the other half a place of greenery that could support all human life. The future of mankind and machine was bright as Idaho guided them both, after several millennia of conflict, into a trustworthy destiny, the [[New Order]] which began to form of both man and machine.<ref name=":4" />

== Abilities and skills ==
''Note:'' As originally the memories of each rebirth of Duncan would pick up with his death on Arraksi, some incarnations had abilities which others did not. All of the following, however, were possessed by his final incarnation, who regained the memories of all of his previous lives.

* '''Swordfighting''': Duncan was trained as a Ginaz Swordmaster, which made him an adept at swordfighting, giving the Atreides a great warrior. Duncan's abilities in this area were demonstrated in multiple instances, perhaps the most notable being his killing of a full nineteen Sardaukar, the finest warriors in the Imperium, in a short time before his first death. This was one of the many motivations of the original taking of his cells by the Emperor's warriors, as well as one of the reasons why the God Emperor appointed him as Commander of his forces and continously brought him back and why the Bene Gesserit continued to resurrect him after Leto II's death.
* '''Resistance to Voice''': In his original lifetime, Duncan was taught by Paul Atreides the techniques used to resist the Bene Gesserit Voice of command, an ability which gave the Sisterhood less power over him, such as when the Reverend Mother Lucilla tried and failed to use Voice on Duncan in his final incarnation on Gammu.
* '''Mentat training''': In his first rebirth as the ghola Hayt, Duncan was trained by the Bene Tleilax as a Mentat in addition to a Zensunni philosopher. The God Emperor later trained him as a Mentat in a few of his later incarnations.
* '''Truthsayer''': Leto II also trained him as a Truthsayer in a few of his lives.

== Relationships ==

=== Paul Atreides ===
{{Quote|Duncan the moral.|Paul's opinion of his teacher|Dune (novel)}}Duncan had a close bond with his beloved Duke's son Paul, who he taught in swordfighting from his earliest years, and Paul was greatly distraught when he fell in battle with Sardaukar on Arrakis, saving him and Jessica. When the first ghola of Duncan, "Hayt", was presented to Paul by the Tleilaxu in 10208 AG, Paul found himself unable to turn the gift down due to his previous friendship with his mentor and his guilt for Duncan's death, and grew a bond with Hayt almost as strong as that he had had with the original Duncan, whose memories were awakened in Hayt after he failed to kill Paul shortly before his walk into the desert and supposed death.

=== Stilgar ===
{{Quote|Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho. The body of [[Turok | our friend]] remains with [[Leto Atreides I | your Duke]]. His water is [[House Atreides | Atreides]] water. It is a bond between us.|Stilgar shortly after the agreemenet of Duncan's duel alleigance|Dune (novel)}}
When Duncan was sent by the Duke Leto to make contact with the Fremen, the first he befriended was Stilgar, Naib of Sietch Tabr, which was the first sietch which Duncan found. In the relatively short time the two knew each other, they grew great respect for each other, Stilgar aknowledging that Duncan measured well in his sietch and observed the customs and honor among the Fremen people. Because of this, when Stilgar met the Duke Leto they agreed that Duncan would have duel alleigance to the Atreides and the Fremen. 

Eighteen years later, when Duncan's first ghola Hayt was presented to Paul, Stilgar initially mistrusted Hayt, declaring that Duncan was dead and this was not him, but ultimately grew a new friendship with the ghola, which grew even deeper when Hayt's memories were restored. At the last, however, Stilgar and Duncan were enemies once more; after Duncan murdered Javid and gave Stilgar the three greatest Fremen insults, he was forced by his honor to finally kill Idaho, an act which Duncan nevertheless called the right choice and one which forced him to subsequently move against the Regent Alia.

=== Bijaz ===
{{Quote|We are like brothers. We grew in the same [[axlotl tank | tank]]: I first and then you.|Bijaz describes his connection with Duncan while imprisoned in [[Arrakeen]]|Dune Messiah (novel)}}Duncan first met the dwarf Bijaz as Hayt, before he regained his original memories. He took an instant dislike to him, mistrusting the dwarf and being wary in his presence and particularly distraught at Bijaz's provocative use of his original name of Duncan Idaho. However, Hayt and Bijaz also had a fundemental connection in that they had been grown in the same Tleilaxu axolotl tank, making Bijaz compare them to borthers.

During Hayt's conversation with Bijaz after their initial meeting, the ghola noted that he radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observor think of ancient idols and threatened to order a guard to strangle him in an attempt to indimiate the dwarf, who also was not fond of Hayt, calling him a callous lout. When Hayt asked what Bijaz planned to do with him, he said that he would do him a simple kindness. Following the reawakening of Duncan's memories in Hayt, Paul ordered him to kill Bijaz before he succumbed to the Tleilaxu plan, and Duncan obeyed without hesitation, saying that he had been the one to do Bijaz the 'kindness.'

=== Moneo Atreides ===
Over many ghola incarnations in the latter days of the reign of Leto II, the God Emperor's majordomo Moneo Atreides grew a great affection for Duncan, although after each rebirth Duncan experienced meeting Moneo all over again. Duncan's last incarnation under Leto II, the one which assassinated him, was at one point easily bested by Moneo in combat, embarrassing him and creating somewhat bitter feelings between them, although the majordomo later apologised.

=== Schwangyu ===
During the long training of his final incarnation in the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu, Duncan had many Bene Gesserit teachers, but he despised none above the Reverend Mother Schwangyu, who was a member of the faction who opposed Mother Superior Tararza and also became a traitor to the Sisterhood for the Bene Tleilax. He eventually repeated the private mantra, 'Damn Schwangyu!', and showed little if any regret for her murder by Honored Matres when the Keep was attacked.

==Behind the Scenes==
Idaho is the only character to appear in all of the six Original Dune novels, albeit in different incarnations. Despite only having a relatively minor appearance in the first book, the character became the focal point of the saga, and his existence as a series of gholas was to serve an ultimate purpose. Throughout the series, Idaho developed from a relatively minor role to that of one of the main protagonists.

In the 1984 '''Dune''' movie, Duncan Idaho was played by late actor '''Richard Jordan '''and is killed earlier in the story, during the attack on Arrakeen where he tried to save Paul and Jessica inside the palace. He was killed by a hunter-seeker which penetrated the shield and stabbed his head). In the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries he was portrayed by '''James Watson''' who was killed by weapons fire from a Harkonnen thopter, while the first Duncan Idaho ghola was portrayed in the '''Children of Dune''' miniseries by '''Edward Atterton'''.

'''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG]]-[[10256 AG]]), born as either '''Jessica Nerus''' or '''Jessica Harkonnen''', was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son, Emperor [[Paul Atreides]], and daughter, [[Alia Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

==History==
As a result of the [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] and [[Tanidia Nerus]]. Due to this, prior to becoming Leto's concubine she was probably referred to as Jessica Nerus in Bene Gesserit records, as opposed to Jessica Harkonnen, which was top secret information and her lineage remained a secret according to [[Bene Gesserit]] tradition.

She was raised from birth by the [[Bene Gesserit]], who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides]] heir [[Leto Atreides I]], to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced [[Bene Gesserit]] education and training.

===With Duke Leto===
====Relationship with Leto Atreides I====
The  [[Bene Gesserit]] plan to couple Jessica with Duke Leto Atreides I initially appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the official concubine of Leto Atreides I, which allowed him to also marry, should such a political union prove advantageous for the Great [[House]].

The relationship between the two quickly evolved into genuine love, and due to this love, Jessica disobeyed her orders and gave birth to a son, Paul Atreides, who would be heir of House Atreides, and ultimately ruined the Bene Gesserit plans.

=== Migration to Arrakis ===
In [[10,191]] AG, when [[House Atreides]] was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]] and their son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]].

When [[House Harkonnen]] seized control of [[Arrakis]], Leto was killed, and Jessica and [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen]]. Her grief over losing [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]], who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with her daughter [[Alia Atreides]].

====Reverend Mother====
The [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own [[Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her. Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged [[Reverend Mother]], Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to [[Reverend Mother]] status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination]] in her daughter Alia.

====After the Death of Paul====
Immediately after the supposed death of Paul, Jessica returned with Gurney to Arrakis, out of concern for her grandchildren, Leto and Ghanima. She was also dismayed about the rising cruelty that her daughter Alia used in consolidating her power for her own gain after Paul's "death". She watched with alarm as Alia created the [[Mahdinate]], a super-religious organization based on the Atreides family. Jessica was also concerned about how Alia banned all forms of opposing expression, and had executed [[Bronso]] of Ix for his writings of the changes that Paul had gone through. She eventually returned to Caladan in deep concern for the Empire.

====Later Years====
Jessica returned to [[Arrakis]], long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the [[Bene Gesserit]]. However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

For her protection against her murdering daughter, [[Duncan Idaho]] (the ghola formerly known as Hayt) "kidnapped" Jessica and took her to Salusa Secundus, home of the exiled Corrino House. There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

===Legacy===
In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

==Physical Appearance==
Jessica is a tall, slim woman with bronze-colored hair that she often wore tied with black ribbon at the crown. She had an oval face with eyes as green as the morning skies of Caladan, a small, slightly upturned nose, and a wide, generous mouth. In her later years her hair became flecked with silver.

'''Paulos XIX Atreides''' ([[10175 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), more commmonly known as '''Paul Atreides''' and also known as '''[[Muad'Dib]]''', '''[[Usul]]''', and '''[[The Preacher]],''' was the founder and first Emperor of the Atreides Empire and the Kwisatz Haderach of the Bene Gesserit. After the death of his father and the exile of House Atreides, Paul found himself a leader among the Fremen people of Arrakis. Fuelled by the historic prophecies of the [[Lisan al Gaib|Lisan al-Gaib]], Paul found himself inching closer and closer to taking power over the galaxy as Emperor. Despite his love and loyalty to [[Chani Kynes]] — with whom he had numerous children — Paul married [[Irulan Corrino]] in his quest for the Emperor's seat in the [[Landsraad]], but found navigating this relationship complex and difficult at times.

The figure known as "Paul Atreides" was perhaps a more fitting subject for the romancer or the folklorist than for the historian. Many of the attributes claimed for him (i.e.,that he was prescient, that he survived the explosion of an atomic warhead) were clearly fantastic; others (i.e., that he was a great warrior) were common to virtually all mythic heroes. Yet the legends about him were persistent and far-flung, and some of them were recorded by ancient historians and biographers whose work in other areas is known to be absolutely accurate. 

== History ==
The mythological or legendary history of Paul Atreides runs, in brief, according to the following line. He was born on Caladan in the year 10175, (he natural son of Blessed Leto Atreides I (10140-10191), the "Red Duke" whose remains are traditionally assumed interred in the long-sought Skull Tomb1 or Skull Place on Arrakis. His mother was the Lady Jessica Harkonnen (10154-10256), the bastard daughter of Siridar-Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (10110-10193) and herself a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. He had one full sister, Alia Atreides-Idaho (10191-10219), and was father of Leto Atreides II, the Summa-Emperor, the Immortal. In his youth on Caladan, Paul was well instructed in all of the martial arts, in voice, in political theory, music, and history. His primary instructors were the family retainers Duncan Idaho1 , Gurney Hal leek, and Thufir Hawat, a mental. Others of his teachers included his mother, already a Bene Gesserit herself but not yet a Reverend Mother, and the legendary Bene Gesserit Great Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who may have been his maternal grandmother. It was the Great Mother who, when he was fifteen years of age, personally subjected him to the test of the gom jabbar and declared him, following the test, to be Kwisatz Haderach (Fulcrum of History). The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV named Leto I planetary governor of Arrakis, replacing the duke's concubine's father, in 10190. The following year Paul and his mother came to live on the planet with which his story has become so closely identified. In that same year the deposed Siridar-Baron Harkonnen, acting with the tacit approval of the Emperor, staged a coup d'etat, assassinated the Red Duke, and forced Paul and his now pregnant mother into hitting among the Fremen of Sietch Tabr. Little is known of Paul's activities during the two years he spent among Fremen in the Great Desert.3 However, m 10193 he emerged from the desert as Usul, at once the leader and symbol of the Arrakis Revolt. He commanded both Fremen and what was left of the Atreides family forces in one of history's few truly masterful military campaigns. In the Battle of Arrakeen he overwhelmingly defeated the combined forces of the Padishah Emperor and the Baron Harkonnen, driving Shaddam IV into exile on Salusa Secundus and effectively assuming control of both Landsraad and CHOAM. Following the Battle of Arrakeen Paul was pronounced Muad'Dib, or Messiah, by the Fremen who in his name carried the Second Jihad across the worlds. He married Irulan Corrino, daughter of the exiled Emperor, but the marriage was a politically inspired formality. In 10209, the thirteenth and final year of his reign, he sired the twins Leto and Ghanima out of his formal concubine, the Fremen woman Chani Liet-Kynes of Sietch-Tabr, who died in childbed. The combination of his personal magnetism, capacity for leadership, vision of a green Arrakis, and reputed prescience turned Paul into an object of veneration, a virtual deity.1 It was in his name that the Second Jihad (10196- 10208) was carried across the heavens and the ultimately unsuccessful transformation of Arrakis from desert into oasis was begun. An assassination attempt in 10205 was the result of a conspiracy among several increasingly insecure political factions including the Spacing Guild, the House Corrino, and the Bene Gesserit. The attack itself was unsuccessful in that Paul miraculously survived a stoneburner explosion. He was blinded by it, however; and, apparently following the ancient Fremen custom that the blind he abandoned in the desert, Paul disappeared voluntarily from Arrakeen shortly after the births of his twin children. It is believed by many that he will one day return in triumph from the desert, and by others that he has from time to time and irregularly over the centuries re-appeared as a portent, a nameless prophet of doom. This, then, is the legendary history of Paul Atreides. It is of no little significance, however, that no conclusive archaeological evidence has been discovered either on Caladan or on Arrakis2 that would prove or disprove either his lineage or, indeed, his very existence. However, such circumstantial evidence as reason, folklore, and "historical" documents made available to the historical anthropological invites some interesting and useful suggestions. This evidence may answer at least some of the more pertinent questions about Paul Atreides, the Kwisatz Haderach, Muad'Dib.

Leto Atreides II/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Leto Atreides II}}
'''Leto Atreides II''' ([[10210 AG]] - [[Timeline (Original Dune)|13728 AG]]) was the third and last ruler of the [[Atreides Empire]], before it began to break up into a loose federation ruled by various powerful groups. He was the second to hold the title of [[Padishah Emperor|Padishah Emperor,]] and the first and only to hold the title of God Emperor.

Leto was born on Arrakis to then-Padishah Emperor [[Paul Atreides]] and his [[Fremen]] [[concubine]] [[Chani Kynes]], the daughter of the great [[Liet Kynes]], just after his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides]]. He and his sister were preborn due to Chani's consumption of the spice melange in large amounts before her death. He was named after the [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]], his paternal grandfather, and [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], his older brother, who was murdered in infancy.

Seeing that their aunt, the [[Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], had been possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of her grandfather [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Leto II and Ghanima planned to prevent her from destroying the Atreides and preventing the [[Golden Path]], the salvation of humanity which Leto worked to bring about for most of his life. This period also saw them evade an assassination attempt by [[House Corrino]] which resulted in the banishment of [[Wensicia Corrino]] by her son [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]], who became Ghanima's lover. Following Alia's suicide as well as the murder of his father Paul, Leto took the title of God Emperor and ruled over humanity with an iron fist for 3,500 years, guiding it away from extinction. 
== History ==

===Upbringing===
Leto II and his twin sister Ghanima were born on planet [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] during the reign of Emperor [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]]. Their mother [[Chani]] died shortly after giving birth to the two children, due in large part to complications arising from large amounts of contraceptives that were surreptitiously given to her by Paul's legal wife [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]]. Paul had anticipated the birth of a daughter, Ghanima, due to his prescient visions. However, Leto's arrival came as a surprise to the [[Emperor]]. Both children were [[pre-born]].

Following Chani's death, and the apparent death of their father in the desert of Arrakis, Leto and his sister became the legal responsibility of Paul's younger sister, the regent Alia. Though they were granted a fine upbringing, little attention was bestowed upon them by their aunt, who was possessed by [[Abomination]] and enthralled by her own power and the mysticism developed around the [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides]] name by Paul.

When they were nine years old, Leto and Ghanima gained the attention of their paternal grandmother, [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]], who returned to Arrakis from [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] to inspect them as part of her obligations to the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]]. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] allies to help protect them.

At this same time, Leto's prescient powers began to emerge. Through visions and intuition he discovered the [[The Golden Path/XD|Golden Path]] that his father had earlier uncovered and begun to follow. However, unlike Paul, Leto developed a greater understanding of the Golden Path's implications. He sensed not only its dangers but also the painful steps that had to be taken to avoid it unraveling, which would be to the peril of humankind.

After Leto and Ghanima escaped a failed assassination attempt by [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]], the two split up, with Ghanima conditioned to believe her brother was dead, so that if she were to be interrogated on his whereabouts, she would not be able to tell the truth.

Leto then slipped into almost total anonymity, using the time and relative seclusion to build a foundation of power and knowledge through which the full impact of the Golden Path could be realized. To enact such steps required a strong (almost brutal) grip on power, and a longevity that would override the shortsightedness and impatience of Man.

Thus, after spending time amongst a variety of fringe Fremen elements, including The [[Preacher]], Leto accepted sand trout upon his body and began the conversion into a human-[[sandworm/XD|sandworm]] hybrid. This transformation (which, at the beginning, was essentially a form of exoskeleton), boosted Leto's strength, reflexes and speed immensely, and he was able to move across large distances on foot.
=== Ascendancy to Emperor===
After his transformation had progressed to a sufficient stage, Leto emerged from the desert and returned to the city of [[Arrakeen]] to confront the possessed Alia and claim the throne of the empire.  After Alia managed to briefly overcome her possession and take her own life, Leto claimed the title of Padishah "God" Emperor and promptly married his sister to consolidate his hegemony. The marriage was purely legal. Ghanima accepted [[Farad'n Corrino]] as her mate, but their descendants would be known as Atreides. The same year, Leto began writing his diaries, which would later be known as the [[Stolen Journals]].

=== Early years as God Emperor ===
Shortly after his ascendancy, Leto ordered a new ghola of [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]] from the Bene Tleilax to serve him as Commander of the Royal Guard, as the original [[Hayt]] ghola had been killed by the Fremen [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]] during the last days of Alia's regency.  During the earliest years of his reign, Leto used the existing Fremen forces as well as Farad'n's [[Sardaukar]] troops, which he had given to him upon his ascension to the throne, to enforce his rule. His armies of Fremen and Sardauakar were commanded by a series of Idaho gholas, which would usually be replaced after they tried to kill him and he killed them in response, although very occasionally he allowed them to have natural deaths.

Over the centuries, Leto's empire, which he ruled as the God Emperor, became multigalactic through gradual growth. Very early on in this expansion, Leto suppressed the ancient Order of Mentats and banned the training of Mentats because they formed a nucleus of independent opposition.

==== Death of Ghanima ====
While Leto lived on for millenia, his sister and wife Ghanima, being but a mortal human woman, died after a relatively normal life in the first years of Leto's rule. After told of her death, Leto, heartbroken, wrote this in his journals:

"The sand beach as grey as a dead cheek, a green tideflow reflects cloud ripples; I stand on the dark wet edge. Cold foam cleanses my toes. I smell driftwood smoke."

He pressed a strand of Ghanima's hair, with a starflower blossom which she once brought to him, between these pages of the journals.

=== The [[Fish Speaker|Fish Speakers]] ===
While for centuries the Fremen and Sardaukar legions were enough for Leto, he ultimately decided that these forces were unsuitable to his needs. Leto believed that male dominated military forces were essentially predatory and would turn against the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy, whereas a female one would tame and calm. He also needed a reliable religious organization to enforce what was coming to be known as [[Leto's Peace]] to ensure the unfolding of the Golden Path. Because of this, he founded a new all-female army to serve him, commanded by the continuing series of Duncan Idahos.

Leto named the army the "Fish Speakers" because the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams.  Although the Fish Speakers were all female, males were still employed as house guards, and their commander Idaho was male. With the exception of the nomadic Amazons who legend described as once ruling part of the Asian steppes of [[Earth|Old Earth]], the Fish Speakers were just about the only effective all-female army known throughout the history of the universe. They were also, in terms of worlds ruled and historical longevity, the most effective military force ever known.

=== Burning of the Nine Historians ===
In his 2,116th year as the God Emperor, the famed Nine Historians came to Leto's attention. The historians angered Leto, for they had lied in their works, and he thought they deserved to be punished. On his orders, they were rendered unconscious, then burned on pyres of their own published works. Not one of them felt the flames, and they died peacefully. When Leto was petitioned by other historians seeking word of their fellows, he said:

"They were destroyed because they lied pretentiously. Have no fear that my wrath will fall upon you because of your innocent mistakes. I am not overly fond of creating martyrs. Martyrs tend to set dramatic events adrift in human affairs. Drama is one of the targets of my predation. Tremble only if you build false accounts and stand pride-fully upon them. Go now and do not speak of this."

Rumors of this spread across the Empire in the years that followed, through accounts which were later judged by the Bene Gesserit to have originated with Leto himself through his majordomo [[Ikonicre]].
===Last Days===

==== Suppression of Wallach IX ====
In the 3,431st year of Leto's reign, he learned through prescience of the Mentat School the Bene Gesserit thought they had hidden on Wallach IX. He sent Duncan Idaho to extinguish the School in order to enforce his ban of the Order, but some of the Mentat-Sisters escaped, hiding their identities and continuing work for the Sisterhood.

==== Visit of Sisters Chenoeh and Tawsuoko ====
In the 3,507th year of Leto's reign, Bene Gesserit Sisters Quintinius Violet Chenoeh and Tawsuoko came to Arrakis to confirm the long-suspected execution of the Nine Historians. Sister Chenoeh was invited to accompany the Fish Speakers in an entourage which accompanied one of Leto's infrequent peregrinations. At one point, she was invited to trot behind the Royal Cart and converse with the God Emperor himself. He told Chenoeh to tell the Sisterhood that he would "resore the outward view" and that the Bene Gesserit of all people should know the dangers of breeding for a particular characteristic, of seeking a defined genetic goal. Leto also told her things which she did not include in her report to the Sisterhood - thoughts on how he would be remembered, but also the statement that he would never see her again because she would not live to become a Reverend Mother. His predictions came true, as Chenoeh died in the Spice Agony due to melange incombatiblity.

==== Events leading up to the assassination ====
A year after Chenoeh's death, Leto sensed the need for the next step on the Golden Path and knew that his rule must end for further progress to occur. Thus Leto used [[Siona Atreides|Siona]], a distant descendant of Ghanima and her concubine Farad'n, and a Duncan Idaho ghola created by the scheming Tleilaxu, after the previous one tried to assassinate him and he had killed him, according to the usual pattern. With them, he sowed the seed of the Atreides genes for future generations.

===== Assassination attempt by the Bene Tleilax =====
During this period, the Bene Tleilax attempted to kill Leto during his progression in the Royal Cart across the Idaho River with his majordomo Moneo Atreides, the newest Duncan Idaho ghola and an entourage of Fish Speakers. Face Dancers approached the group disguised as Museum Fremen (the remnants of the old Fremen of the desert days) before all transforming into a copy of Duncan, each having also obtained uniforms identical to those worn by Idaho. Their hope was to confuse the Fish Speakers into not knowing which Duncan to obey and to kill the God Emperor in the confusion. This failed, however, when Duncan took off his uniform, and so the Fish Speakers knew to obey the commands of the naked Duncan as they fought the Face Dancers. After this incident, he had the Tleilaxu Ambassador publically flogged and expelled.

===== Assassination attempt by the Bene Gesserit =====
Also in the months leading up to the God Emperor's death, two Reverend Mothers and Truthsayers, Tertius Eileen Anteac (who was also a secret Mentat) and Marcus Claire Luyseyal, came to Arrakis. They were warned about the upcoming assassination attempt by the Tleilaxu by Othwi Yake, the assistant to former Ixian ambassador Iyo Kobat, the man who had supplied the weapon Leto's most recent Duncan Idaho had used to try and kill the God Emperor, but their message to him arrived only after the assassinatioin had already failed, because the captain of the Fish Speaker guard would not believe them. Anteac and Luyseyal were granted an audience with Leto, however, at the end of which he agreed to continue the spice allotment of the Sisterhood at its current level for the next decade despite a further attempt at assassination using spice essence by the Sisters.

===== Hwi Noree and death of Malky =====
Leto fell in love with the new Ixian Ambassador [[Hwi Noree]]. Hwi was a direct female clone of Leto's former friend and advisor [[Malky]] created by the Tleilaxu in an Ixian [[no-chamber]]. Since Hwi was conceived and raised outside of his [[prescience|prescient]] abilities, Leto was unaware of her until she was presented to him as an ambassador. Leto was instantly smitten with Noree, and within a few months proposed marriage to her, and set the date of betrothal. After the announcement that Leto and Hwi were to wed, Hwi's uncle Malky was recalled to Arrakis by Leto, and murdered by Moneo after a last personal discussion with his old friend.

====The assassination====
A few weeks later, Leto, Hwi, and Moneo lost their lives when Siona ordered the bridge they were crossing to be cut by a lasgun by her assistant, [[Nayla]]. They all fell to their deaths into the [[Idaho River]]. In dying, he released the dormant sandtrout from his body. These began to reverse the terraforming on Arrakis. The planet begin to revert into a desert world from the realized Fremen dream of a lush paradise.
===Legacy During the Scattering and Later ===
During and after his reign, Leto II was viewed as an extremely controversial figure. Following Leto's death, a chain of dramatic events took place over a span of 1,500 years. This included the [[Famine Times]], [[the Scattering]], and the recreation of the [[sandworm]]s on [[Arrakis]], which emerged from the [[sandtrout]] that escaped from Leto's body when he fell into the water. Many of the established power brokers who existed at the start of his rule were either destroyed or significantly weakened, due to his draconian tactics and a monopoly on the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. To his admirers, Leto II was known as the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], but to his enemies (including the [[Bene Gesserit]]) he was labeled [[the Tyrant]] of the [[known universe]]. He was worshipped by the Bene Tleilax as the Prophet of God after his death.

The religion of the God Emperor also continued on Dune, which became known as Rakis. He was worshipped by the priests of the new Church of the Divided God, which became the dominant force on Rakis and had essential control of the planet, as the great Divided God and the third member of the Holy Triumvirate of Heaven, the other being his grandmother Jessica, and his father, Muad'Dib. It was also believed by the Priests of Rakis that he had carried within him the spirit of his brother, Leto II the Elder. This worship continued until the [[Battle of Rakis|attack on the planet]] by the [[Honored Matres]] and also with those returned to the Old Empire from the Scattering, who called Leto II Dur or [[Guldur]].

==== Living on in the sandworms ====
It was also said that within each sandworm that grew on Arrakis after his death, a pearl of his consciousness existed. This theory was supported when,  1,500 years after his death, an Arrakeen girl named [[Sheeana]], who was a direct descendant of Siona and Duncan Idaho who later became the youngest ever Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, displayed the power to control the worms.
===Ghola 1,500 years after Assassination===
====On the ''Ithaca''====
1500 years after the death of the God-Emperor, aboard the [[No-ship/XD|no-ship]] the ''[[Ithaca]]'', Duncan Idaho, and Sheeana decided to create a [[ghola]] with the cells of Leto II from the [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]]'s [[nullentropy]] tube. As he grew towards his teenage years, Leto II's ghola was a quiet, mysterious child, due in some part to not being raised with the ghola of his twin Ghanima. As Leto matured, he was explicably drawn to the hold of the ship, where a kilometer of sand held the last remaining sandworms from Dune.

As Leto reached the age of maturity, Leto was almost assassinated in an algae-food processing plant on the ship. One of the two [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s aboard the vessel decided that Leto being allowed to continue living was in direct conflict to the Outside [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]]'s desire. As Leto visited the sandworms in the hold of the ship, the Face Dancer of [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]] actually tried to save Leto's life, as the Face Dancer thought himself to be Hawat. Days later, it was revealed that it was the Enhanced Face Dancer who was impersonating the Jewish [[Rabbi/XD|Rabbi]], who desired Leto's death before he became a teen.

====On the Day of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]]====
=====The ''Ithaca'' is Captured=====
A week later, the ''Ithaca'' was captured by the Enemy, who were revealed to the crew and passengers of the ship to be [[Omnius]]/[[Daniel/XD|Daniel]] and [[Erasmus]]/[[Marty/XD|Marty]], reborn leaders of the new [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] empire. The ship and select passengers were then brought to [[Synchrony]], capital of the Machine Empire, so that Omnius and Erasmus could capture the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], whom Erasmus predicted was most likely aboard the ship.

=====Worms Released onto Synchrony=====
Most of the passengers associated directly with the ghola of Paul Atreides were led to the [[Cathedral]] by the machines in the heart of Synchrony; but Sheeana and Leto were left behind and stayed on the ship, with ideas of their own. As Leto communicated with the sandworms in the ship's hold, he told Sheeana that they desired to be released out into the semi-arid world. Leto and Sheeana then released the sandworms into the Machine capital, and the worms destroyed much of the city as they burrowed deep into the planet's crust, and as they came up they shattered many of the flow-metal buildings.

Meanwhile, galaxy altering events occurred in the Cathedral: The two gholas of Paul Atreides and [[Paolo]] battled and dueled to Paolo ending up in a coma, and Omnius was banished permanently to another plane of existence by [[Norma Cenva/XD|Norma Cenva]]/[[Oracle of Time]].

The loss of the Omnius [[Evermind]] contributed even more greatly to Leto's guidance of the worms destruction, as the robotic machines were near paralyzed in dealing with the worms as they coursed through their main city. Knowing that the machines were distracted by the melee enabled [[Khrone]], leader of the [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s, to declare that the time of Face Dancer hegemony over the Known Universe had arrived. To counter this threat, Erasmus then activated his long before-placed "kill switch" he had put into their genetic make up hundreds of years before, and using the galaxy-wide [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]], all of Khrone's Face Dancers throughout the [[Known Universe]] were instantly killed.

Before the sandworms could reduce all of Synchrony to rubble, the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, Duncan Idaho, was revealed. He shared throughout flow-metal memory with Erasmus, creating a man/machine super-being who would guide the galaxies in a future of peace and prosperity.

=====Permanently One with the Sandworms=====
No longer needing to guide the sandworms on a course of destruction, Leto realized that he was happiest when embonded as one with the giant creatures, and placed his body as a type of genetic material inside on the worms ring casings. Leto merged with the worm, and became this time, a non-conscious human/sandworm genetic entity.

== Name ==

=== Etymology ===
'''Leto Atreides II''' was named after his paternal grandfather, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]], and his deceased brother [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]]. Due to his brother [[Stiros]] of the [[Church of the Divided God]] called him '''Leto III''' rather than '''Leto II''', but was argued with by [[Hedley Tuek]], who told him that the spirit of the older Leto had been reborn in the younger.

Those who worshipped him on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] called him the '''Great God Dur''', meaning "Great God of Darkness", or '''Guldur''', signifying black magic.

=== Titles ===
During his reign and later Leto was commonly known by his title of '''God Emperor''', but after his death he was more commonly called the '''Tyrant''', predominantely by the [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]], who also referred to him as the '''Worm''', '''Worm God''', or '''Old Worm'''. The Bene Tleilax, on the other hand, privately called him the '''Prophet''' or '''Prophet of God''' due to their belief that he was a prophet of their god.

Alia Atreides/XD

{{Ex-Or,DE|Alia Atreides}}
[[Image:AliciaWitt.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Alicia Witt played Alia Atreides in the 1984 ''Dune'' movie]]
'''Alia Atreides''' ([[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), also known as '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' to the [[Fremen]] and called '''Hawt the Fish Monster''' on the outer worlds, was the posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], born on the planet [[Arrakis]]. She was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides]]. As [[regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based on the cult of her personality. She later leapt to her death in defiance of the possession by the spirit of a younger [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] retained in her [[Other Memory]].

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Alia was still in the womb when Jessica took the [[Water of Life]]. Thus she was [[pre-born]], and highly susceptible to [[Abomination]] from before birth.

After living with the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] for several years, she was present in the palace in [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]] when her brother and his forces successfully conquered the combined forces of the [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Emperor's]] [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] and [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]]. During the invasion she poisoned Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] - her maternal grandfather - with a [[Gom Jabbar]].

Alia, having been born a full [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]], was able to help [[Paul Atreides/XD|Emperor Paul]] as he consolidated his rule in Arrakeen and throughout the [[Known Universe/XD|Known Universe]]. She helped him rule on Dune while he was off-planet visiting [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], helping to settle matters between the Fremen and other locals.

When the former Count [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] and his wife, [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]], brought their young daughter [[Marie Fenring]], to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], to be raised by  Paul and the Royal Court, Alia was chosen as her companion. Alia was astute and observed Marie, and noted her fighting style strengths and weaknesses. Some time later when the Fenring's re-joined their daughter, the couple sprang their assassination plot at a celebratory banquet.

Alia was able to kill Marie Fenring first before Marie was able to kill Paul, driving a blade deep into her body. This action earned her the nickname of Alia of the "Knife", and Alia was proclaimed a heroine.

===Regency===
[[Image:Alia01.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alia as Imperial Regent]]
====Establishing her rule====
With the seeming death of Paul, and his children [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule, Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] of the [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides Empire]]. She was corrupted by power and established a cult of personality, using rich trappings and grandiose titles such as the [[Mahdinate]] to build considerable political weight.

====Against Bronso====
It was during this time of crisis when her mother Jessica, secretly visited Arrakis to observe the state and condition of her twin grandchildren, and the rising paranoia of her daughter against true and supposed enemies. Alia lashed out against Paul's childhood friend, [[Bronso of Ix/XD|Bronso Vernius]] of [[Ix/XD|Ix]], and had him executed when he wrote of Paul's failings as Emperor. It was also during this time, that she and the ghola of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] became husband and wife.

====Into Abomination====
Shortly thereafter, Alia fell fully into Abomination, and was secretly tormented by the living personalities of countless ancestors. Chief among these was the personality of Vladimir Harkonnen, who sought to use his granddaughter as a tool to reclaim power from beyond the grave.

====Relationships====
[[Image:Alia02.jpg|thumb|250px|As Abomination, Alia takes comfort in the metaphorical arms of Baron Harkonnen]]
Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with Fremen was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.

Though she loved and admired Paul, her brother, she also partly resented his influence. And her love for Duncan Idaho was ultimately destroyed by a casual affair with [[Javid]], one of her priests who secretly served the Fremen insurgents who plotted against her.

====Death====
During the same years in which she held herself aloof from family and friends, Alia indulged in massive doses of [[Spice Melange/XD|melange]], ostensibly for the purpose of broadening her [[prescience/XD|prescient]] vision. However, Alia lacked her brother's prescient ability, and the [[spice trance]] most often failed her. The same drug which had initially keyed her sensitivity to her ancestral voices could be depended upon to keep those same voices from becoming blurred or unavailable. As a result, Alia's heavy melange consumption became a means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors and gave them power.

Alia's actions during her Regency were those of a power-hungry woman aided by the memories of generations of ambitious rulers and princelings. Her every manoeuvre, including her marriage to the first Duncan Idaho ghola, was seen as having been performed in order to solidify her own position, and her manipulation of the children in whose names she ruled was also considered a devious maneuver. Not content with having destroyed herself, she set about to lead her niece and nephew into similarly destructive ways. Since the most direct way of achieving this goal involved the children's becoming enmeshed in their ancestral memories, Alia continually tried to interest them in the spice trance.

Alia ordered the assassination of [[The Preacher]], despite knowing it was her beloved brother. Upon Leto's return from the desert, he gave her a choice, [[Trial of Possession]] or suicide. Realising that she would not pass the Trial, Alia threw herself from a high window to her death, a death that was witnessed by her mother Jessica, the Atreides twins, and Farad'n Corrino. 

Had it not been for her death, Alia could have continued to rule for several centuries by regenerating her cellular structure. According to Fremen tradition, as with all Abominations, the only cure was death.

===Legacy===
The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. In the months prior to Leto II's death, a cult of Alia was discovered on [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] by Duncan Idaho's agents. Ultimately however, Alia's influence vanished after Leto's death, some three and a half thousand years after her own death.

===Ghola ===
Five thousand years later, aboard the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]] the ''[[Ithaca]]'', during the advent of [[Kralizec]], the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Burgh]] decided to decant a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] of Alia in the ongoing and upcoming struggle against the [[Enemy/XD|Outside Enemy]]. Twenty-one years after the captives and crew of the vessel fled [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]], Alia was birthed from an [[Axlotl tank/XD|axlotl tank]], as an "aware" newborn infant again into the world. Sheeana had ordered her tank flooded with changed [[Water of Life]] to raise her consciousness. She was eventually murdered on [[Synchrony]] by a ghola of the Baron Harkonnen.

==Behind the Scenes==

In the ''[[Children of Dune]]'' TV mini-series, Alia kills herself with a [[crysknife]].

Alia was played by three different actresses [[wikipedia:Alicia Witt|Alicia Witt]] in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 movie]], Laura Burton in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|Dune 2000 miniseries]], and [[wikipedia:Daniela Amavia|Daniela Amavia]] in the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]].

Irulan Corrino/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Irulan Corrino}}


[[Image:IrulanCorrino1.jpg|thumb|Irulan Corrino, from the Sci-Fi Channel's Dune miniseries (2000), portrayed by Julie Cox.]]

Princess''' Irulan Corrino''' [b. [[10162 AG|10164 AG]]] was the eldest daughter of the 81st [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]], and [[Anirul Corrino/XD|Anirul]], a [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] of [[Hidden Rank]]. She was also the wife, in title only, of Emperor [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], and an important historian who chronicled the events of Paul's rise to the Imperial throne through a series of written works.

== Biography ==

=== Upbringing ===

As the eldest of five daughters to Shaddam, Irulan was raised under auspicious circumstances in the Imperial Court, and received an excellent education through the Bene Gesserit. Like her younger sisters [[Chalice Corrino|Chalice]], [[Wensicia Corrino/XD|Wensicia]], [[Josifa Corrino|Josifa]], and [[Rugi Corrino/XD|Rugi]], Irulan was conditioned to be a lady of refinement and elegance.

From an early age, Irulan's father Shaddam IV expected her to become Empress after his death, or at the very least to wed a political ally and retain House Corrino's hegemony over the Imperium. The Bene Gesserit also saw potential in the girl, and gave her sufficient training so that they could exploit her at some point in the future, were she to find herself in a position of power.

However, despite the expectations of others, Irulan remained only an average Bene Gesserit adept, and retained a strong sense of personal identity and ambition: qualities that caused tension between herself and her equally strong-minded father.

=== The plot against House Atreides ===

Irulan was gradually drawn into the events on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] as her father orchestrated with [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] his plot to destroy Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]] and [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. 

As Leto's power and influence grew in the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]], there was wide speculation that Irulan could be married to his son, Paul to symbolize Shaddam's selection of House Atreides to peacefully assume the Imperial throne after his death; but the Emperor's jealousy of the "Red Duke" Leto instead led him to orchestrate a plot to destroy him. 

Irulan wrote everything important in her private diary:

''"My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance between them — my father and this man in the portrait--both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. 'Princess-daughter, my father said, I would that you'd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.' My father was 71 years old at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was only 14 years old, but yet I remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.”'' — In My Father's House by the Princess Irulan

To get House Harkonnen to assist with this scheme, the Emperor offered to potentially give Irulan in marriage to the Harkonnen heir apparent, the na-Baron [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen/XD|Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]], along with the riches of the Arrakis [[fief]]. 

Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] favored this arrangement, as he believed such a union and plan would greatly assist in the establishment of a Harkonnen Empire. 

Irulan was so ensnared, and would oppose being used as such a pawn.

The plot against the Atreides was executed: lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable [[melange/XD|melange]] operation there, the Atreides were soon attacked by Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]]). 

Leto was killed, but Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother, [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]] fled into the desert and were presumed dead. 

A crisis on Arrakis began when the mysterious Muad'Dib emerged as an effective leader of the native Fremen tribes against the rule of the Harkonnens. He was, of course, a very-much-alive Paul Atreides.

=== The Downfall of the Corrino Empire ===
When the mysterious [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]] emerged as an effective leader of the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]], House Atreides was deposed from Arrakeen rule, Irulan became entangled further with the Bene Gesserit, who sought to use her as a spy against her father.

Later, when Paul Atreides succeeded in conquering the Imperial strongholds on Arrakis, Irulan was with her father in [[Arrakeen]]. 

She subsequently witnessed Paul's defeat of the Harkonnen na-Baron in an [[kanly]] act that effectively destroyed House Harkonnen. 

Then, Irulan was made to marry the Fremen leader - much to the concern of Paul's consort, [[Chani/XD|Chani]] - in order for Paul to legitimise his rule and take away the [[Golden Lion Throne/XD|Golden Lion Throne]] from Shaddam IV. 

Being unaware of Paul's devotion to Chani, Irulan agreed to the union, believing she would be the one to produce the Imperial heir apparent, and thus retain House Corrino's power over the Known Universe.
=== An Unhappy Marriage to Paul Atreides ===

Following the consolidation of Paul's rule over the Imperium, Irulan quickly discovered that she was Paul's wife in title only, and that his beloved Fremen consort, Chani, was his exclusive partner and the sole bearer of his children.

Jealousy and resentment drove her to secretly drug Chani with dangerous contraceptives, so that she would not produce his heirs.

However, the scheme did not work as intended, and Irulan was left with remorse when Chani died after giving birth to twins named [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].
This act, combined with the apparent death of Paul Atreides after he walked into the desert a blind man, led her to devote herself to House Atreides and her two surviving stepchildren.

Through their developmental years, and following the rise of the [[God-Emperor]] Leto Atreides II, Irulan spent her remaining years studying and documenting all the events that came to pass since House Atreides took control of Arrakis in 10,191 A.G.

'''Arrakis''', also called '''Dune''' by the Fremen and later the final Duncan Idaho, and '''Rakis''' after the death of the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], was a harsh desert planet located on the far edge of the Old [[Galactic Padishah Empire/XD|Imperium]], in the [[Stars#Alpha Carinae|Canopus]] star system. It later became the Imperium's capital world under [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib's]] new empire. It was the original, and for some time, ''only'' source of the [[Spice Melange/XD|Spice Melange]], which was vitally important for [[space travel]].

==Location==
Arrakis was located far from the major populated worlds and their trade routes. It was orbited by two moons: the first and larger of these bore a formation which looked like a human fist; the second had a formation that resembled a [[kangaroo mouse]].

==Human Population==
During the times of the [[Old Empire]], imperial scientists had various laboratories scattered across Arrakis, to estimate its worth. With the rise of the [[Titans]], all the scientists left Arrakis out of a fear that interstellar travel might break down in the upcoming turmoil.

Later the [[Zensunni]] settled on Arrakis, maybe as part of their exodus, to flee the Titans and their robotic armies. They mainly made a living by scavenging the desert for anything that could be sold to the merchants at the spaceport. The [[sandworm/XD|sandworms]] were considered demons during these early years.

The distinction of the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] began with [[Selim]]. His [[Naib]] banned him from the [[Sietch]] for the good of the tribe. But Selim was innocent, so he never forgave his Naib and saw no need to return to a normal life. He was the first who learned how to ride a worm and became [[Selim Wormrider]]. He gathered followers, who despised the extravagant sinful life of their fellows as well. Selim laid the foundation for a cult, in which the worms were considered godly. Decades later, Selim's group mixed with [[Zenshiites|zenshiite]] slaves, who had escaped from [[Poritrin]], led by [[Ishmael]]. Ishmael declared themselves the ''free men''. Years later, the free men again split into two factions: one would live on in the desert as nomads. The other faction would re-join the rest of the population to make an easier living. With this, the name ''Fremen'' spread to Arrakis' whole population.

===Fight for Survival===
The fight for survival on this harsh world had long dominated the Fremens's cultural identity. The brutal environment of Arrakis necessitated the frugal use energy and resources, water most of all. Additionally, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for extensive combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of Arrakis to drive off invaders who often possessed far superior technology and formal training then themselves. 

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal collectives, known as sietches, which were led by a Naib. Each sietch resides within one of the numerous rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood.

Other human settlers included the graben population in the urbanised areas. This population consisted of traders and off-worlders who tried to make their living through the water or spice trades. Indeed, the promise of riches through the sale of water to the Fremen, and the sale of the spice melange to other worlds brought many people to the more populous areas of the planet.

Arrakis also saw the peoples of [[House/XD|Great Houses]] populate the planet. As a [[fief|siridar fief]] of the Imperium, whichever House|Great House had possession of this fief would typically maintain a large population that included armies, administrative staff, Family members, household staff, a spy network, and [[richece]].

==Environment==



[[Image:L Dune Map.jpg|thumb|North Pole of Arrakis]]
The surface of Arrakis consisted almost exclusively of dry dune deserts, and was the reason for the planet's alternative name ''Dune''. Various weathered mountain ranges stretched across the planet, breaking up the deserts and providing shelter to the limited native lifeforms. Rock outcrops also littered the planet's surface.

The atmosphere comprised of nitrogen and oxygen in measures compatible enough to allow human beings to live on the planet without the need for respiratory equipment. The production method of atmospheric oxygen sufficient to sustain limited biological life is through sandworm's metabolism, which acts like oxygen producing factory.

Vast reserves of water were located deep within the mountains of the planet, as well as within countless [[sandtrout]]. Small amounts of water vapour existed in the atmosphere, and were harvested via [[windtrap]]s.

The northern pole of the planet sat on a large plate of bedrock, and was ringed by mountain ranges. Thus it was protected from sandworm incursion, until the Fremen, led by [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], used [[atomics]] to destroy the [[Shield Wall/XD|Shield Wall]] shortly before he proclaimed himself Emperor.

This geography, combined with the milder climate, made human habitation at the pole more comfortable, and explained the presence of the capital city [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]].

==Biology==
Little native life survived on Arrakis, due to its scorching heat and dry climate. The various lifeforms that did endure were eclipsed by the sandworms, which roamed the deep deserts of the planet. The sandworms played an important role in the production of melange, and aggressively protected their desert territory from humans and other sandworms alike.

The Fremen, traditionalist human clans, also eeked out a life on the planet, existing in the caves of rocky outcrops and mountain ranges that broke up the planet-wide desert.

Other lifeforms on Arrakis included sandtrout (which interplays heavily with the sandworm); the [[Muad'Dib (mouse)|kangaroo mouse]], known to the Fremen as Muad'Dib. Some forms of flora existed on the planet, including the [[creosote bush]]. Various birds and bats were also known to exist in the ecosystems of the planet. Some of these were domesticated by the Fremen.

Specifically,the kinds of life forms that existed on Arrakis included:
* Poverty grass
* Ephemerals - chenopods, pigweeds, amarinth
* Scotch broom
* Low lupine
* Vine eucalyptus (from [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]])
* Dwarf tamarisk
* Shore pine
* Candelilla
* Suguaro
* Bis-naga
* Shrubs and bushes, including camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa, burrow Bush, sand verbena, evening primrose, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush.
Various animals, including:
* Burrowing animals: kit fox, kangaroo mouse, desert hare, sand terrapin
* Predators, including the desert hawk, dwarf owl, eagle, desert owl
* Insects, namely [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], trapdoor spider, biting wasp, wormfly
* The desert bat

==History==

=== Desertification ===
Long before the Old Empire, Arrakis was a water-rich world. However, the Muadru came to the planet and brought the sandtrout, which began it's desertification. This was also the beginning of the sandtrout-sandworm-melange cycle.

===Old Empire and Time of Titans===
During the times of the Old Empire, imperial scientists had various laboratories on Arrakis, to estimate it's worth. With the rise of the Titans, all scientists left Arrakis out of fear interstellar travel might break down in the upcoming turmoil. Later Zensunni settled on Arrakis, maybe as part of their exodus, to flee the Titans and their robotic armies. They mainly made a living by scavenging the desert for anything that could be sold to the merchants at the spaceport. When Yansuph Ashkoko discovered the geriatric spice melange on the planet, a small offworld market was created for the substance.

By the time of the protracted war between [[Omnius]] and the [[League of Nobles]], Arrakis had become a remote trading outpost and haven for fugitives. Shortly after the rise of the [[Thinking Machines/XD|thinking machines]], various pacifist [[Zensunni]]s crashed onto the planet in a prototype warp vessel to escape the wrath of both humans and sentinent machines. On Arrakis they started a barely self-sustaining culture that shunned outsiders. 

=== The Fremen ===
Centuries later, Selim Wormrider changed this culture forever by beginning a band of outlaws who became the first wormriders and manufactured the first stillsuits. This group ultimately merged with Ishmael and his Zensunni followers who fled from Poritrin, into the Free Men of Dune. However, a schism emerged when certain Free Men trading with VenKee Enterprises, lead by El’hiim, the son of Selim, moved closer to [[Arrakis City]], their lifestyle becoming softer. This angered Ishmael and the more conservative Free Men. Twenty years later, when slavers began to harass the Zensunni settlements. Ishmael and a group of Free Men harassed by slavers moved into the deep desert, and by adapting to the harsh lifestyle would during the next centuries become the [[Freemen of Dune]] and later the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] people. [[El'hiim]] and his followers, on the other hand, slowly merge dwith the townfolk of the North Pole of Arrakis.

===Corrino Empire===
A [[Project Amal|Corrino plot]] to develop a spice alternative or synthesise it, lead to the Arrakis ecology becoming of some interest to Emperor [[Elrood Corrino IX/XD|Elrood IX]], and his son [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam]]. Previous experiments had seen sandworms die shortly after they were transplanted from Arrakis to another world, regardless of how faithful a reproduction of their ecosystem was made. As a result, Elrood sent his Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] to analyze the planet's ecosystem. Kynes' analysis of Arrakis convinced him that the planet was once a lush and fertile world. He believed that through careful and multi-generational planning, Arrakis could once again become a paradise. The Fremen, enchanted by Kynes' stories of large bodies of water, greenery and mild temperatures not requiring [[stillsuit]]s, followed him with fervour. Kynes became so fascinated by the planet and its people that he married into a Fremen tribe, eventually being absorbed by their culture and coming to be known as a leader among the Fremen. He saw so much potential in the planet and its people that he sought to hide its secrets from the Emperor. This lead eventually to Kynes' death; but not before leaving a legacy with the inhabitants of [[Dune]], teaching his son [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]] his knowledge, and a long-lasting vision for the Fremen people.

===[[Ascension of House Atreides/XD|Ascension of House Atreides]] & the [[God Emperor]]===
During Shaddam's rule, in 10,191 [[A.G.]], [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] arrived on Arrakis, and took over control of the planet and spice production. By this time, the planet had for some years been under the brutal control of Atreides enemies [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]], who managed spice mining operations on behalf of Emperor Shaddam IV. The Atreides rule was cut short, however, through a betrayal in a conspiracy by Harkonnen and Imperial forces.

House Atreides went into hiding, but after seeking refuge with the Fremen, they quickly became their leaders through their inherent ability to command loyalty, and through their promise that Kynes' vision would be realised through their rule. Three years later, Paul Atreides under the Fremen name of Muad'Dib, using Atreides Family atomics, created a gap in the Shield Wall that had been protecting Arrakeen since the dawn of time. Riding into the city on sandworms, the Fremen defeated Harkonnen and Corrino forces, and [[Paul Atreides]] declared victory and ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Arrakis became the new seat of power for both the Empire and the religious jihad that [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]] unleashed upon the known universe.

Eventually, Paul's limited interpretation of the [[Golden Path]] strategy led to the terraforming of the planet, carried out by Paul's son, Leto II, the long-lived [[God-Emperor]]. Over several thousand years, Arrakis was transformed into a green and temperate world much more habitable to humans, just as Kynes had hoped. Ultimately however, the new ecology was dangerous to the giant sandworms, and they all but became extinct under Leto II's rule. During this time, new mountain ranges, forests, and rivers came into existence. Off world animals were introduced and took root on the planet. Only Leto's [[Sareer]] remained evidence that Arrakis was once a desert planet.

After some 3,500 years of rule, Leto II was assassinated while crossing the [[Idaho River]] after the Guardian Wall of the Sareer opened. Leto fell into the river, and his worm-body was destroyed by the water, which was toxic to him. His body decomposed into sandtrout that absorbed water, eventually leading to a recreation of the conditions required for the sandworms to appear. Over the next 1500 years, Arrakis gradually returned to desert. Also during this time, many names for places had become shortened. Arrakis eventually became known as '''Rakis''', while the city of Arrakeen became known simply as '''Keen'''. Following Leto's death, control of the planet was taken over by Leto's [[Fish Speaker/XD|Fish Speakers]], the [[Rakian Priesthood]], and the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]].

===The Scattering & The [[Return of the Honored Matres/XD|The Return of the Honored Matres]]===
As most of humanity had gone out into [[The Scattering]], the returning [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] 1500 years later, caused the most fear about Rakis. The humans of the Scattering had been weaned of any need for melange, and the Matres especially, saw eliminating spice as a way to break the power brokers, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the [[Tleilaxu]], who had stayed behind in the Empire.

In an attempt to destroy the center of spice production, the planet was eventually attacked and decimated by the Honored Matres with their space-borne incinerating [[Weapon, the|Weapon]], an action that totally destroyed all biological life; and rendered parts of the planet's surface akin to fused glass. However, their efforts did not totally succeed, and the Bene Gesserit managed to escape with a ghola of Duncan Idaho, [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]], their leader [[Darwi Odrade]], and a single sandworm to [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]]. The sandworm managed to survive the transplant, and revived hopes in the Bene Gesserit to recreate Arrakis, or "Dune", on other planets through the [[Known Universe/XD|Known Universe]].

Upon arriving at the secret Gesserit capital planet of Chapterhouse, Odrade had the worm drowned, and some of its' sandtrout placed into the soil of Chapterhouse. Slowly over time, the world was slowly terra-formed into a planet similar to Dune, with a sandworm [[Spice Melange/XD|spice cycle]].

===Waff & the Return to Rakis===
A few decades later, a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] of the [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff/XD|Tylwyth Waff]] was awakened by the Honored Matres and a Tleilaxu scribe in [[Bandalong/XD|Bandalong]], just prior to battles at the end of the age, during the advent of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]] began. As such, it was Waff's goal to re-introduce sandworms to the planet, in which he believed the essence of the God Emperor, who was the Tleilaxu [[Prophet]], lived. Having been rescued from the destruction of Bandalong by [[Spacing Guild|the Guild]], Waff strengthened captured sandworm specimens he had, by giving them armored mouth sections, in hopes they could burrow through sections of Rakis' fused-glass surface.

Waff and his specimens were dropped off onto the surface of Rakis, with a small entourage' of assistants. To Waff's dismay, he released his armor-enhanced sandworms, but they soon died. Waff was overjoyed later, as deep rumblings hundreds of feet below the surface of Rakis, revealed sandworms that had survived the attacks decades earlier. As the worms shot to the surface, Waff, exuberant at the survival of the worms from the Matres' attack over 40 years earlier, decided to commit religious suicide and allowed the worms to devour him.

Later, after the events of Kralizec, and the revelation of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] as the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], the gholas of Paul Atreides and Chani, newly married, resettled on Arrakis. The planet had developed a new spice cycle, producing melange, as the sandworms had flourished and multiplied.

==Behind the Scenes==
The length of day and night on Arrakis at the poles were not explained clearly in the novels by [[Frank Herbert]].

Very little information of the pre-Imperium history of the planet was mentioned in the original novels by [[Frank Herbert]]. However, the prequel novels by his son [[Brian Herbert]] and co-author [[Kevin J. Anderson]] stated that the existence of Arrakis was known to the [[Old Empire]].

The name Arrakis is believed to come from the Arabic name الراقص ar-rāqiṣ, meaning "the dancer", originally a star-name for [[Wikipedia:Mu Draconis|Mu Draconis]].

Arrakis
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:Arrakis_planet.jpg|thumb|266px|Artist's portrayal]]
'''Arrakis''', also known as "'''Dune'''", and later "'''Rakis'''" after the fall of [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], is a harsh desert planet located on the far edge of the Old [[Imperium]] in the [[Stars#Alpha Carinae|Canopus]] star system. It later became the Imperium's center under [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib's]] empire. It was the original and for a long time sole source of the [[Spice Melange]], which was vital for [[space travel]].

==Location==
Arrakis was located far from the major populated worlds and their trade routes. It was orbited by two moons: the first and larger of these bore a formation that looked like a human fist; the second had a formation that resembled a [[kangaroo mouse]].

===Fight for Survival===
The fight for survival on the harsh world had long dominated the Fremen's cultural identity. The brutal environment of Arrakis necessitated frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. Also, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of Arrakis to fend off offworld opponents who often possess far superior technology and formal training.

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal tribes, known as [[sietch]]es, which were led by a [[Naib|naib]]. Each sietch resides within one of the many rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood.

Other human settlers included the graben population in the urbanized areas. This population consisted of traders and offworlders who tried to make their living through trading water or spice. The promise of riches through the sale of water to the Fremen and the sale of the spice melange to other worlds brought many people to the more populous areas of the planet.

Arrakis also saw the peoples of [[House|Great Houses]] populate the planet. As a [[fief|siridar fief]] of the [[Imperium]], whichever [[House|Great House]] had possession of this fief would typically maintain a large population that included armies, administrative staff, family members, household staff, a spy network, and [[richece]].

After his successful invasion of Arrakis, the Baron mentions to Nefud that there are 5,000,000 people living on Arrakis. By this he means the people of the towns and villages. He is later stunned to hear from Thufir Hawat that the Fremen account for at least an additional 10,000,000. Given a total population of 15,000,000 on a planet as harsh as Arrakis.

The surface of Arrakis consisted almost exclusively of dry dune deserts, hence the planet's alternative name, ''Dune''. Various weathered mountain ranges stretched across the planet, breaking up the deserts and sheltering the limited native lifeforms. Rock outcroppings also littered the planet's surface.

The atmosphere consisted of 75.4% nitrogen, 23% oxygen<ref>''[[Appendix I: The Ecology of Dune]]''</ref> and negligible amounts of trace gases; given the abundance of oxygen, the atmosphere allowed human beings to live on the planet without respiratory equipment. The production method of atmospheric oxygen sufficient to sustain limited biological life is through sandworm metabolism, which acts like an oxygen-producing factory.

Vast reserves of water were located deep within the mountains of the planet, as well as within countless [[sandtrout]]. Small amounts of water vapor existed in the atmosphere and were harvested via [[windtrap]]s.

The northern pole of the planet sat on a large plate of bedrock and was ringed by mountain ranges. Thus it was protected from [[sandworm]] incursion, until the Fremen, led by [[Paul Atreides]], used [[Atomics|atomics]] to destroy a large section of the [[Shield Wall]] shortly before he proclaimed himself emperor.

This geography, combined with the milder climate, made human habitation at the pole more comfortable and explained the presence of the capital city [[Arrakeen]].

==Biology==
Little native life survived on Arrakis, owing to its scorching heat and dry climate. The various lifeforms that did endure were eclipsed by the [[Sandworm|sandworms]], which roamed the deep deserts of the planet. The [[sandworms]] played an important role in the production of [[Spice Melange|melange]], and they aggressively protected their desert territory from humans and other sandworms alike.

The [[Fremen]], traditionalist human clans, also eked out a life on the planet, existing in the caves of rocky outcrops and mountain ranges that broke up the planetwide desert.

Other lifeforms on Arrakis included [[sandtrout]] (which interplays heavily with the [[Sandworm|sandworm]]), and the [[Muad'Dib (mouse)|kangaroo mouse]], known to the [[Fremen]] as "Muad'Dib." Some forms of flora existed on the planet, including the [[creosote bush]]. Various birds and bats existed in the ecosystems of the planet. Some of these were domesticated by the Fremen.

Specifically, the kinds of life forms that existed on Arrakis included the following:
* Poverty grass
* Ephemerals—chenopods, pigweeds, amarinth
* Scotch broom
* Low lupine
* Vine eucalyptus (from [[Caladan]])
* Dwarf tamarisk
* Shore pine
* Candelilla
* Suguaro
* Bis-naga
* Shrubs and bushes, including camel sage, onion grass, gobi feather grass, wild alfalfa, burrow bush, sand verbena, evening primrose, incense bush, smoke tree, and creosote bush
Various animals were part of the ecosystem, including the following:
* Burrowing animals, such as kit fox, kangaroo mouse, desert hare, and sand terrapin
* Predators, including the desert hawk, dwarf owl, eagle, and desert owl
* Arthropods, namely, [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], trapdoor spider, biting wasp, and wormfly
* The desert bat

==History==
Before the discovery of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] on the planet, Arrakis was of little tactical, biological, or geological interest to the inhabitants of the [[Old Empire|Old Empire.]] When Yansuph Ashkoko discovered it's geriatric effects however, it achieved a little more importance. After the Butlerian Jihad, the powerful effects of the [[Spice Melange|spice]], especially with regard to [[space travel]], quickly made it an essential resource and a focal point for the emerging [[Corrino Empire]]. The discovery of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] noticeably increased Arrakis's importance, until by the time of [[Paul Atreides]] it had become a critical component in the galaxy.

Previous experiments had seen sandworms die shortly after they were transplanted from Arrakis to another world, regardless of how faithful a reproduction of their ecosystem was made. As a result, while Arrakis was a fief of [[House Harkonnen]], the Corrinos sent their Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] to analyze the planet's ecosystem. Kynes' analysis of Arrakis convinced him that the planet was once a lush and fertile world. He believed that through careful and multigenerational planning, Arrakis could once again become a paradise. The Fremen, enchanted by Kynes's stories of large bodies of water, greenery, and mild temperatures not requiring [[stillsuit]]s, followed him with fervor. Kynes became so fascinated by the planet and its people that he married into a Fremen tribe, eventually being absorbed into their culture and coming to be known as a leader among the Fremen. He saw so much potential in the planet and its people that he sought to hide its secrets from the emperor. This practice led eventually to Kynes's death, but not before leaving a legacy and a vision for the Fremen people.

===[[Ascension of House Atreides]] and the [[God Emperor]]===

[[File:Dune_Messiah-Frank_Herbert_(1969)_First_edition-1.jpg|thumb]]

In 10,191 [[A.G.]], [[House Atreides]] arrived on Arrakis and took over control of the planet and spice production. By this time, the planet had for some years been under the brutal control of Atreides enemies [[House Harkonnen]], who managed spice mining operations on behalf of Padishah Emperor [[Shaddam IV]]. The Atreides rule was cut short, however, through a betrayal as part of a conspiracy between Harkonnen and Imperial forces.

House Atreides went into hiding, but after seeking refuge with the Fremen quickly became their leaders through their inherent ability to command loyalty and through their promise that Kynes's vision would be realized through their rule. Three years later, Paul Atreides, under the Fremen name of Muad'Dib, using Atreides family atomics, created a gap in the Shield Wall that had protected Arrakeen. Riding into the city on sandworms, the Fremen defeated Harkonnen and Corrino forces, and [[Paul Atreides]] declared victory and ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Arrakis became the new seat of power for both the Empire and the religious jihad that [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] unleashed upon the known universe.

Eventually, [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] limited interpretation of the [[Golden Path]] strategy led to the terraforming of the planet, carried out by Paul's son [[Leto Atreides II]], the long-lived [[God-Emperor]]. Over several thousand years, Arrakis was transformed into a green and temperate world much more habitable to humans, just as Kynes had hoped. Ultimately, however, the new ecology was dangerous to the giant sandworms, which nearly became extinct under Leto II's rule. During this time, new mountain ranges, forests, and rivers came into existence. Offworld animals were introduced and took root on the planet. Only Leto's [[Sareer]] remained evidence that Arrakis was once a desert planet.

After some 3,500 years of rule, Leto II died while crossing the [[Idaho River]] after the Guardian Wall of the Sareer opened. Leto fell into the river, and his worm-body was destroyed by the water, which was toxic to him. His body decomposed into sandtrout that absorbed water, eventually re-creating the conditions required for the sandworms to appear. Over the next 1,500 years, under the biological terraforming effect of the sandtrout/sandworm cycle, Arrakis gradually returned to being a desert. Also, over long millennia, many names for places had become shortened. Arrakis eventually became known as '''Rakis''', while the city of Arrakeen became known simply as '''Keen'''. After Leto's death, Leto's [[Fish Speakers]], the [[Rakian Priesthood]], and the [[Bene Gesserit]] took control of the planet.

===The Scattering===
Because most of humanity had gone out into [[The Scattering]], the return of the [[Honored Matres]] 1,500 years later caused the most fear about Rakis. The greater portion of humanity of the Scattering had been weaned of any need for melange, now able to safely perform foldspace journeys through the use of [[No-ships]] and [[Navigation machine]]s with no requirement for Spice-reliant Guild Navigators. The Matres in particular saw eliminating spice as a way to break the power brokers, the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood and the [[Tleilaxu]] (the only remaining users of Spice Melange), who had stayed behind in the Empire.

In an attempt to destroy the center of [[spice]] production, the Honored Matres eventually attacked the planet with their spaceborne incinerating [[Weapon, the|Weapon]], an action that destroyed all biological life and rendered parts of the planet's surface akin to fused glass. However, their efforts did not totally succeed, and the Bene Gesserit managed to escape with a ghola of Duncan Idaho; [[Sheeana]]; their leader, [[Darwi Odrade]]; and a single sandworm to [[Chapterhouse]]. The sandworm managed to survive the transplant and revived hopes in the Bene Gesserit to re-create Arrakis, or "Dune," on other planets through the [[Known Universe]].

Upon arriving at the secret Gesserit capital planet of Chapterhouse, Odrade had the worm drowned and had some of its sandtrout placed into the soil. Slowly, the world was terraformed into a planet similar to Dune, with a sandworm [[spice cycle]].

== Leitmotifs ==
Some of the [[Screen Adaptations|screen adaptations]] also use particular themes or leitmotifs to represent the planet Arrakis (Dune). The planet and its harsh environment tends to have its own distinct leitmotifs from the leitmotifs associated with the Fremen people or the sandworms.

==Trivia==
*The length of day and night on Arrakis at the poles were not explained clearly in the novels by [[Frank Herbert]].
*Little information of the pre-Imperium history of the planet was mentioned in the original novels by [[Frank Herbert]]. However, the prequel novels by his son [[Brian Herbert]] and coauthor [[Kevin J. Anderson]] stated that the existence of Arrakis was known to the [[Old Empire]].
*The name Arrakis is believed to have come from the [[wikipedia:Arabic language|Arabic]] name الراقص ''ar-rāqiṣ'', meaning "the dancer," originally a name for the star [[Wikipedia:Mu Draconis|Mu Draconis]].
*It may also be possible that the name Arrakis derives from the Arabic الرخيص ''ar-rakhīṣ'', meaning "the cheap one" or "the less worthy". Before the discovery of the spice melange, the planet was of no real value, making the name appropriate.
*Another possible source for the name Arrakis is the country of [[wikipedia:Iraq|Iraq]] (an Arabic name derived from the ancient [[wikipedia:Sumer|Sumerian]] city-state of [[wikipedia:Uruk|Uruk]]), which is known for its oil resources, and has been involved in [[wikipedia:Iraq War (disambiguation)|several major conflicts]] as a result.
*Arrakis appears to be largely based on the [[wikipedia:Arabian Peninsula|Arabian Peninsula]], including the desert environment, pseudo-[[wikipedia:Islam|Islamic]] religion, and tribal/nomadic [[wikipedia:Bedouin|Bedouin]] culture.

Thufir Hawat/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Thufir Hawat}}

[[File:Thufirhawat.png|thumb|Hawat, by Raúl Allén and Patricia Martin, Dune Graphic novel ]]

'''Thufir Hawat''' was a [[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] and [[Master of Assassins]] for [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] during the time of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto the Just]].

For three generations, Hawat had been responsible for Atreides House security. This meant protection for Atreides family members, anti-espionage, risk management, and various aspects of [[kanly]]. Moreover, Hawat had been entrusted with the training of the Ducal Heir [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]] in the arts of war, as well as political and military strategy.

Throughout the Imperium, Hawat had a formidable reputation. He was known in the [[Landsraad/XCD|Landsraad]] to be both cunning and honourable. Indeed, other Great Houses coveted him for his abilities as a strategist, warrior, and trusted advisor.

== The Move to Arrakis ==
When House Atreides was ordered to take over the planetary fief of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam IV]], Hawat had been one of the principal advisors for Duke Leto throughout the entire transition. While the Atreides were in the process of consolidating their rule over the planet, Hawat had been charged with the security of the royal compound in the city of Arrakeen, where the Atreides based their capital. During this time, Hawat saw his abilities and reputation tested when Harkonnen agents, left behind by the Baron Harkonnen, tried to assassinate Paul. However, despite Hawat offering his resignation, the Duke saw this only as a learning experience for the Mentat, advised Hawat to see it this way also, and kept him in his service.

Shortly after their arrival on Arrakis, the Duke ordered Hawat to command a raid on [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]], the Harkonnen homeworld, in order to destroy the (supposedly secret) [[spice melange/XD|spice]] hoards the Baron Harkonnen kept there. The raid was both daring and successful. It provided a morale boost of the Atreides army, which had been uncertain about its future after the move from their ancestral home of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], and it served to prepare the army for the looming war with [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]], which both Hawat and the Duke were certain would come swiftly. It also demonstrated the quality of Atreides military intelligence. Most importantly, it struck at the very heart of House Harkonnen, and served as further example to the Landsraad of Atreides courage and audacity. Perhaps most brilliant of all however, was that, much to the Baron's ire, House Harkonnen could not exact retribution because the Emperor had deemed such spice hoarding as highly illegal.

In part due to the destruction of Harkonnen spice stockpiles, Hawat knew the Harkonnens would not abandon the lucrative and exclusive spice mining operations on Arrakis. Moreover, Hawat also knew that both the Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor had eyed Duke Leto Atreides with envy because of his popularity in the Landsraad. Hawat surmised - quite rightly - that if the Harkonnens were to attack Arrakis, that [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]] would tacitly provide help, most likely in the form of Imperial [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] legions, disguised in Harkonnen uniforms. Unfortunately, despite having made such an accurate analysis, as he would soon discover, Hawat had seriously underestimated how many troops the Emperor would send; Hawat's estimation was that the Emperor would send a maximum of two brigades of Sardaukar to aid the Harkonnens. The Emperor sent fifty.

A constantly suspicious man, but one who loved the Atreides, Hawat was hyper-vigilant in his protection of Atreides family members. Unfortunately, though he knew that there was a traitor in the Atreides household, Hawat mistakenly believed it to be the [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]]. Even after the successful Harkonnen/Corrino attack on Arrakis, which saw House Atreides defeated, Hawat still believed that Jessica had been the one who betrayed them, instead of [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Dr. Wellington Yueh]]. This was in no small part due to the Baron Harkonnen feeding Hawat false information.

It was during the attack when Hawat had come to discover the true abilities of the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]]. At one stage, Hawat and approximately twenty Atreides troops under his command were holed up in a cave while retreating from the Harkonnen/Sardaukar advance. Through a bond he had formed with a Fremen warrior, Hawat came to observe a skirmish between a dozen Fremen and a few Sardaukar where, after the dust had settled, only the Fremen remained standing. Moreover, Hawat also observed that a [[troop carrier]] filled with approximately 300 Sardaukar soldiers was destroyed, killing all 300 soldiers, when a Fremen flying an [[ornithopter]] made a kamikaze run at the carrier. It was through these actions that Hawat came to realise - belatedly - that the Fremen were a formidable force that could have been a powerful ally for his Duke.

== In Harkonnen Service ==
After the Harkonnens replaced House Atreides as rulers of Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen took Thufir Hawat prisoner and forced him into his service. This was done by introducing a poison into Hawat's blood, for which only the Harkonnens maintained the antidote. Baron Harkonnen saw this as a personal victory, because of Hawat's reputation, because Hawat had foiled many of the Baron's plans against the Atreides, and because the Baron's own Mentat, [[Piter de Vries/XD|Piter de Vries]], had been killed by Duke Leto just before he died.

While in the service of the Harkonnens, Hawat used his considerable talents to manipulate the Harkonnens to some degree, through political manoeuvring and assassination. Hawat had attempted to create a rift between the Baron and his nephew, [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen/XD|Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]], by using a captive Atreides warrior as a means to kill Feyd in the [[gladiator]] ring. While Hawat knew the plan would ultimately fail because of the unfair advantage Feyd would give himself, the warrior had almost succeeded. Instead of facing a drugged slave, Hawat arranged for Feyd to confront a trained Atreides soldier with his capacities fully intact. As a result, the Baron's game trainer was executed for putting Feyd in danger, which left the position vacant to be filled by one of Feyd's men.

For approximately two years Hawat remained in the service of the Harkonnens, plotting and scheming in subtle ways, ultimately hoping to seek revenge against those who killed his "beloved Duke", as well as against whom he believed to be the Traitor, the Lady Jessica. Moreover, Hawat took the defeat of the Atreides as a personal failure, and therefore believed that if he continued to scheme and manipulate inside the Harkonnen House, as well as exact revenge against the traitor, he may be able to redeem himself in some way. Indeed, Hawat very nearly brought down the Harkonnens from within, playing the ambitions of the [[na-Baron]] Feyd-Rautha against his uncle. These schemes underscored the deadly cunning of Hawat, who had clearly earned his legendary reputation as a formidable political and military operative.

== Hawat's Death ==
In 10,193 Leto's son Paul managed to restore House Atreides to power over Arrakis and ultimately wrested the [[Golden Lion Throne/XD|Golden Lion Throne]] from the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrinos]]. Upon discovering that Hawat had been unknowingly working against Paul under the service of Baron Harkonnen, Hawat committed suicide. He felled himself on a poison needle hidden in his left hand meant for Paul. Paul had offered him his own life for all of Hawat's serivce to House Atreides. Hawat, rather than kill the son of his beloved Duke, gave his life for the Atreides one last time.
For two years Hawat had been working for the Harkonnens, helping them fight a Fremen leader named [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]] who had lead an insurgency on Arrakis, only to realise that Muad'Dib was Paul himself, son of his beloved Duke. At that point, the great Thufir Hawat passed on to legend.

== Behind the Scenes ==
Thufir Hawat was portrayed by actor Freddie Jones in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 Dune movie]]. His death scene was filmed, but deleted from the final cut of the film. Jan Vlasák played Thufir Hawat in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 Dune miniseries]].

Chani Kynes/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Chani Kynes}}


[[File:Chanikynes.png|thumb|Chani, by Raúl Allén and Patricia Martin, Dune Graphic novel ]]



'''Chani Kynes''', also known as '''Chanisihayah''', (10,178-10,209) was the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] bound concubine of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], and the mother of his three children: [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], and the twins [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]].

== Upbringing ==
Chani was born on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], the daughter of the half-Fremen planetologist [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]] and his full-Fremen wife [[Faroula]]. She gradually developed into a formidable fighter, and by the time of her father's death was serving under [[naib]] [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]].

== Introduction to Paul ==
When Paul and his mother [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica]] escaped from [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]] after the invasion of [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] they quickly found themselves in the deep desert of Arrakis. There, while running from a [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]] they took refuge in a hidden basin in the rocks, and were intercepted by a group of traveling Fremen, which included Chani.

Her introduction to Paul came during a tense stand-off. Chani was familiar to the Atreides heir because of her appearance in his prescient visions prior to his arrival on Arrakis. But to her Paul was initially a stranger.

== Life with Paul ==
After the integration of Paul and Jessica into the Fremen by Stilgar, Chani began her long-lasting love affair with the young Duke, and eventually bore him a son, [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|Leto]]. However, their first born was murdered by an Imperial raiding party while Paul was leading the attack on the Imperial landing party.

After the defeat of House Harkonnen and [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]] on Arrakis, and Paul's subsequent ascent to Emperor and marriage to [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]], Chani became his official concubine and remained his exclusive partner.

== Life with Muad'Dib ==
Chani remained Paul's emotional rock during the establishment of his rule, and during the first two assassination attempts on his life. She applauded Paul's quick giving over of [[Swordmaster/XD|Swordmaster]] [[Whitmore Bludd]] to the blood-thirsty Fremen mob, after Bludd's failed attempt on the [[Emperor/XD|Emperor]]'s life during the [[Great Surrender]] Ceremony. Later, Chani marveled at Paul's sparing of both [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] and [[Lady]] [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]]'s life, after Hasimir had stabbed Paul deeply with the [[Emperor's Blade]].

== Pregnancy and Death ==
[[Image:Chani-and-Irulan.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Chani (left, played by Barbora Kodetová) threatens Irulan (played by Julie Cox) in the ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'' miniseries.]]
Seven years later, when Chani became pregnant once again, Irulan sought to usurp her and become the bearer of Paul's children. She found support with the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]], who feared the impact of Chani's largely-unknown bloodline on their breeding program.

However, Irulan's attempts to terminate Chani's pregnancy through drugs failed. After a traumatic pregnancy (as it was accelerated by Spice, taking only five months instead of nine) Chani gave birth to twins, who Paul named [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].

Irulan's treachery did, however, bring a secondary result. Chani died shortly after giving birth to the twins, due to complications stemming from the drugs Paul's titular wife had been surreptitiously feeding her.

The [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]] [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]] offered immediately to resurrect Chani in an [[Axlotl Tanks|Axlotl Tank]]. Yet despite the temptation, Paul refused, knowing the impact such an event would have on the [[The Golden Path/XD|Golden Path]].

== As a Ghola Re-Born ==
Chani made a re-appearance over 5000 years later, during the time of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]]—the great struggle at the end of the age. Chani was reborn as a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] aboard the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]] ''[[Ithaca]]'', as the Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]] desired to have as many possible strong characters from human-kind's past, in the great fight against the unknown [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]] that was pursuing them.

Chani was resurrected, as well as her husband Paul Atreides, her mother-in-law Jessica Atreides, her father Liet Kynes, and her son Leto Atreides II. As she and Paul matured, she served primarily as a helper and strengthener, as it believed that Paul would face an upcoming great challenge when the ship would be inevitably captured. This belief was reinforced as Paul kept having the same prescient vision over and over—of him bleeding from a deep [[knife]] wound, as he himself looked down upon his bleeding body.

== Kralizec on Synchrony ==
When Chani was in her late teens aboard the ship, the Ithaca was ensnared by the Enemy, who was revealed to be [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], of the reborn [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] Empire. The ship was brought to [[Synchrony]], and the leaders of the crew, including Chani, were brought to heart of the flow-metal machine world, the [[Cathedral]].

Omnius and Erasmus then arranged a forced duel between Paul versus a [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]]-raised clone of himself, named [[Paolo]]. Omnius strongly believed that the victor would emerge as the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]]. Paul lost the duel, and his vision was fulfilled, as he slowly bled to near death.

As Paolo, after over-dosing on the enhanced [[melange/XD|melange]] [[ultraspice]], starved and thirsted to death on one side of Cathedral, Paul fought for his life on the other. As Chani cried over the body of Paul, and encouraged her loved one to stay alive, Jessica was able to tell Paul to mend his body on the cellular level, as he was akin to a full Reverend Mother. Paul succeeded in mending his body and bringing his life fluids back into his vital organs.

The events of Kralizec played themselves out over the next few hours—the banishment of Omnius by the [[Oracle of Time]]; the galaxy wide killing of the [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s by Erasmus; the releasing of the ''Ithaca'''s sandworms onto Synchrony and their subsequent destruction of the city; the ending of the war between mankind and the machines; and the revelation of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] as the ultimate super-being, with Erasmus dying and making Idaho the new [[Evermind]].

As Chani and Paul both had their full memories back, both were relieved that Paul was not the ultimate Kwisatz, and that the great burden of being such, would fall upon Duncan. They would be allowed to live lives of near obscurity. As the years passed, Chani and Paul decided to round out their relationship as husband and wife in happiness, and re-explored the now reborn planet Arrakis, and the galaxy, together.

Fremen/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Fremen}}{{Cleanup}}{{Stub}}[[Image:Fremen (1984 Dune film).jpg|thumb|right|Fremen in stilsuits, from the 1984 Dune movie.]]

The '''Fremen''', originally known as the '''Free Men of Arrakis''' or '''Free Men of Dune''' and later the '''Freemen of Dune''', were a sub-culture of [[human]]s descended from the [[Zensunni Wanderers]] who considered the planet [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] their home. They formed an integral part in the establishment of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] launched by [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], their adopted leader.

== History ==

[[File:Dune-ccg-judge-of-the-change-fakhir-zirut-56s_519rFydJQTL-1.jpg|thumb]]

The origins of the Fremen lay with the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], who fled from one planet to another prior to The [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]], escaping religious and cultural persecution. Several [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] settled on Arrakis, as they fled from the upcoming war initiated by the [[Titans]]. They thought, this were [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]], the final war in their scriptures and mankind was doomed to lose it. These Zensunni mainly made a living by scavenging the desert for anything that could be sold to the merchants at the spaceport. The worms were considered demons.

Several decades before the war between [[Omnius]] and the [[League of Nobles]] again broke out, with the [[Battle of Zimia|attack]] on [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]], one [[Selim]] was banned from his [[Sietch]], though he was innocent, for a horrible of crime of the stealing of water. From now on, he despised the way of living of the Zensunni. By mistake, he learned to ride a worm and by luck, he found an Old Empire biological research station in the deep desert, that provided him with water. He became Selim Wormrider. He no longer considered the worms as demons, but more as some sort of [[Shai-hulud]], unwilling god. He gathered followers, who also preferred a more spiritually and ascetic life like Selim.

During the war Omnius vs League, a group of [[zensunni/XD|zensunni]] slaves fled [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]] in an [[Spacefolder|experimental spaceship]] and they crashed landed on Arrakis. After an arduous year where nearly half of the original escapees, they mixed with Selim's followers and the leader of the slaves, [[Ishmael]], declared themselves the [[Free Men of Dune|F''ree Men of Arrakis'']]. Later, this was shortended to ''[[Freemen of Dune]]'' in a schism of Free Men which resulted in Ishmael's followers going into the deep desert and others merging with the townfolk of the north pole, leaving their Free Men roots. The ''Freemen'' ultimately became known as ''Fremen''. Despite their keen sense of oral history, the history of the Fremen prior to their arrival on Arrakis was distorted and partially lost over the millennia. They concluded that Arrakis was the final stop on the migration of the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], a journey that they mistakenly believed started on the planet [[Poritrin]].

In [[10191 AG]], Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] ordered [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] to replace their enemies [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] in the administration of Arrakis. Upon arrival on Arrakis, House Atreides, lead by Duke [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto I]] sought to befriend the Fremen. However, because of years of harsh Harkonnen rule and dealings with Imperial agents, the Fremen were at first distrustful of the Atreides.

After a short while however, the Fremen came to develop a relationship with the Duke through his even-handedness and generosity. Moreover, the Duke sent his [[Warmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] as an advance ambassador, and through Duncan's abilities as a warrior the Atreides managed to ellicit the trust of the Fremen, and the Duke quickly learned that the Fremen were a powerful force with which to align his House. However, when the Harkonnens and Corrinos invaded Arrakis, House Atreides went renegade and sought refuge with the Fremen.

After their adoption of the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the Fremen saw a rapid and dramatic change in their fortunes. Upon determining that Paul Atreides was their [[Mahdi]] - or prophetic savior - they readily followed his leadership and engaged in guerilla warfare against the [[Imperium/XD|Imperial]] elements on Arrakis. The Fremen had developed such formidable fighting abilities through years of harsh environment and attrition wars against Harkonnens, that they were deemed superior to even the Corrino [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] forces. Within a few years they had gone from being perpetually harassed by elements within the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino Empire]] (most notably House Harkonnen) to being the foot soldiers of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's powerful Jihad]]. In twelve Standard Years, the Fremen overran the Imperium.

===Museum Fremen===

From the time of the [[God-Emperor]] onwards the cultural impact of the Fremen ebbed and flowed, thanks in no small part to the terraforming of Arrakis. By the time of the God Emperor's death, the Fremen were relegated to being no more than 'museum' pieces, their ancient and purposeful traditions diluted into honorary forms without meaning.

After [[Scattering/XD|The Scattering]] and during the time of the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]], the Fremen possessed little of the distinct identity of their past, although a few individuals, such as [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]], continued to adhere to some of the old Fremen attitudes and traditions.

It is believed that most, if not all of the Fremen (excluding Sheanna) were killed during the Honored Matre attack on Rakis that essentially destroyed the planet, approximately 1500 Standard Years after Leto II's death.

== Culture ==

[[File:51wVoLA4wqL-1.jpg|thumb]]

To the native Fremen, the fight for survival had long dominated their cultural identity. The brutal environment of Arrakis, necessitated the frugal use energy and resources, especially water. Additionally, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of [[Arrakis]] to fend off off-world opponents who often possess far superior technology and formal training.

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal collectives, known as [[sietch]]es, which were led by a [[Naib]]. Each sietch resides within one of the numerous rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood.

Water played a vital role in the Fremen culture.  Indeed, for Fremen, water ''was'' life.  To conserve against the unnecessary loss of water in the desert, Fremen wore a complex full-body filtration system called [[stillsuit]]s, which reclaimed the body's moisture.  Additionally, specialized headgear prevented most of the normal loss through the scalp and forehead via perspiration, while masks and noseplugs reclaimed moisture from the wearers' breathing.  Gloves were also available, too, but many Fremen opted instead to rub the juice of the [[creosote bush]] on their hands to inhibit perspiration.  With a Fremen stillsuit in proper working order, the wearer lost only about a thimbleful of water per day.

[[File:Fremenduel.jpg|thumb]]

The Fremen rule was that one's water belongs to the tribe.  Thus when a Fremen died or was killed in combat, rather than being buried or cremated, he or she was rendered down into water. In the case of ''[[amtal]]'', or ritual combat to the death between two disagreeing Fremen, since they fought without stillsuits, the water of the loser went to the victor to replenish him.  What remained was measured and allocated to him, but the water itself was turned over to the watermasters.

== Appearance ==
Due to living on Arrakis, the typical Fremen appeared as a sinewy [[human]] with leathery tanned skin. These effects were less pronounced on those Fremen who live in cities such as [[Arrakeen/XD|Arrakeen]]. In addition, Fremen eyes were colored entirely blue, due to their excessive ingestion of the [[Spice Melange/XD|spice melange]].

== Religion ==

[[File:Ramallo.jpg|thumb]]

Religiously, the Fremen were deeply spiritual, to the point of being superstitious. Over the centuries they had adapted their blend of Zensunni faith to their desert environment, and adopted the [[Sandworm/XD|Sandworm]] of Arrakis (or [[Shai-Hulud]] as they called it) as a physical manifestation of God. This, combined with the sparse natural resources on Arrakis led to the Spice Melange becoming an integral part of their diet and culture.

As with many traditionalist and mystic religions, the faith of the Fremen relied heavily on prophecies. These beliefs were used by some, including the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] to further their own ends.

== Behind the scenes ==

* Though further details are not chronicled by [[Frank Herbert]], the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] give a detailed explanation of how the Fremen came into being. In these novels they are an amalgamation of at least two separate groups:  the Zenshi'a, who came during the rise of the Evermind or possibly during the Time of the Titans, and the Zensunni, who arrived during Butlerian Jihad after events on Poritrin led to the second slave uprising. Both fled to Arrakis to escape slavery brought on by the harsh reaction of the free humans to the Buddaislamics refusal to fight the thinking machines as they further encroached on humanity.

Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)}}

[[File:Paul Muad'Dib Calling His First Sandworm (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb]]{{Quote|The hawk and the mouse are the same!|[[Warrick]]|Dune: House Harkonnen}}
'''Muad'Dib''' was the name adopted by [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] after he was accepted by the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] as one of their own.

== Symbolism ==

The symbolic definition is broader in complexity.

It was part the chosen name of manhood that Paul selected when he was accepted into the Fremen. It was one of two names that Paul maintained within the tribe.  [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] explained that the first, Usul, meant "strength of the base of the pillar". That was his secret name, his troop name, that only Sietch Tabr could use and none other may presume.

The second name, Muad'Dib, is that by which Paul was known openly. Paul's choice of the name pleased and impressed Stilgar, and other Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]].

{{quote|Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib.|Stilgar|Dune}}.

Although the English pronunciation of this word calls for a long "i", there is an almost exact word in Arabic like it (Mu'adib), which means "private tutor" or "teacher". It used to be that the Caliphs, the rulers of the Muslim world, would hire a Mu'adib to teach their children. The practice seemed to be common for other strata of society as well. 

== Paul-Muad'Dib ==

Paul was reluctant to throw away his [[House Atreides/XD|full past]] and get rid of the full name his [[Leto Atreides I/XD|father]] gave him, which is why he first wished to be called Paul-Muad'Dib.  Unfortunately, this name was soon forgotten and became simply "Muad'dib". Also, it was hoped that by keeping the name his father gave him, he could prevent the mass slaughter that would occur later in his name. Sadly, he could not.

The meanings of both Usul and Muad'Dib have powerful ramifications and foreshadowing for the purpose Paul has on Arrakis.

After escaping the successful invasion of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harokonnen]], and proving their value to the Fremen, Paul and his mother [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], were accepted into [[Sietch Tabr]] by the [[Naib]], Stilgar.

Paul was instructed to take a Fremen word as his new name. While lost in the deep desert prior to being intercepted by Stilgar and his clan, Paul had spotted a small but nimble creature foraging on a rock outcrop. The creature had been a [[desert mouse]]. Upon asking the name of the creature, and being told it was called ''"Muad'Dib"'' by the [[Fremen/XD|native Fremen]], he chose it as his new name.

His choice in name was also marginally influenced by the prescient visions he had begun to have after arriving on [[Dune/XD|Dune]]. In one recurring vision he saw throngs of Fremen chanting the word ''"Muad'Dib"'' at him in a subservient manner.

Castle Caladan/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Castle Caladan}}


[[File:Dune_44-1.jpg|frame|Castle Caladan as depicted in the 1984 Dune Movie]]

'''Castle Caladan''' was the official residence of the ruling clan of planet [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. 

===Description===

It was an ancient structure, made of very old stone and wood, and was characterised by many rooms and halls, as well as vaulted ceilings with patterned wooden beams. On the [[Western Continent]] of the planet, it stood by a great river and farmland owned by [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. Various rooms within the castle held views of river orchards, [[Cala City]], and [[Mount Syubi]].

==History==
===House Atreides===
Its Dining Hall was the scene of many lush meals presided over by the Atreides [[Duke]], and was the home of [[House Atreides]] for twenty-six generations, until the Atreides, under the rule of [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Duke Leto the Just]], the 20th Atreides Duke, were ordered to take over the planetary [[fief]] of [[Arrakis]] in [[10191 AG]]. Presumably, after [[Jessica Atreides/XD|The Lady Jessica]] returned to Caladan after her son [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]] ascended to the Imperial Throne, she resided in Castle Caladan with [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]].

===During the Time of Kralizec===
Five thousand years after the [[Ascension of House Atreides/XD|Ascension of House Atreides]], and after the Atreides family had permanently left Caladan; the castle, which had fallen into ruins, was re-built by the [[Enhanced Face Dancer]] leader, [[Khrone]].

Khrone used the Castle as his headquarters to produce his back-up Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]] project, a clone of Paul Atreides, named [[Paolo]], whom he had trained by a [[ghola/XD|ghola]] of the [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]]. Khrone had the Castle re-created as close to the original as possible, to produce the correct memories of the desire for revenge in Harkonnen; and genuine memories in Paolo. 

As Paolo was raised by Vladimir into his second decade, Harkonnen ensured that Paolo was the opposite of the original Paul Atreides; by crafting Paolo's personality as arrogant, betraying, and paranoid. The Castle was near-abandoned by Khrone when Harkonnen and Paolo were permanently summoned away from Caladan, to have Paolo's training completed by the [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] rulers, [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]].

===After the Day of Kralizec===
After the death of Khrone, the [[kill switch|mass killing]] of all Face Dancers by Erasmus, and the bright future of man/machine cooperation under the duidance of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], Castle Caladan was again occupied. A ghola of Jessica Atreides, with her friend companion Dr [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Welling Yueh]], made the Castle their home, as Jessica awaited the birth of the ghola of her former husband, Leto I.

Arrakeen/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Arrakeen}}

[[File:Dune-05.jpg|thumb]]

'''Arrakeen''', later known as '''Onn''' and then '''Keen''', was one of the largest cities on the desert planet [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], and its seat of power.

<br />

==History==

For thousands of years, Arrakeen had been a relatively primitive settlement built on the Shield Wall, southeast of [[Carthag/XD|Carthag]].

Prior to the arrival of the [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides]] on Arrakis, the Emperor's right-hand man Count [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] and his wife [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot]] had resided in the palace. [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto I]] had chosen Arrakeen for his seat of government because it was small, easier to sterilize and defend.

Arrakeen would go through multiple transformations over time; it first becomes an Imperial capital of staggering proportions under [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Paul Muad'Dib]]. It is later transformed into a festival city known as Onn, explicitly for the worship of the God-Emperor [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]]. Finally, in the centuries after his death, it is known as Keen, a modern (though still impressive) city to house the [[Rakian Priesthood|Priesthood of Rakis]].

During the time of the [[Faufreluches]], the city was where the ruling family maintained its household. After the death of Leto II, the city fell under the control of the Priesthood whose deity was the [[God-Emperor]]. Even though the Imperium was no more, the city remained an important political centre, due to its concentration of those who worshipped the God-Emperor, as well as acting as the administration centre for [[Spice Melange/XD|spice]] mining operations. The [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]], the [[Fish Speaker/XD|Fish Speakers]], and other groups maintained a presence there in various forms.

When the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] attacked and destroyed Rakis with their super-weapon [[Obliterator]]s, Keen was buried under a mountain of slag. Over two decades later, a [[CHOAM/XD|CHOAM]] expedition to salvage some of the artifacts from the buried Priesthood complex yielded few rewards, although [[Guriff]] and his scavengers stayed behind to keep searching.

After the revelation of the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]] after the Day of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]], the [[ghola/XD|ghola]]s of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]], and his wife, [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]] returned to the area around Keen. Under the guidance of the super-being/[[Evermind]] Idaho, Arrakeen and Rakis was being returned to its pre-Obliterator state of existence.
==Description==
It was located near the northern pole of the planet, and sat largely on a mass of bedrock. This, in conjunction with the protection afforded by the [[Shield Wall/XD|Shield Wall]], prevented any incursions from [[Sandworm/XD|sandworms]].

Aside from providing the governing influence with a base of operations, the chief activities in Arrakeen were trade with off-world groups and individuals, and as a gathering point for some [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] who preferred a more 'cultured' or exotic life.

During the time of the [[Lost Ones]] were returning from [[Scattering/XD|The Scattering]], the city's name had become shortened to Keen.

Ascension of House Atreides/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Ascension of House Atreides}}

[[File:Dune210106-11.jpeg|thumb|Ascension of Paul Atreides]]

The '''Ascension of House Atreides''' can be traced to the marriage of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] to [[Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]] after the Fremen defeat of the Sardaukar on the [[Plains of Arrakeen]]. 

===House Corrino & House Harkonnen===
Irulan Corrino was the eldest daughter of [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]], who had been utterly defeated in the [[Arrakis Revolt]]. Other rival claims to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] were either destroyed with [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]], joined the new [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Emperor]] Paul, or their animosity did not surface until later. Powerful [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]], who had been allied with [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]], was destroyed concurrently on the desert world.

===House Thorvald===
[[House Thorvald]]'s rebellion against Paul [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]] began in [[10194/XD|10,194 AG]], with Paul's speech before the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] after the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] sack of [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]]. As Paul spoke to the nobles, [[Earl]] [[Memnon Thorvald]] shouted demonstratives at Paul, as he marched out of the Assembly Area. Thorvald scored some minor victories, but [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's Jihad]] marched inexorably forward. Four years later, when Thorvald planned to detroy the populace of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]], and take [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica]] hosatge; Paul ordered Thorvald's homeworld of [[Ipyr]] sterilized.

===House Vernius===
Another powerful [[House/XD|House]], [[House Vernius]] of [[Ix/XD|Ix]], was embittered towards House Atreides, but led by under-siege noble, [[Bronso of Ix/XD|Bronso of Ix]]; whose animosity towards Paul's rule did not openly surface until the early 10,200s. [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]], as [[Regent]], captured Bronso, and had him executed in [[10201 AG/XD|10,201 AG]].

===Leto II===
Even with the first Corrino threat of Shaddam's [[ghola/XD|ghola]] army, which attacked openly during Alia's Regency; and the second threat under [[Wensicia Corrino/XD|Wensicia Corrino]] against Paul's newborn children, [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], the Atreides survived, and Leto II became Emperor. From that time through the death of Leto II, approximately 3,500 years later, [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides Empire]] dominated the [[Known Universe/XD|Known Universe]].

Burbage
{{expanded}}

[[File:197798-1.jpg|thumb|Atreides officers - Dune miniseries]]

'''Burbage''' was an [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides]] general who participated in the events before and after the [[Ascension of House Atreides/XD|Ascension of House Atreides to the Imperial Throne]].

===During the War of Assassins of 10,187 AG===

During the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG|War of Assassins of 10,078 A.G.]], Burbage was among the troops of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] and [[House Ecaz]] during the siege of [[Ritka]], capital of [[Grumman]], [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]]'s homeworld. During the stallion charge made by the Moritani troops against the Atreides-Ecazi besiegers, Burbage suffered an injury, which later resulted in the scar on his face.

===Attack on Jericha===

After the [[Arrakis Revolt]] and the [[Ascension of House Atreides/XD|Ascension of House Atreides]], [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] sent Burbage in command of a [[Caladan/XD|Caladanian]] platoon to the temperate planet [[Jericha]], a base of the rebel [[Earl]] [[Memnon Thorvald]]. The [[Fremen Jihad|Jihadi army]] commanded by [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] (where Burbage and his platoon were included), lost most of their aircraft due to [[House Thorvald]]'s [[Suspensor-nullification effect|Suspensor-nullification equipment]]. Both commanders of the Imperial troops had to use [[Ruh-yak]]s to launch attacks and transport their equipment. While crossing a river stream on the side of a Jericha mountain, Stilgar fell into the water, and almost drowned. However, Burbage personally pulled him from water and saved his life. This near-death experience made Stillgar take the decision of returning to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] and serve as the planetary governor, as well as [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]]'s principal advisor.

After Stilgar's retreat, Burbage took command of both Caladanian and [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] [[Fremen Jihad|Jihadi troops]], and continued the war against [[Memnon Thorvald|Earl Thorvald]] at Jericha. Finally, the rebel Earl was forced to retire from Jericha after his forces were routed by Burbage' troops.

Ecazi Revolt
{{Expanded}}
The '''Ecazi Revolt''', also known as the '''Ecazi Rebellion''' or '''Rebellion on Ecaz''', was a rebellion on the planet [[Ecaz/XD|Ecaz]], ''"the sculptor's paradise"'', against the ruling [[House Ecaz]], which took place in [[10140 AG]].

===Origins===
After the disappearance of [[Empress Consort]] [[Alexandra Ecaz]] in the year [[10098 AG]], [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] [[Elrood IX/XD|Elrood IX]] decided to marry a woman from planet [[Hassika V]], [[Habla]]. His impulsive marriage was condemned by several members in the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]], and it resulted in a general rebellion from part of the Ecazis, perhaps because they remembered that Habla's predecessor as Empress had mysteriously vanished, and also because Alexandra Ecaz belonged to the [[House Ecaz]], sovereigns of Ecaz.

The Ecazi revolt brought chaos in the Landsraad, as many nobles dissaproved Elrood's marriage, and things started to go worse for the Emperor when he realized that his [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] legions weren't enough to destroy the rebels, causing more panic in the Landsraad council.
===Fall of Ferdinand Ecaz===
[[Archduke]] [[Ferdinand Ecaz]], sovereign of Ecaz, was expelled from the [[Mahagony Throne]] by the Ecazi rebels, who used the planet as their principal headquarter.
===Atreides-Vernius reinforcements===
Seeing that his Sardaukar could not manage to defeat the rebels, the Emperor was forced to ask for military help to the [[Great Houses]] of the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]], and only two noblemen answered his call: [[Earl]] [[Dominic Vernius]] from [[Ix/XD|Ix]], and [[Duke]] [[Paulus Atreides]] from [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. Both Vernius and Atreides sent their armies to Ecaz, and, along with the Sardaukar legions (among them was the [[Supreme Bashar/XD|Supreme Bashar]] [[Zum Garon]]) in order to suppress the rebellion.
===Last battle===
Both Paulus Atreides and Dominic Vernius commanded their own armies in the first battle line. Both noblemen fought bravely and, thanks to them, the Imperial forces prevailed over the Ecazi rebels, and the Emperor could force his subjects to recognize his marriage with Habla. [[House Ecaz]] was restored on the planet, and Archduke Ferdinand was restored in the Mahagony Throne, giving an end to the rebellion.
===Aftermath===
After the Ecazi Revolt was suppressed, [[Elrood IX/XD|Emperor Elrood IX]] appreciated the loyalty of both Paulus Atreides and Dominic Vernius. The Atreides Duke was married to Elrood IX's granddaughter, [[Helena Richese]], and obtained through her a chair in the [[CHOAM]]. Dominic Vernius was rewarded by the Emperor with the possession of several planets in the [[Alkaroups system]]. The failure of the Ecazi Revolt initiated a time of feasts and Imperial festivals in the magnificent [[Imperial Opal Palace|Imperial Court]] on planet [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], where both Dominic Vernius and Paulus Atreides were honored by Elrood, and the reputation of their [[Houses]] increased considerably.

It was during these festivals that the young Earl Vernius met the Imperial concubine [[Shando Balut]] with whom he fell in love. Their secret affair could not be for ever, so Shando requested the Emperor to leave the harem, and he gave her his permission, but, as soon as Shando left Kaitain, she married Dominic Vernius on [[Vernii]], Capital of Ix, Vernius' homeworld. Elrood's rage at such event made him hate Dominic, and so, [[House Vernius]].

'''Paulus Atreides''' aka the''' ''Old Duke '''''(10089-[[10154 AG/XD|10154 AG]]), was the son of [[Kean Atreides]], grandson of [[Miklos Atreides]], and the 25th Duke Atreides. Paulus married [[Helena Richese]], and fathered a single son, [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]]. Paulus posthumously became the grandfather to [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] (who was named in his honor), and great-grandfather to [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] (the [[God-Emperor]]) and [[Ghanima/XD|Ghanima Atreides]]. Duke Paulus regularly engaged in bullfights, until he lost his life to a drugged Salusan bull.

==Life==
Around age 15, he survived for months on the battlefield with only the few possessions in a pack on his back.

He married [[Helena Richese]], and her [[House Richese|house]] regained some of its lost prestige. Initially he admitted he was in love with her but subsequently this changed, and had other mistresses and perhaps even illegitimate children. During the [[Ecazi Revolt]] Paulus and [[Dominic Vernius]] fought on Elrood IX’s side against the rebels.

The Duke was an honorable man, well respected by the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] and beloved by his people; he was not very formal and developed strong bonds with the common people of Caladan, quite unlike his wife who maintained contacts with other powerful [[Houses]]. He used to sleep during the yearly audition of the [[Agamemnon tragedy]].

Paulus educated Leto with methods which Helena disagreed; he make him worked with villagers (had spent a month working in the [[pundi rice]] fields) and socialized with citizens and commoners.

The Old Duke was known to be a great leader of his people, and a showman who had a flair for diplomacy, daring, and the dramatic. In a classic example of these qualities, the Old Duke announced a bullfighting spectacle in honor of the departure of his son for [[Ix/XD|Ix]], where he would fight himself.

Preparing for this spectacle, [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]] had suggested that the stablemaster [[Yresk]] slightly tranquilize the bull, but the Duke denied, wanting to face a real challenge. He also used only a half [[shield]] to guard his side. Although he hadn't perform for a year, he fought for an hour and killed the bull, to the admiration of the crowd. However, he was killed by a [[Salusan Bull]] in the bullring of the [[Plaza de Toros]].

Leto later discovered his mother was involved in the drug of the animal, so he exiled her to Caladan's [[Eastern Continent]], to live in solitude in the [[Abbey]] of the [[Sisters in Isolation]] .[[File:Paulus atreides and a salusan bull.jpg|thumb|Death of the Old Duke by a drugged salusan bull.
(source: http://dreamsofshaihulud.tumblr.com/)]]

==Legacy==
The bull was subsequently killed, and its head was mounted on the wall in the Dining Hall of [[Castle Caladan]], (and later the [[Keep]] at [[Arrakeen]]), replete with the Old Duke's blood stains.

Although Paul Atreides was considered - and indeed considered himself - to be much like his father, it was said that Paul in actual fact more resembled the Old Duke in the manner in which he conducted himself. [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], and Duke Leto I, had all observed how Paul's leadership style, certain movements he made, or phrases uttered by him were reminiscent of the Old Duke.

Thufir Hawat, the [[Mentat]] [[Master of Assassins]], was brought into the employ of House Atreides by The Old Duke, where he remained a loyal servant for three successive generations. This could be seen as testament to The Old Duke's ability to inspire loyalty in his men, a classic Atreides trait.

Another testament to the Old Duke's compassion was his act of&nbsp;taking the young Duncan Idaho into his home; an act which the latter did not soon forget. After becoming a [[Sword Master]] of the Ginaz, Idaho would proudly wield the Old [[Duke's sword]].

==Quotes==
*The populace must think their ruler is a greater man than they, else why should they follow him? Above all a leader must be a showman, giving his people the bread and circuses they require.

== Behind the Scenes ==
There are scant references to the nineteenth Atreides Duke in Frank Herbert's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. These references involve mainly how he died, the bull's head, and essences of the man seen by others in Paul. In this book, he is only referred to as "The [[Old Duke]]". The name of '''Paulus Atreides''' and a history of the man were detailed in the [[Prelude to Dune]] prequel books.

''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'' outlines that The Old Duke was named [[Minotauros Atreides]] and outlines a detailed account of his life, including his upbringing, schooling, how he ascended to the Duchy, and how he came to sire Leto.

Jessica Atreides/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Jessica Atreides}}
[[Image:Jessica.jpg|right|thumb|The Lady Jessica, bound concubine of the Duke Leto Atreides, played by [[Francesca Annis]]]] '''Lady Jessica of the Atreides''' ([[10154 AG]]<ref name=time>Timeline</ref>-[[10256 AG]]) was the official concubine of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/DE|Leto Atreides I]], and the mother of his son Emperor [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]]. She was also a [[Reverend Mother/DE|Reverend Mother]] of the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.

== Biography== 

===Upbringing=== 

A result of the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Jessica was the illegitimate daughter of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]]<ref name=jessica>Atreides-Harkonnen, Lady Jessica</ref> and an unknown mother. The Bene Gesserit breeding charts note that Jessica's birth mother was named [[Tanidia Nerus/DE|Tanidia Nerus]]. She was raised from birth by the Bene Gesserit, who intended to breed her to the [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]] heir Leto I, to produce a daughter who would then breed with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen/DE|Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]] in order to produce the [[Kwisatz Hadarach/DE|Kwisatz Hadarach]], the one who would not only possess the genetic memories of all male and female ancestors, but also see into the future. 

Consequently, Jessica was provided with the most intense and advanced Bene Gesserit training on [[Wallach IX/DE|Wallach IX]] enduring 14 years of education in "mothering".  She learned to understand and control her organism to be the fittest possible mother (as to the Sisterhood biology was destiny); and also to observe, understand and control others, and thus keep everyone  psychological "children" to her "maternal influence" (which, to the Sisterhood, was the strongest life-force).<ref name=jessica/>

===With Duke Leto===

In [[10175 AG]], the headmistress of the Bene Gesserit school on Caladan offered her as a present to Duke Leto as a [[Bound Concubine]].  She was given via one of his buyers, after careful investigation by the [[mentat/DE|mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat/DE|Thufir Hawat]]. It was thus with some trepidation that the buyer introduced Jessica to Leto and discreetly removed himself from their presence.

After a few hours the Duke arrived for his meal, with the new concubine on his arm (a privilege never granted any other concubine) and during the dinner, he included Jessica in the table conversation. The next day, Leto announced to the worried buyer that he was dismissed as he no longer required the services of a buyer, and offered him the position of a quartermaster-general; to take charge of all trade to and from Caladan.

Although she had orders to conceive a daughter, Jessica knew that the loving intimacy of equal free selves was the only true generative force in the universe, and gave the Duke the son he always wanted, thus embracing a much fuller and substantive motherhood that the Sisterhood ever projected.<ref name=jessica/> It was announced 5 months later that the Lady Jessica was to bear the Duke's first child and a boy was born 4 months later, and was named Paul. This new family led the Duke to adopt a more domestic lifestyle. He threw himself fully into the education of his son, so that he would grow up worthy of the Atreides crest. 

In [[10191 AG]], when House Atreides was given the fiefdom of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], Jessica relocated there along with Leto and their son Paul. However, their rule was short-lived, thanks to the scheme orchestrated by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV/DE|Shaddam Corrino IV]] and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

When [[House Harkonnen/DE|House Harkonnen]] seized control of Arrakis, Leto was killed, and Jessica and Paul became renegade, and escaped into the deep desert, eventually joining the [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]].<ref name=time/> Her grief over losing Leto, who was killed during the Harkonnen attack, was somewhat muddied by the knowledge that she was pregnant with his daughter [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]].

[[Stilgar/DE]] had received an order from [[Liet-Kynes/DE]] to take a band out into the desert with in search of Paul Atreides and his mother and messages sent back to the sietch by the [[Shadout Mapes/DE]] had indicated that Jessica might be something more. [[Chani Kynes/DE]] was in that group, and [[Ramallo/DE]] wished to hear her impressions of the encounter. Jessica bested Stilgar in single combat using her [[weirding way]]s. The hot-tempered [[Jamis/DE]] challenged Jessica's part in the legend and Paul killed him with a knife.<ref name=chani>Atreides, Lady Chani</ref> [[Stilgar/DE]] brought them to the [[Sietch Tabr]].<ref>Agarves, Buer</ref>

===Reverend Mother=== 

[[Image:Dune210106-12.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|The Lady Jessica takes the Water of Life]] The Fremen of Arrakis were encouraged by Jessica's arrival, for two reasons. Firstly, their own Reverend Mother [[Ramallo]] was old and near death. With Ramallo's training Jessica was the perfect choice to replace her as she could not live long enough for Chani to replace her.<ref name=chani/> Secondly, the coming of the Fremen messiah was foretold many eons prior (through Bene Gesserit mechanisms), and that he was to be born of a Bene Gesserit. Despite knowing the repercussions of becoming a full-fledged Reverend Mother, Jessica undertook the process of ingesting the toxic liquid of a young [[sandworm/DE|sandworm]] to produce the [[Water of Life/DE|Water of Life]]. This act not only elevated her to Reverend Mother status but also fundamentally changed the fetus she was carrying, causing [[Abomination/DE|Abomination]].

Jessica ahd misgivings concerning the "marriage of youth" between her son and Chani.<ref name=chani/>

When the existence of Alia was learned by the Bene Gesserit, they immediately ordered secret assassinations of both Jessica and Alia in spite of the enormous risks, but more rational thought prevailed, and they decided to study this Abomination for information needed to destroy her, while wooing her mother back into the ranks.<ref name=alia>Atreides, Alia</ref> 

Jessica led negotiations proceeding Paul's formal acceptance by the [[Landsraad/DE]] and the [[Spacing Guild/DE]], with Chani as her assistant in bargaining with the outgoing emperor, resulting to Jessica often saying, that she hoped never to have to negotiate any kind of terms against a Fremen, since their ferocity in battle paled before their determination at a conference table. During one of assassination attempts against Chani, Jessica focused her attention on Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]], soon to be Paul's Consort-in-name. She was genuinely stunned, and a brief expression of surprised delight escaped her (as she had been angered by her secondary place) before her Bene Gesserit training could conceal it, convincing Jessica of her innocence.<ref name=chani/>

During the [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/DE|Muad'Dib's Jihad]], Lady Jessica stayed on Caladan, refusing the Fremen any access to the planet, including religious pilgrimage. 

During her stay there, she outthought and outgrew her BG conditioning. After Paul's disappearance, she proved herself a formidable diplomat, intriguer and psychological warrior countering Alia's plots against Atreides ideals.<ref name=jessica/>

Her last involvement with the Sisterhood was compiling the [[Report on Alia Atreides]] in 10211. She made vigorous attempts to change the condemning tone of the final report.<ref name=alia/> 

===Later Years===

[[Image:Jessica2.jpg|thumb|Lady Jessica by M.Stribling]]Jessica returned to Arrakis, long after Paul's believed death, to again inspect his children [[Leto Atreides II/DE|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima]], in the hope of them not being Abomination and of returning control of the bloodline to the Bene Gesserit. While visiting, Jessica sensed the latent power present in the twins, and upon the realization that they could be a threat to the psychologically unstable Alia, pressed her Fremen  allies to help protect them. 

However, while on her mission she discovered that her own daughter, Alia, who was acting as regent, was possessed by the late Vladimir Harkonnen, who was driving her to destroy the [[Atreides Empire]] out of revenge.

The Sisterhood sent a delegation to Caladan, asking the help from Lady Jessica to investigating her daughter. Jessica knew that the purpose of her Sisters would be to destroy the Abomination, so she accepted to help Alia to save herself. For her protection against her murdering daughter, in [[10218 AG]] Jessica left [[Castle Caladan/DE|Castle Caladan]]. Soon after she arrived to Arrakeen, [[Duncan-10208]] delivered her to [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]] to [[Salusa Secundus/DE|Salusa Secundus]]. and Alia expanded her control of the [[Imperium/DE]].<ref name=alia/><ref name=time/>.

There, she taught [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Farad'n Corrino]] the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his role as husband to Ghanima and royal scribe to Leto II.

In 10220 Jessica, Leto, Ghanima, Farad'n, even Duncan Idaho and [[Gurney Halleck/DE]] planned against Alia.<ref name=alia/> 

Jessica returned to Arrakis and watched her son Paul; and daughter Alia, die.

==Character and traits==

In the thousands of years after her death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood attibuted her universe-changing decisions (and the loss of control of the Kwisatz Haderach) to having fallen in love with "her Duke." Her falling in love became known, in millennia afterwards, as "the Jessica Crime." For the Sisterhood, Jessica's experience was regarded as a valuable lesson in showing restraint for the good of the Sisterhood and of humanity in general.

===Archetypal analysis===

By application of the material found ''[[The Book of Ghanima]]'' ([[RRC]] 13-A700) where Ghanima Atreides studies the roots of her name, it seems that Jessica is the fulfillment of Archetypes prophesied by the ancient [[Terra]]n seer [[Seegee Jhung]] who outlined a theory explained the ''anima'' aspect of her name.  

Applied to the Jhung's archetypes, Jessica was raised as a Mother, evolved into Hetaira; as a Hetaira she infused her Medial wisdom with personal caring.<ref name=jessica/> 

Jessica always believed the BG dogma that Archetypes were illusions the BG should use to manipulate the gullible.<ref name=jessica/>

She often complained that she was raised as a "brood mare". She confounded her teachers by transcending their concept of maternity and evolved into another dimension of selfhood.  Although she did not so much revolt, the BG thought her an unSisterly rebel against their discipline, when she became the true companion of the Duke. Although taken as the Duke's Lady, Jessica never became his wife; few societal sanctions supported/confined her Archetypal companionate vitality as a Hetaira, a need which she insteilled to her descendants. She never stopped loving him for the rest of her life.<ref name=jessica/>

She discovered her Amazonian strength while pregnant in the wilderness of Arrakis and displayed her fullest against the Abominable companionship of Alia and Vladimir. As an Amazon she preserved independent individual selfhood against the harsh deserts of Dune, the political turmoils, and the onslaughts of the collective unconscious. Her Amazon's resourceful objectivity eventually outgrew her BG conditioning.<ref name=jessica/>

As a Medium, and thanks to her balanced and tuned self-consciousness, she bridged the unconscious world and the human community, as a Reverend Mother.  During the [[spice-trance]], the [[spice/DE|melange]] catalyzed her evolution but her psyche stabilized and vivified it. As a Medium she maintained a cosmic perspective on her involvements and her Medial energies saved her from the centripetal egotism (which crushed her children).<ref name=jessica/> 

These experiences introduced Jessica to her psyche's core, she found the Motherhood which the Sisterhood had lost, and she sensed the Great Mother within herself, debilitating her skepticism. As a Mother, she felt the Great Mother as an exterior presence sought after Liet-Kynes and Leto II. She understood that all forms, processes and roles are channels for the Great Mother's creative and sustaining energies. To that teaching she devoted her mature life, which she imparted to Farad'n.<ref name=jessica/>

The Preacher
{{Original}}
[[Image:Preacher01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Preacher addresses a crowded marketplace in Arrakeen, thundering against Alia's regency]]'''The Preacher''' was the name given to a mysterious blind prophet who appeared on [[Arrakis]] during the Imperial regency of [[Alia Atreides]].

He was guided by a boy, and frequently appeared in [[Arrakeen]] to rail against both the [[Atreides Empire]] and the environmental changes occurring on the planet. His oratories evoked a variety of emotions from the people of the city, including awe, reverence, anger, and ridicule.

After meeting with [[Leto Atreides II]] in the deep desert the Preacher revealed himself to be [[Paul Atreides]], who had been captured by a [[sietch]] of rogue [[Fremen]] known as [[Jacarutu]] when he went out into the desert to die, shortly after the birth of his children and the death of his concubine, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]].

The Preacher was ultimately assassinated in the main square in Arrakeen, just prior to Leto II taking the throne, with only a handful of individuals (including Leto Atreides II and [[Gurney Halleck]]) knowing his true identity. Thus, all that the great Paul Atreides was had become legend.

His message was deep and profoundly rooted in the reality of his day: Muad'Dib was worshiped blindly by the common folk as 'the messiah' of Arrakis and the parasitic [[Qizarate]] priesthood took full advantage of this fact. What The Preacher did was to try to awaken his people to the reality of their ignorance, especially since, unknown to most, the "messiah' myth of Arrakis was planted by the Bene Gesserit's [[Missionaria Protectiva]].

''"You fool yourselves with images you cannot possibly understand. You cripple yourselves with these toads of ritual and ceremony!" ''he tells a bewildered audience. This is the essence of his message: the ignorance of the ordinary every-day citizen of Arrakis of having worshiped a man as a god (note that he calls them "idolaters") and the foolishness of submitting blindly to a group of power-hungry, traitorous fools. But it was only after the end of Leto II's reign (and the beginning of the Golden Path) that humanity realized the great extent to which it had been sabotaged for centuries by Bene Gesserit interests, Guild intrigues and disrupted in its enlightenment by petty feuds and individualism.

The Preacher was played by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Newman Alec Newman] in the ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)]]''.

'''Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade''' [d. [[15240 AG]]] was the penultimate [[Bene Gesserit]] Mother Superior, holding the position for a large portion of the [[War of the Sisterhoods]]. 

As with many [[Reverend Mother]]s, Odrade was plucked from obscurity at a young age by the Sisterhood, who recognized her genetic traits as holding great promise for their ranks. Odrade's ancestry was predominantly ancient Atreides, Harkonnen and [[Corrino]] genes, and [[other memory]] later revealed to her that she bore a strong resemblance to the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]]. Indeed, her name ''Odrade'' was derived from ''Atreides, ''according to [[Hedley Tuek]], head of the Rakian Priesthood.

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|14900s-15229}} ===
Odrade was haunted by childhood memories of her foster mother. She also had a tendency toward romanticism and compassion. Such reminiscences and feelings were frowned upon by the Sisterhood, and Odrade projected them into a secret alter-ego named ''[[Sea Child]]''. Odrade was a natural daughter of [[Miles Teg]] with a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother in extremis, who gave her child to a foster couple on the planet [[Gammu]] in order to hide her from hunters, since Odrade was an [[Atreides]] descendant. This couple, whom Odrade remembered as Mama Sibia and Papa, loved little Darwi as their own child and took care of her until the Bene Gesserit returned for her six years later when it was safe. Reverend Mothers, accompanied by assistants and guards, arrived at the couple's house near the seashore and took little Darwi from Mama Sibia's home. Darwi recognized that the sisters had used The Voice on Mama Sibia, when the latter rejected to receive the money the sisters wanted to give her.

After taking her from Sibia, Proctors tried to root out Odrade's "deep desire for personal affinities", but failed at last, not quite sure they had failed but always suspicious. Finally, they sent her to Al Dhanab, the Bene Gesserit planet deliberately mantained as a mimic of the worst in the terrible Salusa Secundus. However, none of the dangerous environment on Dhanab touched the "secret core" with in odrade, the ''Sea Child.''

Sent to the Bene Gesserit School after surviving Dhanab, little Darwi befriended [[Alma Mavis Taraza]], an older Sister who took her under her wing. Odrade and Taraza's friendship was a strong bond between them, and both of them used their nicknames, ''Dar ''(short for Darwi) and ''Tar ''(for Taraza). Proctors repeatedly rebuked the girls, arguing that such feelings were prohibited in the Sisterhood. Taraza later rose to the rank of Mother Superior of the Sisterhood.

At some point, Odrade undertook the Spice Agony, surviving and becoming a Reverend Mother. Odrade came to be regarded as highly skilled, though her superiors also considered her strong risk-taker. As a result, Mother Superior Taraza came to trust her judgment during crisis.

=== War of the Sisterhoods ===

====Honored Matres' ambush====

In [[15229 AG]], Taraza sent Odrade to [[Rakis]] in order to determine the truth regarding [[Sheeana]], the girl who could apparently control the [[sandworms]] there. Before going to Rakis, Taraza fell into a trap crafted by the Honored Matres. The Mother Superior and her staff (Odrade among them) were transported to a [[Heighliner|Guild Heighliner]] in Gammu's orbit, the planet where the Sisterhood's ghola of [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho]] was being trained by Supreme Bashar Miles Teg and [[Lucilla|Reverend Mother Lucilla]]. Taraza sent a message to Teg telling him to be prepared for violence, a thing that surprised the Old Bashar. After forcing an Honored Matres' male commander to release Taraza and her staff using nothing but his strategic mind, the [[Mother Superior]] revealed to Teg that she intentionally fell into the trap because she wanted to know why the Matres were so anxious to know about the Duncan Idaho [[ghola]].

At the Bene Gesserit Keep on Gammu, Odrade talked with Teg, who had recognized her among Taraza's guards. Odrade revealed to him that she was, in fact, his daughter. Surprised, Teg wondered if [[Lucilla]], due to her similarity to Odrade, was also his daughter. Odrade explained that the reason that she and Lucilla were so similar, and bore a strong resemblance to the [[Jessica|Lady Jessica]], was that both of them were [[Atreides]]. However, she added that Lucilla wasn't her sister or daughter, as she came from a different bloodline. She finally said goodbye to Teg, leaving Gammu for Rakis.
====On Rakis====
On Rakis, Odrade replaced [[Tamalane|Reverend Mother Tamalane]] as head of the Bene Gesserit Keep of Rakis, located in the city of [[Arrakeen|Keen]]. Odrade's arrival attracted the attention of [[Sheeana Brugh]], the Holy Child of the [[Rakian Priesthood]]. High Priest Hedley Tuek offered to present Odrade to Sheeana, and sent [[Kipuna]] (an [[acolyte]], Sheeana's physical trainer and a friend of the Bene Gesserit) to give the message to the Bene Gesserit Keep. However, just as Kipuna was leaving, an [[Attack on the Church of the Divided God|assassination attempt]] took place on the Rakian Temple's terrace. Kipuna commanded Sheeana, Tuek, and old priestess Cania to leave the terrace, and she and the High Priest' guards sacrificed themselves to save them, while Tuek, holding Sheeana in his arms and followed by Cania, tried to escape. They were found by a crowd of [[sister|Bene Gesserit sisters]] headed by Odrade, who took the girl and ordered the sisters to clear the terrace of enemies, where the corpse of an Old Priest named Stiros was found. Once the situation was under control, Odrade and Sheeana started a bond of friendship, which would last until Odrade's death.
====Training Sheeana====
Odrade took Sheeana under her wing, training her in the [[Bene Gesserit Training|Bene Gesserit ways]], and told the curious girl to learn from her silence. She felt surprised at Sheeana's intelligence, and was also surprised when the girl expressed her desire to become a full Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. Before one of Sheeana's training sessions, while Odrade was waiting for her, she observed, fascinated, the ancient ritual of the [[Siaynoq]] being performed by the citizens of Keen, and recognized it not only a cultural tradition but also as, one of the remnants of [[Leto II]].
====Problems with the Rakian Priesthood and Tuek's replacement====

[[File:Odrade_&_Waff.jpg|thumb|Odrade and Waff - fanart by Lone Star Fedaykin]]

After the incident on the Rakian Temple's terrace, [[Hedley Tuek]] felt that the Bene Gesserit were taking too many responsibilities that concerned the [[Rakian Priesthood]], such as Sheeana's safety. Odrade argued that his incompetence had almost caused Sheeana's death, and that she had informed [[Supreme Bashar]] Miles Teg to bring reinforcements and inspect [[Rakis]]' defenses in order to prevent a major disaster. Tuek felt humilliated, remembering his father had strongly dealt with both the [[Bene Tleilax]] and the Bene Gesserit, and felt ashamed that the Tleilaxu ambassador [[Tylwyth Waff]] was behind the Hall's curtains listening to the conversation, where Tuek had declared that the Atreides Manifest was no more than pure heresy.

During the meeting, Odrade (who already knew that Waff was hiding behind the curtains) asked the High Priest why he asked help of the [[Tleilaxu]], and Tuek answered desperately that they wanted back their Holy Child Sheeana. Odrade told Waff to enter the hall alone. Odrade revealed to Tuek that the Tleilaxu were the ones who had been publishing the Atreides Manifest through many worlds, and Waff answered that they didn't write it. Finally, Waff tried to kill both Odrade and [[Hedley Tuek|Tuek]] with poisoned darts hidden on his bracelets, but Odrade was faster and broke his arms using her Bene Gesserit fight skills. However, one dart reached its target, killing Tuek.

Odrade spared Waff's life and offered him an alliance between the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the Bene Tleilax, against all the forces emerging from [[The Scattering]]. Odrade also tricked Waff, making him believe that the Bene Gesserit shared the same faith of the Tleilaxu. Waff considered such revelation a miracle, there, on the Prophet's planet. Both agreed that a [[Face Dancer]] should occupy the seat of Tuek, and deceive the other priests while Odrade, Waff and Sheeana went to the desert, where a surprising revelation awaited them.

====Message of Leto II====
<p style="text-align:right">''"A REVEREND MOTHER WILL READ MY WORDS!"''</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Leto II.</p>
Sheeana took both Odrade and Waff to the desert, leaving the city of Keen watched from the sky by [[Ornithopter]]s of both the Bene Gesserit and the Rakian Priesthood. Before they went to the deep desert, a Rakian priest named [[Albertus]] asked Odrade why she took the Tleilaxu master with her instead of a member of the Rakian Priesthood. Odrade answered that she would not tolerate delay in her mission, and that Sheeana had chosen Waff to join her. Once they left Keen, they passed through some ancient bridges filled with sand, and Odrade recognized through her Other Memories that during the days of the God Emperor, the [[Idaho River]] had passed under that bridge. She saw the scene when Leto II fell from the bridge together with [[Hwi Noree]] and [[Moneo Atreides]], and realized that it was there where the God Emperor's dream had started. Odrade, Sheeana and Waff were transported by an enormous sandworm to an unknown location, which Odrade later discovered as the site of the ancient [[Sietch Tabr]], home of the Fremen [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]].

Once there, Odrade found the ceremonial chamber where [[Paul Muad'Dib]] had given his speech to the [[Fremen]], as well as where Leto II had been born and walked through. After having found dead bodies of possible [[spice]] smugglers, Odrade discovered a chamber where the God Emperor had left a message for the Bene Gesserit:



<p style="text-align:right">''"I BEQUEATH TO YOU MY FEAR AND LONELINESS. TO YOU I GIVE THE CERTAINTY THAT THE ''''BODY AND SOUL OF THE BENE GESSERIT WILL MEET THE SAME FATE AS ALL OTHER BODIES ''''AND ALL OTHER SOULS."''</p>



''"WHAT IS SURVIVAL IF YOU DO NOT SURVIVE WHOLE? ASK THE BENE TLEILAX THAT! WHAT ''''IF YOU NO LONGER HEAR THE MUSIC OF LIFE? MEMORIES ARE NOT ENOUGH UNLESS THEY ''''CALL YOU TO NOBLE PURPOSE!"''


<p style="text-align:right">''"WHY DID YOUR SISTERHOOD NOT BUILD THE GOLDEN PATH? YOU KNEW THE NECESSITY. ''''YOUR FAILURE CONDEMNED ME, THE GOD EMPEROR, TO MILLENNIA OF PERSONAL DESPAIR."''</p>




''"MY WORDS ARE YOUR PAST, ''''MY QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLE:"''

''"WITH WHOM DO YOU ALLY?''
<p style="text-align:right">'''"WITH THE SELF-IDOLATORS OF TLEILAX?''</p>

<p style="text-align:right">''"WITH MY FISH SPEAKER BUREAUCRACY?''</p>

<p style="text-align:right">''"WITH THE COSMOS-WANDERING GUILD?''</p>
'''"WITH [[Harkonnen|HARKONNEN]] BLOOD SACRIFICERS?''

''"WITH A DOGMATIC SINK OF YOUR OWN CREATION?''

''"HOW WILL YOU MEET YOUR END?''

''"AS NO MORE THAN A SECRET SOCIETY?"''



This message prompted Odrade to realize Taraza's plan.

==== As Mother Superior ====
Odrade attained ''de facto'' [[Mother Superior]] rank due to her presence and subsequent sharing with Mother Superior Taraza at her death on Rakis and her elite status within the Bene Gesserit. Her order was not entirely satisfied with this arrangement, but ultimately accepted it due to the developing crisis with the Honored Matres as well as Odrade's successful performance on Rakis in discovering [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II's]] [[Spice Melange|spice]] hoard, recruiting of Sheanna Brugh, and capture of the sandworm that precipitated the desertification of [[Chapterhouse]].

As Mother Superior, she interacted deeply with [[Bellonda]] and the old [[Tamalane]], the Bene Gesserit High Council. Given the necessity of remaining hidden on Chapterhouse until the right moment to attack the Honored Matres, Odrade's role as Mother Superior was not easy: she has to deal with several issues: the internal opposition which grew in the Sisterhood; educating Murbella in the Bene Gesserit ways; bringing up the new clone of their old [[Bashar]], Miles Teg, her father, and which [[ghola]], if awakened to his old memories, is supposed to lead them to a possible victory. Also, she had to face very tough decisions in order to reproduce the spice cycle on Chapterhouse, managing the [[Weather Control]] as Chapterhouse turned into a new Arrakis-like desert for the worms developing there. Odrade pioneered the use of axlotl technology within the Bene Gesserit, through which the clone of [[Miles Teg]] was born. She was instrumental in the indoctrination of Murbella, the only Honored Matre to be captured alive in the [[Old Empire]], which led to [[Murbella]] becoming the first Reverend Mother / Honored Matre hybrid.  

In [[15240 AG]], Odrade confronted Duncan in his no-ship prison and forced him to admit that he is a Mentat, proving that he retained the memories of his many ghola lives. Later that year, Odrade came to believe that the Sisterhood had made a mistake in fearing emotion, and that in order to evolve, they had to learn to accept emotions. After Murbella survived the spice agony and became a Reverend Mother, Odrade confronted Sheeana, now a Reverend Mother, discovering that Duncan and Sheeana had been allies for some time.  After Teg was awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appointed him again as Bashar of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the final assault on the Honored Matres.   

Odrade announced to the Bene Gesserit that Teg would lead an attack against the Honored Matres. She also made clear her intention to share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana, making them candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior if she died. Odrade met with the  [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama]] on [[Junction]] while the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg [[Battle of Gammu|attacked]] Gammu, then moving on to [[Battle of Junction|attack Junction itself]] with tremendous force and an almost certainty of success. During the attack, Dama was poisoned by the Grand Dame [[Logno]], who took the position of Great Honored Matre.   

Too late, Odrade realized that they had fallen into a trap, and the Honored Matres used a mysterious weapon to turn defeat into victory and capture her. Although Murbella saved as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she could and the Bene Gesserit force withdrew to Chapterhouse. Odrade, who had planned for the possible failure of the attack and had left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Odrade was killed by [[Elpek]] in melee between Murbella, who had landed on Junction under the guise of an Honored Matre escaped from Bene Gesserit captivity, and Great Honored Matre Logno, which Murbella won, and then shared with Odrade to absorb her newest memories, as they had already shared prior to the battle.

=== Legacy ===
In many ways, Darwi Odrade's life resembled that of her Imperial ancestors, the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]], [[Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]], and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]]. Like them, Odrade possessed natural abilities that made her capable of rising through the ranks of her social structure to a position of leadership relatively quickly, through unconventional but brilliant tactics. Like her ancestors, she was able to use diplomacy, insight, and sometimes violence to achieve her goals. From her position of leadership, she managed to bring about enormous change to her society, for the survival of the human race, but it would be at the cost of her own life. Thus the Atreides legacy had been passed on to her through the eons.

Lucilla
{{Original}}


'''Lucilla''' was a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]] and [[Imprinter]]. Her most important task (following orders from [[Mother Superior]] [[Alma Mavis Taraza|Taraza]]) was to sexually imprint the young final [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]] during his training on [[Gammu]]. Later, she was Vice-Chancellor of [[Lampadas]] in the name of Mother Superior Odrade, and was the savior of the millions of memories of the [[Lampadas Horde]] after [[Battle of Lampadas (15240 AG)|its destruction]] by the [[Honored Matres]]. [[File:Lucilla.jpg|thumb|Lucilla, disguised as an Honored Matre, from the Hungarian cover of Heretics of Dune.]]

== Biography ==

===On Gammu===
[[Alma Mavis Taraza]], [[Mother Superior]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]], commanded the very talented [[Reverend Mother]] Lucilla, to sexually imprint the [[Duncan Idaho gholas|twelfth ghola of Duncan Idaho]] that the Sisterhood bought from the [[Tleilaxu]]. In fact, Taraza's plan was far more complex than the intelligent and clever Lucilla could have thought. Taraza warned the young sister about the commander of the Bene Gesserit Keep of [[Gammu]], [[Schwangyu|Reverend Mother Schwangyu]], an important member within the Sisterhood and, above all, Taraza's main detractor.

Thus, Lucilla, known recently as "The Young Odrade" (due to her physical similarity to elite Reverend Mother [[Darwi Odrade]]), reached her post on Gammu, where she was received by Schwangyu. The Old Reverend Mother recognized the talents of her young pair, and also recognized the [[Atreides]] lineage from which Lucilla came. Schwangyu also noted that Lucilla had borne three children to the Sisterhood, two of which were from the same father.  

Unfortunately for Lucilla, Idaho was impervious to imprinting due to [[Bene Tleilax]] genetic manipulation. As a result, Idaho ignored Lucilla's advances, much to the amusement and awe of [[Miles Teg]], who had awakened Idaho's memories at odds with Lucilla's techniques.

Lucilla subsequently posed as an Honored Matre, with [[Burzmali]] as her sexual slave, in order to infiltrate the Honored Matre presence on [[Gammu]] while in search of the abducted Duncan Idaho.

Despite Lucilla being loyal to the Sisterhood, it was evident to Teg that she had aspirations of her own. Indeed, Teg had mused that Lucilla aspired to the title of [[Lady]], especially since [[House|Great Houses]] were beginning to re-emerge from obscurity.

Lucilla ultimately died as a captive of the Supreme Honored Matre, [[Dama]], after absorbing the memories (and thus, Other Memories) of the Bene Gesserits on [[Lampadas]].

'''Supreme Bashar Miles Teg''' ([[14929 AG]] - [[15229 AG]]) was a highly regarded [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] military commander and [[Mentat/XD|Mentat]]. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Teg, who lived some 1500 years after the death of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], was a product of the Bene Gesserit [[breeding program]], down the line of [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides]] genes. He was the eldest son of [[Loschy Teg]] and [[Janet Roxbrough]], and from an early age was conditioned to serve the interests of the Bene Gesserit.

He was regarded as an excellent example of pure breeding (whereby he possessed all of the physical and mental attributes of a classic Atreides male), to the point where he was said to resemble [[Leto Atreides I|Leto I]] almost exactly, with the exception of being somewhat taller. Indeed, when Teg first saw the [[ego-likeness]] of the Duke Leto in a Bene Gesserit library, he had regarded the experience as looking into a mirror; suggesting that not only did he possess the facial features as the old Duke, but his mannerisms as well.

Teg's training through the Bene Gesserit involved much of the learning instilled in [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mothers]]. This was largely attributed to Teg's mother, who was a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother herself. Therefore Teg was both a Mentat and a Bene Gesserit adept, a combination that made him a formidable military commander for the Sisterhood.

Shortly before his thirteenth birthday, Miles Teg was sent away to advanced schooling at the Bene Gesserit stronghold on [[Lampadas]], where his mother’s assessment of him was confirmed. Word went back to her: “You have given us the Warrior Mentat we had hoped for.” Teg did not see this note, inscribed on a small sheet of ridulian crystal, until sorting through his mother’s effects after her death. 

=== Military career ===

Teg had spent his career commanding Bene Gesserit military forces. He had developed a reputation for superior ability in successfully commanding men in battle, as well as engendering truces between implacable enemies. His successes were attributed to his genetic inheritance, since the men of the Atreides line were known to be charismatic and could elicit fierce loyalty in those who followed them. This potential was capitalised upon by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood through their training of him. He had multiple daughters, including [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] (and later [[Mother Superior/XD|Mother Superior]]) [[Darwi Odrade]] and his eldest, [[Dimela]], who herself had three children. [[Lucilla]] was also possibly a daughter of his.

=== On Gammu ===

Teg retired from a successful career to his home planet of [[Lernaeus]]. However, some time after his retirement, he was called back to active duty to train a [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola/XD|ghola]] for the Bene Gesserit, as well as to activate his dormant memories and personality. The Sisterhood believed that Teg's superior abilities, as well as his resemblance to Leto I would assist in this matter, since the original Duncan Idaho had maintained a strong relationship with the Duke. During this period, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade revealed to him that she was his daughter, and speculated that her fellow Reverend Mother Lucilla could also be among his offspring.[[File:Idaho12.jpg|thumb|left|The twelfth ghola of Duncan Idaho, depicted in the Hungarian cover of Heretics of Dune.]]

After Teg had managed to restore Duncan's memories, [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]] forces attempted to capture him and Duncan, using both [[Face Dancers]] and people returning from [[Scattering/XD|The Scattering]]. However, Teg used several cunning, unexpected, and brilliant military tactics to help Duncan and [[Lucilla]] escape the attack, but Teg himself was captured. During his subsequent interrogation, Teg was tortured severely with a [[T-Probe]]. The extreme pain he experienced during this torture awoke prescient abilities in him, as well as extremely heightened physical and mental abilities that allowed him to overpower his interrogators and escape.

=== Death ===
Following his escape Teg gathered many retired war veterans from Gammu who had served under him. He then travelled to [[Arrakis/XD|Rakis]] where he created a diversion to allow Duncan and Reverend Mother Lucilla to escape. Teg was killed in this diversion, which was [[Battle of Rakis|a massive battle]] involving millions between forces of the Bene Gesserit and the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]].

=== Rebirth as a Ghola ===

Some years later, however, he was brought back from the dead as a ghola (they referred to him as a&nbsp;ghola but he was&nbsp;actually a clone, as his cells were harvested prior to the death of the original Miles Teg)&nbsp;by the Bene[[File:Teg.jpg|thumb|The Ghola of Miles Teg, from the Hungarian cover of Chapterhouse: Dune.]] Gesserit, in an axlotl tank made with technology borrowed from the Bene Tleilaxu. In a curious reversal of roles, the original Miles Teg memories were awakened in the ghola by Sheeana (under the direction of Duncan Idaho). Duncan theorized that Sheeana could reawaken Teg's memories via Imprinting, but an original memory of hypnotrance suggestion (by Teg's mother) to repel Imprinting caused the necessary trauma for Teg's original memories to be restored. He then commanded forces which ultimately led to the subjugation of the Honored Matres under the Bene Gesserit.

After the merging of the Honored Matres and the Bene Gesserit into the [[New Sisterhood]], Ghola Teg left to join the scattering led by [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]].

=== On the ''Ithaca''===
Teg found himself aboard the ''[[Ithaca]]'' when it escaped from [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]], along with Duncan Idaho, Sheeana, the [[Tleilexu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]], and the rest of the crew. Teg had the prescient ability to see the gossamer strands of the [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]] that the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]], [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], were trying to use to capture the vessel; although he saw them much fainter that Idaho.

When Idaho folded space to a different universe, Teg found himself in the unlikely position of taking orders from the older ghola, even though he had all of the memories of the former [[Bashar/XD|Bashar]]. As Duncan realized that the ''Ithaca'' could be on a multi-year journey began to delegate responsibility aboard the city-sized [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]]. Both Teg and Idaho agreed that Teg should be in charge of ship's security, and Teg was in full agreement of Sheeana's plan in creating a ghola of [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]]; to aide him in this role.

Miles Teg was killed in [[15264 AG]] while the ''Ithaca'' was attempting to escape [[Synchrony]].

'''Supreme Bashar Miles Teg''' ([[14933 AG]] - [[15229 AG]]) was a highly regarded [[Bene Gesserit]] military commander and [[Mentat]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|14933-14946}} ===
Miles Teg, who lived some fifteen hundred years after the death of the [[Leto Atreides II|Tyrant God-Emperor Leto II]], was a product of the Bene Gesserit [[breeding program]], down the line of the [[House Atreides]] genes. He was the eldest son of [[Loschy Teg]] and [[Lady]] [[Janet Roxbrough]], born on [[Lernaeus]] and from an early age was conditioned to serve the interests of the Bene Gesserit. As such, Miles Teg was regarded as an excellent example of pure breeding (whereby he possessed all of the physical and mental attributes of a classic Atreides male), to the point where he was said to resemble [[Leto Atreides I]] almost exactly, with the exception of being somewhat taller.

=== Military career {{C|14933-15229}} ===
Teg spent his career commanding [[Bene Gesserit]] military forces as their [[Supreme Bashar]]. He had developed a reputation for superior ability in successfully commanding men in battle, as well as engendering truces between otherwise implacable enemies. Teg's immense successes were attributed to his genetic inheritance, since the men of the Atreides line were known to be charismatic, and could elicit fierce loyalty in those who followed them. This potential was capitalised upon by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood through their training of him, with Teg additionally being trained as a Mentat. He had multiple daughters, including [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] (and later [[Mother Superior/XD|Mother Superior]]) [[Darwi Odrade]] and his eldest, [[Dimela]], who herself had three children. Reverend Mother [[Lucilla]] was also possibly a daughter of his.

=== War of the Sisterhoods ===

==== Gammu ====
Supreme Bashar Miles Teg eventually retired from an extremely successful career to his home planet of [[Lernaeus]]. However, some time after his retirement, he was called back to active duty to train a [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]] for the Bene Gesserit, as well as to activate the ghola's dormant memories and personality. The Sisterhood believed that Teg's superior abilities, as well as his resemblance to [[Leto Atreides I]], would assist in this matter, since the original Duncan Idaho had maintained a strong relationship with the Duke. During this period, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade revealed to him that she was his daughter, and speculated that her fellow Reverend Mother Lucilla could also be among his offspring.

After Teg had managed to restore Duncan's memories, [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] forces attempted to capture him and Duncan, using both [[Face Dancers]] and people returning from the [[The Scattering|Scattering]]. While Teg used several cunning, unexpected, and brilliant military tactics to help Duncan and [[Lucilla]] escape the attack, but he was himself captured. During his subsequent interrogation, Teg was tortured severely with a [[T-Probe]]. The extreme pain he experienced during this torture awoke prescient abilities in Teg, as well as extremely heightened physical and mental abilities, all of which allowed him to overpower his interrogators and escape.

He then travelled to [[Rakis]], where he created a diversion to allow Duncan and Reverend Mother [[Lucilla]] to escape.

Some years later, however, Miles Teg was brought back from the dead as a ghola (they referred to him as a ghola, but he was actually a clone, as his cells were harvested prior to the death of the original Miles Teg) by the [[Bene Gesserit]], in an [[Axlotl Tanks|Axlotl Tank]] made with technology borrowed from the [[Bene Tleilax|Bene Tleilaxu]].

Teg then commanded forces, which ultimately led to the subjugation of the [[Honored Matres]] under the [[Bene Gesserit]].

After the merging of the Honored Matres and the Bene Gesserit into the [[New Sisterhood]] by [[Murbella]], Teg left to join the scattering led by [[Sheeana]].

== Significance ==
Miles Teg was a successful example of genetic breeding for the [[Bene Gesserit]] - he possessed all the powerful traits of the Atreides of the past, but unlike [[Paul Atreides]] and Paul's son [[Leto Atreides II]], Teg remained under complete control of the Sisterhood. This was because Teg's mother [[Janet Roxbrough]] had remained loyal to the Sisterhood, in contrast to Paul's mother [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]]. As a result, Teg's mother had managed to instill in him awe and loyalty for the Sisterhood from an early age through his upbringing and training.

Alia Atreides/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Alia Atreides}}[[File:Alia.png|thumb|Alia Atreides]]
'''Alia Atreides''', aka '''Saint Alia of the Knife''' and '''Womb of Heaven'''([[10191 AG]] - [[10219 AG]]), born in planet [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]]. Posthumous daughter of Duke [[Leto Atreides I/DE|Leto Atreides I]] and his [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] [[concubine]] [[Lady]] [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Jessica]], was the younger sister of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]].
[[Regent| Regent]] of the [[Atreides Empire]], she established an autocratic government based in the cult of her personality. In 10219 AG she committed suicide after being overpowered by [[Leto II]]  and having succumbed to [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Abomination possession] by her grandfather, the [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] .
==Biography==
===Pre-birth===
While [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Jessica Atreides]] was pregnant with Alia, she went through the [[Water of Life/DE|Water of Life]] ceremony to become a [[Reverend Mother/DE|Reverend Mother]]. The [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] did not know she was pregnant, but she could not refuse the "illuminating poison", even if she knew the effects; Alia's consciousness was permanently altered and became the first of the Atreides [[pre-born]], something Jessica's Bene Gesserit superiors had long feared.

===Early years===
Alia was born in 10191, with full awareness and knowledge of her ancestral memories. After only a few moments of crying, she looked with focused eyes around the birthing room, as in taking in every detail. Fremen women present at her birth, with knowledge abut the [[Abomination/DE|Abomination]], spread the word that the child would bear careful watching. With a curious life she drank the [[Water of Conception]] fed to her by [[Harah/DE|Harah]], her godmother.

The superstitious Fremen were impressed by her from the first moments, with precocity to every matter. When only 8 months old, she could walk, and exercised thoroughly the water discipline, known to her by accessing the Fremen memories. Her first words were "I love you, Harah". She used to sit alone at the edge of the desert practicing [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] exercises.

This odd sight was enough to make the Fremen consider the shameful [[Test of Possession]], but the stature of [[Paul Atreides/DE|her brother]] as the [[Mahdi]], and her mother, saved her from it.
[[Image:AliciaWitt.jpg|right|thumb]]
When she was only 2 years old, in 10193, she witnessed the last engagements between her brother and Shaddam IV, and Muad'Dib's Fremen. Rather than telling her brother about the death of his son during the fighting, she allowed the [[Sardaukar/DE]] to capture her, and take her to the Emperor. Standing before [[Shaddam IV/DE]], his [[Truthsayer/DE|Truthsayer/]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/DE|Gaius Helen Mohiam]] and Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]] (whom she recognised as her grandfather), she unnerved them with her poise and intelligence. Mohiam recognised to her the Abomination the Sisterhood long feared and demanded that she be killed at once, but Shaddam futilely tried to frighten her to learn her brother's whereabouts. The Baron dared to seize her, and in turn was struck with a [[Gom Jabar|poisoned needle]].<ref name=alia/>

That year Mohiam sent a report to the [[Bene Gesserit General Council]] concerning Alia's existence and nature, which caused
great consternation. The B.G. immediately ordered secret assassinations of both Jessica and Alia in spite of the enormous risks, but more rational thought prevailed, and they decided to study this Abomination for information needed to destroy her, while wooing her mother back into the ranks.<ref name=alia/>

When Alia was just 14 years old, Paul gives her to a [[ghola/DE|ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]] as a reward for fealty.<ref name=paul1>Atreides, Paul</ref>

As a young woman during the days of Muad'dib, Alia led crowds of pilgrims in prayer and prophesied for them. Being the sister of the Mahdi she was revered as Saint Alia-of-the-Knife, the divine huntress who sought out the faithless, who could not be deceived, and "The Womb of Heaven", her most popular title.<ref name=alia/>

Alia attended the funeral of [[Chani Kynes/DE|Chani Kynes]]. [[Harah/DE|Harah]] had restrained her from driving [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]] out of the cavern on sight.<ref>Atreides, Chani</ref>

===Regency===
[[Image:Alia01.jpg|left|thumb|Alia as Imperial Regent]]
Paul disappeared into the desert in [[10209 AG]], and with his children [[Leto II/DE|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima]] still too young to effectively rule remained under [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]]'s guardianship. Alia went from being a Princess to being the Imperial [[Regent]] '''Alia VIII ''' of the [[Atreides Empire]].<ref name=alia/> Jealous of the love Ghanima had for Harah, she removed her when she was 3.<ref name=ghanima>Atreides, Ghanima</ref>

One of the first acts of her regency was to execute all those who had conspired against Paul, including Mohiam, despite Paul's orders, obviously aware that she was her grandmother. This decision mared her first deviation from Atreides behavior. However she spared only the repentant Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]].
[[File:Dune alia1.jpg|thumb|Alia on the [[Golden Lion Throne]].]]
In the first month of her regency, Alia married [[Duncan Idaho-10208]], the Atreides swordmaster. Hundreds of thousands of Imperial subjects atended The ceremony in the capital city of [[Arrakeen/DE]], which followed the Fremen rites. Alia opted to omit only those sections of the ritual which involved removing her [[crysknife]] from its sheath at her waist, as showing it before a crowd of out-freyn, would alienate the Fremen.

In the next year of the Regency she dissolved the [[Fedaykin/DE|Fedaykin]].

With Jessica in Castle Caladan, and Stilgar content to defer to her, Alia was in complete control of her twin niece and nephew. She knew they were pre-born like her, knew their capabilities and what large doses of melange had done to Alia and avoided it at all costs, fearing the effects of the [[spice-trance]].<ref name=alia/> Ghanima was both terrified and empathetic, seeing in her what she would easily become.<ref name=ghanima/> Alia encouraged them otherwise, hoping they would share with her the visions of prescience they could tap into. Their lack of cooperation puzzled, annoyed and infuriated Alia.<ref name=alia/>

===Into Abomination===
[[Image:Alia02.jpg|thumb|As Abomination, Alia takes comfort in the metaphorical arms of Baron Harkonnen]]
As rebellions were put down and problems solved, however, Alia found herself more and more subject to her ancestral memories seeking a second chance, at her expense. She managed to silence them thanks to Bene Gesserit litanies and [[Zensunni/DE|Zensunni]] (which she knew from Fremen memories) but they grew stronger with time and the heavy doses of melange she used to take. Her decisions were harsh and her "divine rages" were infamous to her Aides. She ignored the advice of Idaho, and those closest to her to spare herself more.

The strain against the maddening internal voices finally became too great and to avoid fragmentation of her personality, in 10217 she made an alliance with the strong memory of Vladimir Harkonnen. Both strong personalities acting in concert they managed to shut out the voices. Around that time she started Bene Gesserit techniques to maintain her young body.

However the influence of Harkonnen corrupted her mind, resulting to a different way of decisions and actions, becoming more self-protective and less representative of the old Atreides codes. Alerted by the change, the Sisterhood sent a delegation to Caladan, asking the help from Lady Jessica to investigating her daughter. Jessica knew that the purpose of her Sisters would 
be to destroy the Abomination, so she accepted to help Alia to save herself. Soon after she arrived to Arrakeen, Jessica was a captive of [[House Corrino/DE]] and Alia expanded her control of the [[Imperium/DE|Imperium]]: Leto was presumed dead, and Ghanima who would ascend the throne, was to be engaged to [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Farad'n Corrino]].

Jessica, Leto, Ganima, Farad'n, even Idaho and [[Gurney Halleck/DE|Gurney Halleck]] planned against her in 10220. Alia put an assassin against Halleck, but when the attempt failed, she took greater risks. Idaho's death forced Stilgar to flee to the desert with Irulan and Ghanima. Her ally spent more time lusting after the young men in her court than he did helping her.

[[Zia]] brought to her [[Buer Agarves/DE|Buer Agarves]] as her new aide who would later replace [[Javid]] in Alia's plaything in bed. Early in his service, Alia sent them to [[Sietch Tabr/DE|Sietch Tabr]] with messages, and Agarves returned reporting that [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]] had killed Idaho after Idaho had killed Javid. Agarves lied that he was not present, fearing for Alia's reprisals if he admitted that he did nothing to protect them. Alia commanded him to kill Stilgar promising him to become Naib of Tabr. During one of his reports, Alia lied that that her initial command was a result of ravaging grief but now she had forgiven him and only wanted Stilgar to return to Sietch Tabr; Alia also gave him as a parting gift new boots, where a transmitter was secreted. The transmitter let Alia's forces to Stilgar's refuge, and Agarves' death.<ref>Buer Agarves</ref>

She secured Irulan and Stilgar in her dungeons and even persuaded Ghanima to accept Farad'n. But she had spread her forces too thin.

===Death===
[[File:Leto's Return|thumb|left|Leto's return and Alia's suicide. ]]
Leto was now protected and strengthened by his [[sandtrout/DE|sandtrout]] skin, arrived at [[Alia's Temple]] and could overcome her legendary prowess at hand-to-hand combat. Defeated, Alia exerted the force of her own personality one final time. In spite of the protests of her inner voices, she took her own life rather than to submit to a Fremen Trial of Possession. As she flung
herself to the Temple courtyard, she performed her first independent act in years.

Her body was removed from the courtyard and processed through the nearest [[deathstill]]; the water was carried into the desert to evaporate in the fierce sun, a Fremen way of disposing with the water of one convicted of Possession, and indicative of the low opinion held of her by that time.

==Character==
From her youth, Alia chose isolation, and as she grew older, Alia often mentioned her loneliness from the rest of humanity, increasingly blaming her mother for this condition. In certain aspects, she surpassed her brother. Jessica understood what had happened to her daughter as best as she could (for someone who had not experienced such an awakening) but could provide only little comfort.<ref name=alia/> Whenever her presence was not commanded, she absented from the Court; as a Regent she was mostly unavailable except for official duties.

Lacking her brother's prescient abilities, Alia indulged in massive doses of melange to broaden her vision although the spice-
trance most often failed her. Her heavy melange consumption was just another means of maintaining contact with her internal advisors.

She ruled as a power-hungry woman, aided by the memories of ambitious and greedy rulers, and most of her actions had the aim to solidify her position, such as her marriage, and manipulation of her nephews.<ref name=abomination/>

Alia had few close, genuine relationships, largely due to her mentally and emotionally imbalanced state. Her relationship with her mother was strained at best, and simmered with deep resentment. And her interaction with Fremen was tarnished at an early age by their fear of her abilities and knowledge.
==Legacy==
After her water was poured into the sand, her family seldom spoke about her, but Ghanima told her children about the pains of being human and in contact with their past.<ref name=ghanima/>

Princess Irulan, one of a number of B.G. spies were introduced into Muad'Dib's household posing as retainers, close to the Lady Alia even into her Regency and even until her death. Their observations, along with those of various Reverend Mothers who came into contact with her, provided the basis for the [[Report on Alia Atreides]], after which the [[Bene Gesserit Judiciary Council]] condemned Alia as an "Abomination to be Abhorred" in 10211. The authors (Sisters) of the final draft of the Report after Alia's death unanimously declared that Alia wilfully chose Abomination's way for herself, spurning all attempts to save her humanity. Her suicide relieved the Sisterhood.<ref name=abomination>Alia as Abomination</ref>

The impact of Alia's religious powerbase was long-lived. Many considered her a revered figure for several hundreds of years after her death. While worshipped during her life, as a reflected image of Muad'dib, carrying on his work, after her death she was worshipped as a divine godhead of her own. Her title as "The Womb of Heaven" was adopted by the Cults as a far more hallowed connotation (her lesser titles were discarded). The first recorded [[Cult of Alia]] was established in Arrakeen in 10970 during the rule of Leto, with [[The Book of Alia]] dedicated to her divinity.

In ''[[The Dune Catastrophe]]'', [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Harq al-Ada]] makes the very point that Alia was capable of encompassing each of the contradictory personalities with which she has been credited, citing the opinion of Ghanima Atreides: "My aunt chose her own course at many junctures, but the opportunity to choose was not always given her. Leto and I pitied her even as we feared her, and I believe that she often felt the same mix of emotions toward herself."<ref name=alia/>

[[Bronso of Ix]], in [[The Atreides Imperium]], dismisses Alia as "a self-made disaster". A similar opinion is held by [[Lors Karden]] author of [[Truth and Fancy in the Oral History]].<ref name=abomination/>

'''House Atreides''' had been one of the [[Great Houses/DE|Great Houses]] within the galactic infrastructure of the [[Imperium/DE|Imperium]]. They were ruled by the patriarch of the Atreides family, who took the title of ''Duke''.

A rich history for the Atreides, as well as various other titles, including: the [[House of Pelops]], and successively Lords of [[Tantalos]], Counts of [[Thuestes]], Counts of [[Aramanli]],Counts [[Chalcedony]], Siridar Counts of [[Hoosak Norn]], in the [[Cleo System]], Siridar Counts of [[Hestia]], Dukes of [[Atreus]], Siridar Dukes of [[Gallatin]], Siridar Dukes of [[Caladan/DE|Caladan]], Siridar Dukes of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], and Emperors of the Known Universe; junior titles include Barons [[Pelops]], Barons [[Menelaus]], Barons [[Aigisthos]], Counts Atreides, Counts [[Gamnonides]]; distaff titles include Barons [[Mukenai]], Lords [[Theseides]], and Counts [[Delos]].

==Origins==
Other than the claimed ancestry from the legendary [[House of Pelops]] and [[Atreus]], the first recorded forefather of the House was [[Agamemnon d'Atreides]], governor of the [[Brunig District]], who died during the [[Butlerian Jihad/DE]].<ref name=found/>
==History==
The ancestry of the House can be traced to [[Mockmuhl Cluster]], from which the founder of the House, [[Demetrios Atreides]] was descended. He fought at the [[Battle of Corrin/DE|Battle of Corrin]] on the side of the future first Emperor [[Sheuset I]]. He was ennobled as Baron [[Tantalos]] by Sheuset thanks to his military actions; he was given large estates on [[Enskog]]. His three sons [[Pausanias Atreides|Pausanias]], whose son became [[Demetrios II Atreides|Demetrios II]] became Count [[Thuestes]]; [[Theseus Atreides|Theseus]], who assisted the expansion of the Imperium and became Baron [[Pelops]]; and [[Konstantinos Atreides|Costin]], who became Baron [[Menelaus]]. These would be the ancestors of the branches of the house.<ref name=found/>
===Against the [[House of Alman Corrino]]===
When [[Elrood I]] was assassinated in [[104 AG]] and replaced by [[Alman bin Haig]], [[Elias Atreides|Elias]] supported the exiled Emperor (perhaps [[Saudir II]]). The family's fortune fell and a bill of attainder was brought before the Landsraad against Elias, but Alman was assassinated before the bill could be acted upon, and [[Saudir II]] restored Elias' estates and titles. However [[Alman II]] redistributed the House's lands, until [[Thomas Atreides|Thomas]] managed to restore [[Elrood II]] thus becoming Duke of [[Jaddua]]. [[Alman IV]] however executed [[Thomas II Atreides|Thomas II]] in [[346 AG]] and attainted both Jaddua and the planetary fiefdom. [[Alkman Atreides]] petitioned for restoration of the County of Thuestes before the Regent [[Henli al-Qair]] in [[381 AG]].

Thenceforth the family became a [[House Major/DE]] as the imperial feudalism developed into a workable system of government.<ref name=found>Atreides, House, Foundation of</ref> Until the middle of the 5th millennium, the House had many members famous for their unique talents, flamboyant actions, or spectacular vices.<ref name=members>Atreides, House, Prominent members</ref>
===As a House Major===
[[Iason Atreides|Iason]] was instrumental in settling the differences between various branches of the Imperial House, probably the House of Alman, [[House of al-Qair]] and [[House of Rautha]], and [[Audrii I]] restored the House of Alman to the throne. Iason concentrated most of the imperial power and reorganized the government, which had been a chaos of personal rule, and reestablished the principles of The [[Great Convention]].

For his contributions he was named Count [[Aramanli]] in 635, and was given the hand of Princess [[Salusa]], thereby joining the two Houses and beginning their long and close association. His son [[Heraklios II Atreides|Heraklios II]] was named [[Imperial Chancellor]], thus maintaining the family grip on the imperial power. Other members of that family included sportsmen, hunters and patrons of the art.<ref name=members/>
===[[Civil War]]===
During [[Feyd I]]'s usurpation, 2 of the Atreides counts, [[Demetrios IX Atreides|Demetrios IX]] and [[Paulos II Atreides|Paulos II]], attempted to organize resistance to his rule which were joined by rebel Sardaukar. During that [[Civil War]], they were branded as traitors, and many Atreides members were stripped, executed, banished or enslaved; Atreides children were sent to tradesmen and shepherders, and Aramanli was lost to [[House Wikkheizer]].

Paulos however escaped with his son [[Alexios Atreides|Alexios]] and the last surviving members of the Imperial family. [[Odusseus Atreides|Odusseus]] managed a surprise raid on Feyd's regime, beginning the rebel advance from the outer colonies, until [[Josif I]] was named Emperor. Alexios was restored to all of his titles and further named Siridar Count of [[Hoosak Norn]]; Odusseus was named Count [[Chalcedony]], and given vast estates in that system.<ref name=members/>
===[[Interregnum]]===
During the internecine war of the [[Interregnum]], the "Merchant Count" [[Achilleus Atreides]] used the chaos to his advance. Selling the family estates of Chalcedony, he developed and sold resources at great cost, becoming the richest man by the end of the Interregnum, and even used his wealth against the Emperor [[Costin IV]].

His grandsons continued his practice preventing anyone from gaining great power, engineering the chaotic period known as [[Era of the Princes]]. That era ended along with their economic ascendacy when [[Sidir XIII]] killed [[Maximos Atreides]]. His son [[Peleus Atreides|Peleus]] avenged him by killing Sidir thus triggering another Interregnum of 6 years; this ended when he signed a truce with Baron [[Shahrukh Kenric]], who became the next Emperor. He gave his sister as a bride and named Peleus Siridar Count of [[Hestia]] and Duke of [[Atreus]].<ref name=members/>

[[Demetrios XVII Atreides|Demetrios XVII]] was tortured and left to die by usurper [[Harmhab Menemtahe VI]] for supporting the [[Basil III|assassinated emperor]]. Duke [[Agis III Atreides|Agis III]] was obsessed with power, accused of high treason against [[Elrood VI]] and executed by the Landsraad but without forfeiture of his titles or estates.<ref name=members/>
===The Republic===
Duke [[Kleomenes VI Atreides|Kleomenes VI]] was executed during the chaos that inaugurated the [[First Republic]].<ref name=members/> Many Houses Major and Minor suffered in those massacres and the Atreides withdrew from Hestia to [[Gallatin]] while pretenders claimed the throne.

Count [[Atreus Atreides]], claiming descent from Emperor [[Estil I]] in the female line, rallied the Sardaukar and mounted a coup d'etat proclaiming himself emperor as the first ruler of the [[House of Atreus Corrino]]. Atreus made a serious attempt to reform the federal bureaucracy, and to merge the institutions and reforms of the First Republic with the old imperial structure. His Cousine, Duke [[Pausanias VIII Atreides|Pausanias VIII]] was created Siridar Duke of Gallatin and other members of the family received lesser titles.

His son [[Mikael II]] harassed the Landsraad, accumulated personal rule, and began an unparalleled reign of terror, until a popular revolt forced him to disappear, and the [[Second Republic]] begun. That was until Mikael returned, followed by brief reigns of him and his sons. This was followed by a [[Age of Pretenders|period of revolts]] and a [[Third Republic]]. Atreides Dukes stayed out of Imperial politics for several millennia.<ref name=rule>Atreides, House, and Imperial rule</ref>
===[[House of Hajus Corrino]]===
The House, followed by other Houses Major, supported the demi-[[House of Hajus Corrino]] against the corrupt [[House of Irulon Corrino]]. Siridar Duchess [[Hippolute Atreides]] who led the support and threw her resources, was made by new Emperor [[Fredhrick al-Hajus]] Imperial Consort. Their children [[Fredhrick II]] and [[Alia VII]]. Alia's first son [[Sidir XVIII]] became Emperor, and her second son, [[Saurophon Atreides|Saurophon]], succeeded to the Duchyi. However his son, Siridar-Duke Prince [[Nestor IV Atreides|Nestor IV]] coveted the Imperial Seat of his cousin and for this he was stripped of his Imperial titles and then executed, beginning a rivarly between the two branches. The rivalry culminated to the overthrowing of Emperor [[Fredhrick IX]] by [[Tiiopa'it Roonaladh]], supported by the other Atreides clan, and the execution of [[Telemachos Atreides]].

Eventually the House supported a revolt of the [[House of Hajus Elrood Corrino|main line of the Corrinos]], against the [[House of Tiiopa'it Corrino]], which they had brought to the Throne. The House thus redeemed itself and the new Emperor [[Elrood VIII]] reconfirmed all their dignities, and further awarded the Siridar-Dukedom of [[Caladan/DE]].

===On Caladan===
[[Paulos XVI Atreides]] was he who moved the House to Caladan, and his relatives to nearby systems, when [[Castle Caladan/DE|Castle Caladan]] was completed;<ref name=rule/> descendants followed his example and became noteworthy scholars (in particular, [[Orestes II Atreides]] whose theories on the origins of novae remained unchallenged for six centuries). Others followed artistic or even religious vocations; but whatever their pursuit, they maintained a marked disinterest in recapturing the Imperial throne.<ref>Castle Caladan</ref>

The ensuing centuries saw such distinguished soldier-politicians as Siridar-Duke: the Lord High Admiral of the Fleet [[Agesipolis II Atreides]], Count [[Thomas Atreides-Gamnonides]], Baron [[Platon Atreides Gallatinos]], Lord [[Chrusostomos Atreides-Kallinikes]], [[Bashar/DE]] Count [[Klemes Atreides Hestiades]], and many others.<ref name=rule/>
The Atreides ruled Caladan for approximately 2000 years. However, this timespan of 8000 years poses a problem.

House Atreides fought alongside Houses [[House Harkonnen/DE|Harkonnen]] and [[House Kaastaar|Kaastaar]] at the [[revolt at Mask Prime|revolt]] at [[Mask Prime]]. Young na-Duke [[Leto I Atreides]] was able to win the rebellious planet while the forces of the other Houses were annihilated. His fairness and wisdom gained him the most loyal, trustworthy and honorable House force in the Imperium.

In respone to a Harkonnen raid to allied [[House Tipnear]], the Atreides combined forces with Tipnear and [[House Chusak|Chusak]] (who also suffered from the Harkonnen) and led an unofficial "black" raid against [[Giedi Prime/DE]], managing immense damage, and liberating 20000 slaves (including [[Gurney Halleck/DE]]) who were taken to Caladan.

In the [[battle of Grumman]], the Atreides forces once more saved the day.<ref name=leto>Atreides, Duke Leto I</ref>

Because they were descended from one who had been [[pre-born]] (The phenomenon was brought about by a combination of genetic factors and maternal addiction to melange) , all of the later generations of Atreides possessed the ability to achieve contact with their "inner voices" when under the influence of the [[spice/DE]]. The [[Oral History]] has many references about the Atreides descendants' extreme sensitivity to melange and its effect on their [[ancestral memories]]. The reason had been forgotten since the earliest days of Leto II's reign (the Sisterhood, never forgot it) but was rediscovered in the [[Rakis Hoard]].

Leto conducted tests when choosing his Atreides administrators, including this forced awareness. 1/3 of those died or went
mad, and aonly afer millennia of careful breeding the percentage dropped slightly; Leto kept a number of second-choice
candidates in reserve whenever testing one of the breeding lines.<ref>Atreides, Leto II, Journals of</ref>

Harah
{{Mixed}}

'''Harah''' was the [[Fremen]] wife by custom of [[Paul Atreides]]; widow of [[Jamis]]; nurse of [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]], and [[Ghanima Atreides]]; wife of [[Stilgar]]. Harah's maternal impulse drove her to lavish solicitude not only on her own children but on those of the [[House Atreides|Atreides Family]] as well.

==Life Before the Atreides==
Records recount that Harah was won by [[Geoff]]. However, the placidity of her life with Geoff was disturbed when he was challenged by Jamis, a challenge which ended in Geoff's demise and in Jamis taking Harah as his woman.

As Jamis' wife, as a desert fighter par excellence, and as the mother of [[Kaleff]] (by Geoff) and [[Orlop]] (by Jamis), Harah found the tempo of her life quickening. The greater portion of her days was spent in the [[stillsuit shops]] or the [[planting areas]], but she devoted much time to rearing her sons and creating the home she wanted for Jamis when he returned from his forays or patrols. It would appear that Harah recounted her years with Jamis as good years, full of achievement and family happiness. This domestic peace would have been shattered, however, when news reached [[Sietch Tabr]] of Jamis' death at the [[Cave of Ridges]]. Bred as a Fremen, she met the news as a Fremen: her innate resilience allowed her to meet and accept what destiny had next in store for her.

==Service To The Atreides==
By law, Jamis' [[yali]] and all his possessions, excluding the funeral gifts but including his wife and sons, belonged to [[Paul Atreides|Paul Muad'Dib]] who was [[Usul]], the boy who had dispatched Jamis in the [[Tahaddi Challenge]]. Thus, Harah became Paul's for one year, to take as wife or servant, after which time she would be free to choose as she wished. Over Harah's objections, Paul accepted her as servant. Although her pride was hurt by Paul's rejection of her charms, Harah set aside her vanity with a practicality that surprised Paul and devoted herself to serving him as one she respected and came to love. Her content was augmented when the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] asked her to be the infant Alia's nurse.

Some time after Paul and Jessica came to Sietch Tabr, Paul took [[Chani Kynes|Chani]] as his concubine. When the women and children of the sietch were forced to flee the pogrom of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] governor, Harah went with them as an honored member of Paul's household. Though lonely in exile, Harah busied herself as Alia's guardian and governess. Trying to control a child like Alia would have been a frustrating job, made more difficult by Alia's knowing and speaking of things beyond her years and by flouting traditional modes of behavior. But Harah's devotion to Alia was unflagging, defending her against the rumours and unkind words of the other women of the sietch, who were afraid of Alia. In return, Alia gave her love to Harah openly. Indeed, Alia's first words to her nurse were "I love you, Harah."

Besides raising Alia and becoming indispensable to her husband Stilgar in the years that followed Paul's ascendance to the emperor's throne, Harah became Chani's closest female friend. As Chani's intimate she stood at the side of her friend when she gave birth to the Atreides twins, Leto and Ghanima, and watched stone-faced as Chani died. It was her terrible duty to guide the now completely blind Paul Muad'Dib first to the creche that held his children and then to the pallet that held Chani's body. Harah was able to perform her last duty for her friend: to be observer of the holy truth and stand beside Chani for the last time at the [[deathstill]].

At Paul's request, Harah, as a friend of the mother, also stood beside Paul at the time of the naming of his son Leto for his paternal grandfather, and of his daughter Ghanima — over Harah's understandable objections (in Fremen 'ghanima' meant a spoil of war). With Chani dead and Paul apparently swallowed by the desert, Harah felt destiny had once more called her to play the role in which she excelled: the Atreides twins needed a mother. But the joy was tempered by disquiet, for these children were much as Alia had been: exasperating, unsettling, and sometimes terrifying. However, with her Fremen background, her sagacity, and her experience with Alia, she proved to be a match for the precocious twins. Coming to love the twins as her own, Harah was devastated by the news that Leto had fallen victim to [[Laza tiger]]s. She consoled herself by trying to console Ghanima; to ease the pain Harah applied herself to providing Stilgar with every comfort. She gave minute attention to his wardrobe and yali, supervising even the smallest housekeeping detail — preparing coffee, for example, just as Stilgar preferred it: grinding fresh roasted beans to a fine powder in a stone mortar, then boiling immediately with a pinch of [[spice melange|melange]].

But once again the evenness of her days was shattered by a crisis: early one morning Stilgar called her to view the dead bodies of [[Javid]] and, unbelievably, [[Duncan Idaho]] and to tell her that he had sent [[Buer Agarves]] to Alia with his "final obedience." But the abductors Agarves had unwittingly led to the djedida overwhelmed the fugitives and carried them off to Arrakis and Alia's prison cells. While not present in Alia's quarters in the Keep on that disastrous day when House Atreides established its millennial dynasty, Harah heard the terrible news soon enough: the death of Paul ([[The Preacher]]), the suicide of Alia, the seduction of [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]], the metamorphosis of Leto.

== Appearance ==

Harah was a woman  with eyes of dense darkness, black hair,a high forehead, sharp cheekbones, an aquiline nose and pale olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp features of her angular facial features, seeming old for her age.

==Behind the Scenes==
It was likely that Alia's death preceded by her transformation into true "Abomination," diminished Harah. That strong maternal drive that defined her existence for so many years was likely to have been struck a mortal blow. Presumably, Harah lived into old age.

In Greek, the word ''"Harah"'' means "Joy". However, in Arabic, the language from which so many Fremen terms originate, it might come from the word "Hurra" which means "Free" or the arabic name "Harra".It may also be possible that he was thinking of the Hebrew word ''"harah"'' meaning "pregnant".

In the 1984 ''Dune'' movie, Harah was portrayed by actress Molly Wryn. However, her scenes were cut from the theatrical release of the film. She did not appear and was not mentioned in the 2000 or 2003 miniseries.

Noree Moneo
{{videogame|character}}

[[File:Hqdefault-4-1-1.jpg|thumb]]

Noree Moneo was the [[Atreides]] [[Mentat]] in the video game [[Dune 2000]] in the service of Duke [[Leto Atreides]]. He was played by John-Rhys Davies.

The character never appeared again.

==Inspiration==
His name was copied from two characters ([[Hwi Noree]], [[Moneo Atreides]]) in the fourth Dune book: ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''. Although the video game [[Harkonnen]] Mentat, [[Hayt De Vries]] was based on [[Piter de Vries]], Moneo was nothing like [[Thufir Hawat]] (except the uniform). Noree Moneo was energetic, more active.

Hayt
{{Original}}
[[File:300px-DuncanIdaho-RoadtoDune.jpg|thumb]]

'''Hayt''' was the name given to the first in a [[Duncan Idaho gholas|series]] of  [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]] produced by the [[Bene Tleilax]]. In Arabic, Hayt (حياة) means "Life."

Hayt was given as a gift to Paul Atreides, though, was secretly a tool intended to kill Paul. Paul knew this, and accepted it regardless. Though a ghola, Hayt was trained as a mentat, and exercised those abilities a number of times. During his time on Arrakis, he developed a love for Paul Atreides' little sister, Alia; who was having an inner conflict with the genetic remnant of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

Idaho shed this name when his original memories were restored during a deadly encounter with [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]] and the Tleilaxu [[face dancer]] [[Scytale]], after the death of Paul's concubine [[Chani Kynes|Chani]].

Trebor
{{encyclopedia}}
The eldest child of [[Ghanima Atreides/DE]] and [[Farad'n Corrino/DE]], described as a rusty-haired cherub. He was the delight of his parents and [[Leto II/DE]] and accompanied his father even into the privacy of his library. Ghanima saw his lighthearted existence as idyllic, compared to her turbulent childhood. Trebor was given more time than his younger siblings and remained LEto's favorite, the first of the many [[House Atreides/DE|Atreides]] stewards to serve him. When he was 16, [[Irulan Corrino/DE]] attempted to seduce him, infuriating his mother.<ref>Atreides, Ghanima</ref>

Ghanima Atreides/DE
{{encyclopedia}}
[[File:Ghanima2.jpg|thumb]]


(10208-10516) Remembered as "Our Lady and Mother Ghanima" was the twin sister and nominal wife of [[Leto II/DE|Leto II]], daughter of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] and [[Chani Kynes/DE|Chani Kynes]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
The twins were born thin, but healthy-looking. Their first few minutes of life
were spent crying and sipping at the [[Water of Conception]] by their godmother,
[[Harah/DE|Harah]].<ref name=chani>Atreides, Chani</ref>

Paul disappeared into the desert in 10209 AG, and with the twins still too young
to effectively rule, remained under [[Naib/DE|Naib]] [[Stilgar/DE]] and Harah's
guardianship in [[Sietch Tabr/DE]]. Their aunt Princess [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]]
became the Imperial Regent.<ref name=alia>Atreides, Alia</ref>
She and Leto shared both their external and internal environments, often
emulating the lives of their real parents, a "possession" game they eventually
found difficult to control. During one of these possessions Ghanima established
the bond with her mother that would become so important to her welfare.

Irulan was the twins' tutor and tried in her own way to show them affection. But
when Ghanima began speaking with the persona of her mother, she soon learned the
part that Irulan had played in Chani's death. When Ghanima was young the
Chani-persona still wished to be with Muad'Dib. After an initial period of
conflict the two women formed a coalition of support which lasted Ghanima's
lifetime.

The children were labeled "[[abomination/DE|abominations]]" by the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood, and though Ghanima was fearful of possession by one of
the memory lives she retained mastery of her own
personality all her life. According to Jessica's report to the Sisterhood, when
Ghanima was under stress, she could establish a state of constant hypnotic
suppression through the intercession of her mother, who leads the mohalata which
protects Ghanima.

Ghanima had loved Harah, but Alia, jealous of their relationship, separated them
when Ghanima was 3.

With [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Jessica Atreides]] in [[Castle Caladan]], and Stilgar content to defer
to her, Alia was in complete control of her twin nephews. They were [[pre-born]]
like her, they knew their capabilities and what large doses of
[[spice/DE|melange]] had done to their aunt and avoided it at all costs, fearing
the effects of the [[spice-trance]]. However she encouraged them otherwise,
hoping they would share with her the visions of prescience they could tap into.
Their lack of cooperation puzzled, annoyed and infuriated Alia.<ref name=alia/>

Their childhood was tumultuous and included assassination attempts kidnappings,
threats of possession, and threats of obliteration whenever Ghanima disagreed
with her Aunt.

Leto was presumed dead, and Ghanima who would ascend the throne, was to be
engaged to [[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Farad'n Corrino]].<ref name=alia/>

Jessica, Leto, Ghanima, Farad'n, even [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]] and [[Gurney Halleck/DE|Gurney Halleck]] planned against Alia in 10220. Idaho's death forced Stilgar to flee
to the desert with Irulan and Ghanima.<ref name=alia/>
===Imperium===
Her primary function in Leto's empire was to begin a breeding
program which united Houses chosen by Leto for their genetic characteristics:
[[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]], [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]], [[House Harkonnen/DE|House Harkonnen]], [[House Fenring/DE|House Fenring]], and [[Liet-Kynes]].

Ghanima settled into what some historians refer to as "a relatively normal adult
existence." She nominally married her brother at [[Sine]], and then resumed her
studies under the tutelage of the Atreides scribe and former Corrino prince
[[Farad'n Corrino/DE|Harq al-Ada]], her future loving companion. From him she
learned academic disciplines (neglected by both Alia and [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]]
in their instructions), and gained a love of history and philosophy, arts and
science which would sustain her throughout her long life.

Both she and al-Ada became patrons of the [[Imperium/DE|Imperium]]'s leading poets,
musicians, dramatists, and artists, establishing a renaissance in culture for
Leto's empire. In 10278, they discovered the work of [[Harq al Harba]] and
became his patrons for the next 30 years. Ghanima particularly liked his
comedies, while al-Ada served as consultant for the histories, and Leto
eventually declared him "Dramatist Laureate" for the Imperium.
Leto also initially participated
frequently in family events, until he removed himself to separate living
quarters during his transformation, but the family retained a large gathering
hall in which Leto could join them.

With Farad'ni Ghanima had 10 children: The oldest was [[Trebor]],
followed by the boys [[Lliwis]], [[Regor]], [[Tisamenus]]
and [[Boris]]. The years she was working with the Voices, she
gave birth to 3 children, [[Eleanor]], [[Helene]] and [[Elaine]], and as she found out much
later, all were named after the persona of her grandmother. [[Jeunne]] was named for Farad'n's [[Jeunne Corrino|sister]], and the
last was named [[Noree]], after a figure that haunted his dreams,
hoping to exorcise her.

The children were trained in academic disciplines and in [[prana-bindu]]
control. In Leto's peaceable kingdom, Ghanima and al-Ada feared a recurrence of
assassination attempts and wanted the children prepared to defend themselves:
The boys were given training in sword and knife attack and defense while the
girls were trained in the Bene Gesserit [[weirding way]] of hand-to-hand combat.
To balance their martial training, the children also perfected various creative
talents and skills, with family evenings of music and drama.

==Death==
In her final years she understood what Farad'n meant that he was tired. She felt
a stranger to Leto's world, and she felt more distant to him, and doubted about
his Golden Path, although she still believed in it. She finally decided to join
her ancestors and be submerged in someone else's consciousness; frightening, but
better than her life.

At her death, Leto declared a period of Imperial mourning, and from the urn
holding her water, he caused the voices of the Atreides to speak, convincing the
multitude of his godhead.
==Relationships==
===Farad'n Corrino===
With al- Ada she shared the children, their mutual work, and a highly
satisfactory relationship as friends and lovers.

In spite of their love for each other, Ghanima and al-Ada also established
separate sleeping quarters, owing to their different backgrounds. Ghanima's
quarters resembled Sietch Tabr with rugs and pillows that brought claustrophobia
to Farad'n, and incense that made him sneeze; al-Ada himself was more comfortable
among the antiques of his youth, old furniture with wood, glass and prickly
embroideries, which Ghanima found cold and sterile. Their rooms were adjoined by
then-mutual library and work rooms and separated from the nursery and schoolroom
areas by the general living and dining rooms. They often retreated to Jessica's
arboretum.

===Leto===
Ghanima shared a unique relationship with Leto. As children they spent hours
trying to come to terms with their overwhelming
abilities.

During Leto's transformation he stopped participating to their family activities
and afterwards could join them in the family's large gathering hall. She was
sympathetic to Leto's sacrifice which she would not dare to follow, and worried
about his suffering and attachment to [[Harum]]. The only person who could give
the love and compassion he so desperately needed as he gradually lost the
sensations of his human body, and spent many nights sitting with him in his
tower as when they were young. During her final years Leto wanted her with him
but she felt that they had less to speak of and felt that he was gone and
replaced by an ambitious entity she did not know.
===Chani===
The only other family woman whom Ghanima trusted besides Elaine seems to have
been the memory-persona of her mother Chani After an initial period of conflict
when Ghanima was young and the Chani-persona still wished to be with Muad'Dib,
the two women formed a coalition of support which lasted Ghanima's lifetime, and
protected her from being possessed by other memories.
===Children===
Probably the fact that neither Ghanima nor al-Ada had lived secure childhoods
led them to develop a close family framework in which their children could
flourish. For aristocrats, Ghanima and al- Ada spent a unusually considerable amount of
time with their children.

Though Ghanima enjoyed a loving relationship with all of the children, her
favorite was Trebor, who reminded them the lighthearted childhood they never
had, and her most frequent companion was Elaine.
===Alia===
Alia like Irulan had vied for control of the young Ghanima. Ghanima had loved
Harah, her surrogate mother, but Alia, jealous of their relationship, separated
them when Ghanima was 3. Ghanima was both terrified of and empathetic to Alia,
seeing her as a mirror of the possessed soul Ghanima could so easily become, and
in vain Alia attempted to persuade the twins to enter [[spice trance]] and share
visions.<ref name=alia/>

Though the rest of the family refused to speak of Alia after her waters had been
emptied on the sand, Ghanima taught her children about their aunt to show them
the problems and the pain of being human and in contact with one's active past.
===Irulan===
Irulan was the twins' tutor and tried in her own way to show them affection,
until Ghanima (through knowledge from her mother) learned the part that Irulan
had in Chani's death, and later was suspicious of her connections with the Bene
Gesserit ties and with [[Wensicia Corrino/DE|Wensicia]]'s assassination plot.
Even Farad'n seems to have had little affection for his aunt. Generally she felt compassion for her frustrations and fantasies. She did join the family for dinners and often accompanied the
group to picnics at Sietch Tabr.
She
remained friendly with Irulan for some 20 years, and encouraged her in
her literary pursuits.

However Ghanima would not allow her to tutor the children, stay out of her work room, and have living quarters separate from
the family. The
break came when Ghanima learned of Irulan's attempt to seduce the
16-year-old Trebor.

She considered that Paul couldn't stay with her more than a few minutes, and she
wrote stories for idiots about their love, while her lectures were ridiculous.
When Irulan retired to [[Wallach IX/DE]] both Ghanima and al-Ada were relieved.
===Jessica===
Her grandmother [[Jessica Atreides/DE]], was a rather remote figure who Ghanima
saw rarely. Farad'n's respect and affection for Jessica helped to strengthen
Ghanima's relationship with her grandmother, but Jessica spent most of her later
life on Caladan.

===Harq al-Harba===
Al-Harba enjoyed the help and the company of the royal family, but felt somewhat
out of place at court. Ghanima attended his rehearsals, and al-Harba let the
royal children play walk-on parts occasionally, much to their delight; she even
offered him a suite of rooms, which al-Harba refused.

A rumor says that Ghanima persuaded Harq al-Harba to write a masque which the
family produced privately for the court, each person proudly playing his or her
own role. Leto appeared, appropriately enough, as the voice of God. As the text
of this masque was not preserved, Harban scholars have argued that the story is
merely apocryphal.

==Works==
In her later life, Ghanima worked actively with her inner voices, producing the
extensive history of the Bene Gesserit, ''[[The Book of Voices]]'', as well as
an appendix, a collection of songs and poems from various Voices throughout
history. In the process of this work, Ghanima discovered the identity of her
paternal great grandmother — [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/DE]] — though recent discoveries show
the information was probably suppressed by Leto II for political and personal
reasons. At the instigation of Harq al- Ada she also contacted philosophers from
her past and, while he worked with the men, she produced a comprehensive
overview of women philosophers, [[The Women Who Knew the Good]]. Later in her
life she also produced her [[Commentaries to the Voices]], incisive analytical
reactions to the historical overview which she had developed during her original
investigations. Some of the poetry included in this work appears to be her own.

==Legacy==
Centuries later Ghanima was mainly a matter of legend, and the materials found at [[Dar-es-Balat]], were concrete proof that Ghanima existed.

Of the many documents dealing with Ghanima, [[The Book of Ghanima]] reveals the
most intimate record of her daily life. Recent linguistic and philological
analyses indicate that Volume One of the memoirs is in Ghanima's voice while
Volume Two is her daughter Elaine's.

==Biography==

Moneo had been trained in logic and pragmatism by masters. As an Atreides, he
had suffered no scrimping in his education. Despite his mother being a courtier of the God Emperor, he soon rebelled against him. He reasoned that humankind deserved
better than the tyrannic rule of a monster that was Leto. He decided that the
Imperial Godhead had to be eliminated.<ref name=moneo>Atreides, Moneo Ibn Fuad al-Lichna</ref>

===Rebellion===

[[File:Img159.jpg|thumb| Illustration by Klaus D. Schiemann]]

Moneo organized and planned a group of rebels dedicated to rid the universe from the monstrous God Emperor and allow humanity to choose their destiny. Thanks to his skills, they managed to achieve many small successes against him.
Lichna had long cautioned her wayward son about the futility of attempting to
escape his destiny as an Atreides; Moneo had chosen to disregard her words,
counting them as the mournings of a co-opted toady in the Imperial Service.

Disturbed by her eldest son's heresy, Lichna often discussed it with the God
Emperor. Of the hundreds of rebels Leto had seen, Moneo's exploits were a
source of entertainment and even genuine interest for him. It was his
initiative that made him consider Moneo as a replacement for his mother,
Lichna, unlike her 2 younger and more docile children. As Moneo employed his
skills against Leto, he was merely demonstrating to him the traits which would
eventually make him a competent administrator. All Lichna had to do was
advising him of the possible outcome of his actions.

In 13631 he managed to subvert a group of 25 [[Fish Speakers/DE]] from the
[[Onn]] garrison. When word of the traitors in their midst got back to the Fish
Speaker Command, their leaders did not give the traitors the usual option of
joining a death commando squad to atone for their sin, but executed them
secretly, in a private chamber beneath one of the Fish Speaker schools. Leto
himself, interested in Moneo's feats, covered his tracks, as himself attributed
his escape to good fortune.

In 13635 Moneo had managed to bribe, cajole, and blackmail his way to several
key [[Spacing Guild/DE]] personnel connected with the weather satellites
responsible for keeping the [[Sareer]] in its arid condition. In his
prescience, Leto could find no possible future where Moneo would ever be
capable in affecting the satellites's operations, but that movement alone
worried him, and decided not to chance the possibility of Moneo being outside
the scope of prescience, as [[Paul Atreides/DE|his father]] proved to be.<ref name=moneo/>

===Meeting with Leto===

As Lichna was approaching her time to retire, Leto finally decided to rein in
his wandering Atreides. After a roundup of the compromised Guild technicians
Moneo was summoned by Leto to his Citadel. Moneo was certain of what awaited
him after what his mother had warned him: to be tested in a trial tailored
individually to him, to be sensitized to the God Emperor's Golden Path, or be
left to die if found wanting.

Moneo was ushered by 3 hushed and terribly impressed young Fish Speakers to
Leto's presence, and was told that Leto knew every thing of his meaningless
charade those past years, until it stopped being entertaining. These remarks
intentionally made Moneo respond with a tirade of his own, damning Leto for
twisting whole genrations of humans without partaking of their humanity, until
he was exhausted. Then Leto peered out of his cowl and countered him with a
single furious question. "How dare you be offended by me?". Sliding from the
Royal Cart, he herded Moneo down into a cavern maze beneath the Citadel, and
abandoned him in its center with a bag of food and a vial of [[spice-essence]].

For more than a day, Moneo wandered though the twisting maze, eating sparingly
from his meager store and becoming more thoroughly lost with each passing hour.
The spice-essence was the only liquid provided to him, unless he found an exit
from the maze. The prospect of being exposed to he "[[inner voices|internal multitude]]" harbored by the Atreides was frightening to him more than dying of
thirst; but he also pondered that one of those memories might provide him with
directions for escaping the maze. The multiple possibilities tormented his
otherwise unengaged thoughts. After hours of confusion, he tossed off the
spice-essence, and it was not long before the effects came. He saw prescient
scenes of destruction, the end of humanity and the Golden Path that would avert
it, as well as the reason and necessity of Leto's being. When he came to himself, Moneo followed the
escape route to Leto's chamber where he was expected, certain that he would
obey him ever after, grateful for his sacrifice.<ref name=moneo/>

===Royal service===

Having entered [[Royal Service]], he lived with [[Rhiani]], a formed Fish
Speaker. Moneo was groomed over 19 years for his mother's administrating post,
given increasingly more responsible assignments to carry out for Leto, such as
maintaining an overall record of the farflung Fish Speaker garrisons, and
acting as Leto's intermediary with the [[Tleilaxu/DE]]. His mother stepped down
in 13654, and Moneo replaced her seamlessly in the workings of the Court, with
an impressive list of achievments, more than any of his predecessors.

In 13659 he uncovered a massive stockpile of [[spice/DE|melange]] on
[[Kaitain/DE]], largest such find made to that date. While representatives from
the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild arrived on the same errand, his agents
discovered its exact location only days before. in 13664, during a rebellion on
[[Shandor]], and as the majority of the Fish Speaker Command wanted a wholesale
slaughter as an example to other would-be heretics, Moneo managed to put it
down with minimal bloodshed.

In 13667, and despite of years of childlessness with Rhiani, he was surprised
when Leto informed him that he was needed as part of his breeding program. He
bid Rhiani an emotional farewell and reluctantly (which was the only breaking
from the God Emperor's will) and married [[Seyefa Nycalle]], a Fish Speaker many years
his junior.<ref name=moneo/>

Their child was [[Siona Atreides/DE|Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides]], who
lived with her parents in quarters near [[Leto's Citadel]]. Moneo was often accompanied with 
her on informal visits with Leto, held primarily on the [[Royal Road]]. She was sent to the Fish
Speakers school in Onn at 10 years old. Seyefa died the following year of fever with nobody to care for her, as Leto monopolized Moneo's time.<ref name=siona>Atreides, Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa</ref><ref name=moneo/>

During her time there, Siona started loathing Leto, blaming him for the death of her mother. Alarmed of her heretical conducts, it is said that Moneo secretly visited her to warn her that these would lead to her destruction.<ref name=siona/>

Moneo lavished on his daughter with anger and solicitude, unable to see his own
youth in hers, seeing her rebellion as a permanent and dangerous change. Leto
(who valued Siona for quite different reasons from those Moneo held) was amused
by Moneo's attitude and recognized the uselessness of attempting to steer her
every move. Moneo sometimes did not, and needed reminding.<ref name=moneo/>

Moneo was told by Leto that she was to be brought to him for the testing he gave all his future administrators. Moneo brought her to the [[Little Citadel]]. Her prepared Siona with a [[stillsuit/DE]] and left for Onn.<ref name=siona/>

In preparation to Leto's wedding to [[Hwi Noree]], Moneo sent Siona to [[Tuono Village]], along with Nayla and [[Duncan Idaho/DE]] to be as far as possible from Sietch Tabr. However the location was switched from Tabr to Tuono Village, giving them a chance to attack Leto.<ref name=siona/>

Leto's company, including Moneo, was trapped in the ambush staged by Siona. Early in the attack, Moneo lost his footing on the collapsing [[Royal Road]] bridge and plunged to his death, shortly to be followed by Hwi Noree and the Lord Leto.<ref name=moneo/>

==Personality==

During his rebellious years, his main objective was not to replace Leto with a
successor, not even himself, but just to rid humanity of Leto. He explained to
his followers that this would result to anarchy and chaos, but from that would
emerge a new race once again in control of its own destiny. His few successes
against the prescient God Emperor were a credit and testament of Moneo's
tremendous talents and skills.

As his servant, Moneo took great pride in his work, seeing his role of
majordomo as the best and most appropriate use of his talents. He was valued by the
God Emperor for the flawless way in which he kept the Court running, attending
all details, overseeing all arrangments that involved Leto's interest. His
incorruptibility earned Moneo a grudging admiration even among those who
attempted (and failed) to bribe or subvert him. Moneo desired only three things
in return for his labors: to enjoy the confidence of his ruler, to be allowed
to abstain from any further experience with melange, and to preserve a quiet
domestic life with Rhiani. His list of accomplishments was impressive even when
compared to those of his extremely competent predecessors.

By his final years Moneo was fanatic in his devotion
to Leto. Anyone who threatened the God Emperor, including Siona, threatened him personally.

Leto had once observed that Moneo was terrified of the idea of a world without
the God Emperor — that he would rather the than face such an existence.<ref name=moneo/>

Siona Atreides/DE
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Siona_atreides_by_dennyspringrain_darp31e-pre.jpg|thumb|Siona Atreides by Denny Springrain]]

Born as Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides, she was the daughter of [[Moneo Atreides/DE|Moneo Atreides]], the majordomo of [[Leto II/DE|God Emperor Leto II]], and [[Fish Speaker/DE|Fish Speaker]] [[Seyefa Nycalle]], his commanded breeding partner. She was the end of Leto's long experiment in human evolution. In her, Leto had created the means of humanity's continued survival and of his own destruction.<ref name=siona>Atreides, Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa</ref>

==Biography==

In her first years, she remained with her parents in quarters near [[Leto's Citadel]] until she was ten, provided with training by her parents that was the groundwork for the education she would receive from her Fish Speaker teachers, and from Leto himself. She often accompanied Moneo on informal visits, held primarily on the [[Royal Road]], avidly studying with curiosity and some religious awe the God Emperor, which amused him, as well as her evident ignorance of the fact that she was being studied in return.<ref name=siona/><ref name=moneo>Atreides, Moneo Ibn Fuad al-Lichna</ref>

===Training===

When she was 10 years old, she was admitted to the [[Fish Speaker]] school at [[Onn]]. Seyefa died a year later of fever, with no one to care for her.<ref name=moneo/> Siona would blame Leto for this, as she was taken away to school at his orders, while he monopolized Moneo's time. It was the earliest event that would lead to her rebellion against him.

Despite her grief, she performed well during her training. Though she was primarily under the control of her instructors and the older students, she continued to be influenced by her father, and Leto. Her instructors were ordered to give her special attention, which she hated. Her errors were never overlooked, and never received a gentle reprimand, unlike her fellow students, but was required to repeat the entire sequence. More than any other pupils, and despite some at the faculty feeling uncomfortable about closely skirting heresy, Siona was exposed to the [[Oral History]] and its many contradictions of the official "received" version of events.

Siona's moods shifted as she entered adolescence, becoming increasingly cynical and critical. By her fifteenth birthday, there were reports about her conduct that alarmed her father. He visited her in secret to warn her that her heretical mockeries would lead to her destruction. The [[Welbeck Fragment]] records that meeting, where Siona tells her father that Leto always kills those close to him, and she wonders how Moneo survived that long. 

During her last months at the school, Siona had made contact with outsiders from various walks of life, gingerly making advances in inquiry of potential insugents against the God Emperor's rule. Most were of [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] descent, or else scholars familiar with their history and lifestyle, and thus sorrowful over its passing at Leto II's hands.<ref name=siona/>

===Rebellion===

When she graduated, she organized a group of these like-minded rebels.  During the first three years of this network, Siona's group gathered intelligence. Her biggest assets were her proximity to [[Fish Speaker Command]], as well as her father, allowing her to know of appointments in the courtier's ranks, and maneuvered her friends accordingly. Furthermore, she was able to hide herself from Leto's prescience, enabling him to employ [[Ix/DE|Ixian]] electronic sensors, and informers.<ref name=siona/>

She often scolded her father for serving "the Worm." Moneo himself was in a difficult position professionally, and his warnings were scorned by her. Amused, Leto had plans for Siona, and insisted to Moneo that her struggle was "outside" him.<ref name=moneo/><ref name=siona/>

Eventually she came to think that violent action would be a necessity. In 13720, she gladly accepted [[Nayla/DE|Nayla]], a strong and dependable person, not knowing that she was Leto's spy.

After long inaction, in 13723, Siona led a raid on [[Leto's Citadel]] in the [[Sareer]]. Everyone but her found their deaths by Leto's [[D-wolves/DE|D-wolves]], but
she managed to steal [[Stolen Journals/DE|a pair of Leto's journals]] and the complete plans of the Citadel. Sions sent the books off to the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]], the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]], and the [[Ixians/DE|Ixians]] for attempted translation. 

As Leto did with his breeding stock, he allowed Siona some "vacation" with her rebellion, and after he allowed her to receive and read the translated books, he decided she was ready to be summoned back to his stock. Her father brought her to the [[Little Citadel]], and always worrying about her survival, he supplied her with a [[stillsuit/DE|stillsuit]]. Leto already knew that his preparations would be isufficient.<ref name=siona/> 

===Trial===

Her trial would be to walk with Leto in the desert of the Sareer to the Citadel for eight days.  Every night, she tapped at the front segment of Leto's pre-worm form, causing him to make a hammock of it for her.  On her way, Siona was ignorant of the stillsuit-usage, and wasted her breath keeping the face-mask down. Leto talked to her, arguing about his right to rule, mentioning that the Fremen never wasted their breath and its moisture. Only then Siona realized she had to seal her mask, on the morning of the third day.

As Leto knew, by the fifh day, and with no water, Siona was near death. Driven by thirst (and the still-urgent need to understand Leto) Siona underwent the second phase of her testing, and overcame her fears of the [[spice trance]]. Directed by Leto, she stroked the flaps of the cowl clung about his face. 

Drops of [[spice-essence]]-laced water fell to the surface of his skin, which Siona drank, and submitted herself into a ten-hour-long trance. This trance would reveal to her far more of the horrific future-that-might-be than anyAtreides other than Leto had ever beheld. The sight of those horrors sensitized her to the [[Golden Path]], and she survived the ordeal, thus fulfilling Leto's demand.

Three days later, they completed their journey. At the Citadel, Siona was given new clothes, refreshment, and a brief rest, during which time she did not speak to Leto, before the two of them returned to Onn.<ref name=siona/>

===The Fall===

Even the sight of those horrors had not convinced Siona that Leto had been right to initiate the Golden Path. The knowledge of this latest encroachment on her personal life enraged her. When her father sent her to Tuono Village with Nayla and Duncan Idaho, intending to keep her as far away as possible from the God Emperor's wedding procession with [[Hwi Noree/DE|Hwi Noree]] to [[Tabr]]. She left reluctantly, but then discovered that the ceremony's location had been switched to Tuono Village, giving her a chance to attack the God Emperor. As Leto and his company were traversing the Royal Road, her group ambushed them, and Leto, along with her father, fell from a massive bridge to their deaths.

Shortly after Leto II's death, Idaho destroyed the cell cultures from which the Duncan Idaho [[ghola/DE|gholas]] were produced, supposedly ensuring that he would be the last.

Siona's rebellion, however, required more than the death of a tyrant. Duncan Idaho helped her to reassign and control the new powers released, and channel the new forces. The two wed in 10728, using the ancient ritual from the Oral History. Over the coming decades, Siona bore nine daughters and two sons, all who carried her ability to disappear from prescient view. She was thus the first of the new [[House Atreides/DE|Atreides line]].

Siona Atreides ingested spice to prolong her life, something that Idaho refused, as he had lived more than he deserved through his gholas. He died in 13791, and Siona retired from public life on [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]]. She wrote her last book ''[[The Last Days]]'', and died at the age of 255 years.<ref name=siona/>

[[File:51JvVaUyVWL-1.jpg|thumb|War of Assassins]]

'''The War of Assassins of [[10187 AG]]''' was a large scale war fought between [[House Ecaz]] and [[House Moritani/XD|House Moritani]] (and in the latter part of the war, [[House Atreides]]) which led to the complete downfall and collapse of Moritani, and the awarding of their fiefs, wealth, and privileges to Ecaz.

===Events leading up to the war===
====Death of Wolfram Moritani====

The two Houses at the heart of the war had long been in feuding, most recently in [[War of Assassins of Houses Ecaz and Moritani|their first War of Assassins]] a decade previously. Tensions came to a head when Moritani passed an embargo on the [[Ecaz/XD|Ecaz]] homeworld, as the heir to House Moritani, [[Wolfram Moritani]], contracted an illness and disorder that caused him to physically waste away. The only cure for the ailment was [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Esoit-poay esoit-poay], which was only found on Ecaz. When Wolfram died from the disorder, his grieving father [[Hundro Moritani|Hundro]] vowed revenge on the enemy house.

====Assassination of Ilesa Ecaz====
House Moritani hatched a plan to assassinate the [[Archduke ]] [[Armand Ecaz]] and his daughter [[Ilesa Ecaz|Ilesa ]] at the ceremony of her wedding to [[Duke ]] [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]] of [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] in [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/10187_AG/XD?redlink=1&action=edit&flow=create-page-article-redlink 10,187 AG]. 

Duke [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Prad_Vidal Prad Vidal] of [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Elacca Elacca], a vassal of the Archduke and secret ally of House Moritani, cleverly disguised hexagonal blades on the sides of potted plants at the ceremony. As the Wedding March began to play, the sharply bladed discs began circling through the air, trying to strike their intended Ecazian targets, and [[Rivvy Dinari]] and [[Whitmore Bludd]] defended the Archduke and his daughter, respectively. Swordmaster Dinari sacrificed his life to save his master, however, that didn't protect Armand from losing an arm as one of the disks reached him.

Despite the efforts of Whitmore Bludd, one circling disc sliced Ilesa's carotid artery, and she bled to death. Moments after the tragedy, a holographic message of Viscount Hundro Moritani rang throughout the hall, claiming responsibility and thus starting the War.

Gurney Halleck/DE
'''Gurney Halleck''' (10135 AG - 10226 AG) was [[Warmaster]] for [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]] (in partnership with [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]]) during the reign of [[Leto I Atreides]], and then his son [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul]].

== Biography ==
Gurney was the eldest son of August and Oltora Halleck. The Hallecks were one of the Houses Minor of Chusuk (fourth planet of Theta Shalish) and were in the business of exporting musical instruments. Their craftsmen produced instruments of high quality; as a result, the Hallecks prospered from the sale of balisets, salleshorns, and lyriflutes to customers throughout the Imperium. Young Gurney, along with his brother Kyle and their younger sister, Annette, was trained from Ms earliest years in the manufacture and use of fine instruments, and was expected to take over the running of the family business when August retired. He developed a real talent for the baliset, and in 10134 approached his parents with the notion of hiring himself out to entertain one of the Houses Major. The attention attracted to their business, he argued, could only improve it; and he was rapidly becoming convinced that he was a much better musician than businessman.

It was a suggestion never to be acted on. In 10155, following a trumped-up declaration of charges against House Euterpe (rulers of Chusuk and longtime allies of the Atreides Dukes), House Harkonnen ordered an attack on Chusuk which left over a third of its industrial areas in ruins. More than fifty thousand captives were taken in the raid, Gurney and Annette Halleck among them. Ten times that number were killed, including every other member of the Halleck family.

This wave of murder and destruction was visited on the innocent people of Chusuk for two reasons. First, their siridar-governor was an Atreides ally: a strike against him was a strike against House Atreides, and a strike which could be made in greater safety than one directed against House Harkonnen's true enemy. Second, Chusuk was a small, relatively undefended planet; this made it the ideal place for Glossu Rabban, just entering his uncle's patronage, to conduct his first military action. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen had no intention of testing the boy-commander (Rabban was twenty-three at this time) against a world capable of fighting back.

Even at so early an age, Rabban's bent for cruelty asserted itself. After the attack, he personally reviewed the many prisoners and divided them into three groups. The first group, consisting of strong healthy men, was sent to the slave pits on Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld. Slave labor was one of the mainstays of that planet's economy, and Rabban knew that his contribution to the labor pool would be appreciated by the Baron. Halleck was one of these.

Women — but only young and attractive ones — made up the second group. These unfortunates were to be dispatched to the pleasure houses the Harkonnens provided for their troops; Halleck's sister, a strikingly beautiful girt of eighteen, was one of the first women chosen.

The third group was a small number of old people, children, and those generally unfit for inclusion in the ranks of laborers and prostitutes. These undesirables were put to the sword as Rabban watched.

Halleck spent the decade from 10155 to 10165 on Giedi Prime as a Harkonnen slave. In that brutal environment, where the average life expectancy of a worker was five years, the former musician managed to keep himself alive on the sheer strength of his hatred for his captors. His labor exceeded any the youth had ever known — slaves, for example, dug in the emerald mines outside the capital city of Harko sixteen hours a day, with Harkonnen Family holidays then' only rest — but he was toughened, not broken by it. At night while the otters lay exhausted, Halleck comforted himself by remembering the songs of Chusuk, songs of love and of the green planet he might never see again, and by composing new songs in his head.

Next to the work, the most dangerous threat to Halleck came from his fellow slaves. Given inadequate food and water, the survivors in the pits were those who learned to fight to defend their portion from the desperate and the greedy. Despite his early revulsion at the day-to-day violence, Halleck determined to survive; he learned to fight with the single-minded fervor be had once applied to learning to strum the baliset. And he never allowed himself to forget who had forced him to his new lessons.

In 10164, during his ninth year of captivity, Halleck again met the man responsible for the deaths of his family. Rabban, now appointed to govern Arrakis — where he was thought of as a monster — -in his uncle's name, was making a tour of the pits when Halleck was pointed out to him by one of the guards.

The Count was intrigued by the other man's tenacity — of those slaves captured in the Chusuk raid, only Halleck remained alive — and called him over for a personal inspection. Defying the guard's whispered instruction to avert his gaze while being scrutinized by the Count, Halleck stared directly into his enemy's face, with an expression of contempt too obvious to be ignored. The guard swung back his club, preparing to knock this insolent slave to the ground, but Rabban ordered him to hold. His curiosity piqued still further, Rabban demanded to know why Halleck was conducting himself so dangerously; didn't he realize, the Count asked, that he could be flayed alive for such disrespect? Halleck's answer was direct and to the point: he spat in his tormentor's face.

Rabban flew into a rage. Seizing an inkvine whip from the nearest guard, he ordered two other men to hold Halleck in place. Then, with a curse, he cracked the whip smartly along the line of Halleck's jaw. Rabban was denied the satisfaction of hearing Halleck scream as the whip hit. He had to content himself with watching the beet-red tattoo rise on the skin the inkvine had struck before he stormed off without completing the tour. Rabban did, however, remember to commute the death penalty for striking a Harkonnen; he said he wanted the slave to live to enjoy the caress of the inkvine.

One song, written during the years in the mines, (c. 10164) expresses the pain of slavery, of which the inkvine scar was only the visible reminder:

"Lost on Giedi's waste, lost in the wind's breath, Wounded by beasts and vines and blows and care, Waste world, Giedi, giving only pain and death, Pain and death, pain and death; but I bear, Though nights and days mix, slip, blend, I bear, as blood dries and hearts rend. Sleep blesses; my nightmares now my days, Days pace year-long where I live and cannot die; Where I die and cannot live, lost in ways Past help and hope, in the dark I lie. But I bear, bear and wait. It conies; I wait For the joys of home or the thrills of hate."

Somewhat less than a year later, House Atreides (in answer to yet another attack-of-provocation against an ally) sent a force against Giedi Prime itself. The killing of civilians, as well as undue damage to property, was for the most part avoided. Duke Leto Atreides knew the Harkonnen's soft spot and aimed directly at it: he ordered his troops to release and rescue every Harkonnen slave they could find. Halleck -was among those freed.

The former slaves were taken to Caladan, the Atreides fief, and given a choice. Those who had relatives, friends, homes on other worlds were free to contact them and arrange for passage back. Those who, on the other hand, lacked any other place to go or wished to begin anew were welcome to sign on with House Atreides. The Atreides, it was stressed, kept no slaves. Anyone who chose to join their service could be certain of being treated fairly, of being free to leave that service at any time (other than under conditions of war), and of Duke Leto’s loyalty in exchange for his own.

Halleck explained to the recruiting officer that he would be delighted to enter Atreides service, with one condition: that if he could locate Annette, and arrange her escape, he would be allowed to keep her with him. The officer readily agreed, but could offer Halleck little hope. He was too familiar with the practices inside the Harkonnen pleasure-houses to believe that Annette Halleck would still be alive after ten years, much less within reach of rescue.

in reach of rescue. In 10165, then, at the age of thirty, Halleck found himself embarked on a new career — soldiering. The fighting skills he had learned in the pits of Giedi Prime made a good foundation for his training in modem warfare and, when combined with his fanatic loyalty to his new liege, made him a terrifying man for an enemy to face in battle. His officers made note of him, commended him, saw to it that he was promoted; he had a place in Leto's military council by the time he turned forty. He was happy in his work, feeling that he had at last found the role for which he was ideally suited. He had even — slowly at first, then with increasing confidence when he saw that his playing was received well by his fellows — returned to the baliset. astonished at how much of his early raining he still remembered. Freed now to sing out the pain he had held in for so long, Halleck set to work. (With the later appointment of Duncan Idaho as Warmaster jointly with Halleck, he had more time for his music, and wrote down the songs composed in his mind in his years of slavery. As just two examples of his versatility, see his Desert Hymn and The Flaming Dames at the end of this essay.) 

ds over the years, Halleck was never able to discover what had become of his sister. In 10176, however, the answer came to him. A Harkonnen officer had made the mistake of taking an Atreides agent into his confidence and had explained a large facial scar as a souvenir of a girl in a pleasure-house on Larange, a planet in the same sector as Chusuk. The Harkonnen remembered the girl vividly after more than twenty years; she had seized the knife foolishly left on his belt and, after slashing at him, had fallen on it.

The agent, with Halleck's quest in mind, put out inquiries and found that the girl was undoubtedly Annette Halleck, and that the incident had occurred on her first day at the Harkonnen facility; she had at least been spared a life of brutalization. The agent then arranged for the Harkonnen officer involved to be implicated in the sale of some very important military secrets. The Harkonnen reputation being what it was, it could be safely assumed that the officer suffered considerably more before his death than had Annette Halleck.

All this was passed on to one of Halleck's aides, and thus to Halleck, on the eve of a battle in the Grumman campaign. Even seasoned veterans in the Atreides service spoke for many years of the ferocity with which Halleck led the following days' bloodbath against the Harkonnen forces.

The battle on Grumman was the first campaign in service for Duncan Idaho, a new recruit. Halleck was highly impressed by the young man's fighting and took him as a protégé. Idaho rose in the Atreides ranks even more quickly than his mentor had, becoming the House's swordmaster (responsible, with Halleck and Thufir Hawat, for the training of Paul Atreides) in 10182. By his time, Halleck had been appointed Warmaster, a post he shared equally with his former pupil by 10184.

In 10190, Halleck went to the desert planet Arrakis with Duke Leto — appointed governor — and the Atreides household. The HarkonnenSardaukar attack on Arrakis in 10191 followed. 

Halleck, along with the survivors of the force he commanded, joined forces with a group of smugglers. He lived and worked with this group for two years, believing that House Atreides no longer existed and that the Lady Jessica had betrayed both husband and son to the Harkonnens. Existing as he had in the pits on Giedi Prime — revenge his only motivation — Halleck subordinated his grief to his anger and bided his time, awaiting his opportunity to strike.

When his band was captured by Muad'Dib (the young Duke he had believed dead) in 10193, Halleck believed that his chance to avenge himself on the traitor had been given, him. He seized Lady Jessica at knifepoint shortly after his arrival at the Cave of Birds and demanded she confess her treachery to Duke Leto. Only Paul's explanation regarding the way Dr. Yuen's Imperial Conditioning had been broken convinced Halleck that he had erred.

After this incident, and Lady Jessica's instant forgiveness, Halleck was her most obedient servant. When the Lady returned to Caladan in 101%, he asked for and received permission to accompany and guard her.

Scholarly opinion concerning Halleck's relationship With Lady Jessica after their return to the Atreides's old fief is divided. In The Errant Sister, the most exhaustive biography of the Lady yet discovered, researcher Chatan S. Meed advances the theory that the two became lovers before their departure for Caladan. White Us case is logically built, and his evidence sound — quotations from letters written by the Lady Jessica to Princess Irulan, for example, in which she refers to Halleck as "my most beloved friend" and makes her affection for the man quite obvious — it is entirely possible that the friendship between Halleck and his liege-lady was no more than a bond between companions who had suffered and triumphed together for many years and wished to share a quiet retirement. It should also be noted that Leto II mentions no such intimacy between the two in his version of the Atreides family history and that he, other than any but the Lady or Halleck, could best confirm its existence. Until more concrete evidence to the contrary can be uncovered, caution decrees that rumor should be ignored and their comradeship be considered exactly that.

In 10218, Halleck was again on Arrakis, having accompanied Lady Jessica on her journey to discover the true condition of her daughter Alia, and her grandchildren Leto and Ghanima. Evidently she had revealed to him her knowledge that Alia had succumbed to Abomination, and her terror that her grandchildren might be similarly afflicted. On her orders, Halleck' arranged for the capture of Leto II, then a boy of nine, and subjected him to the boy's own version of the test-mashad (the Fremen expression for a trial which is either passed honorably or not survived; a test of the soul). Leto's test consisted of being observed and questioned before, during, and after his exposure to large doses of melange: it was believed that the spice-trance the drug induced had led Alia into possession; any indication that Leto would follow the path she had taken would require his death.

To assist him in conducting the test — and, perhaps more importantly, to kill the boy should it prove unavoidable — Halleck had taken a Fremen named Namri, father of one of Alia's chief priests. Only when the test was nearing its conclusion did Halleck learn that Namri's true alliance was with Alia, and that the instructions and notes from "Lady Jessica" had in reality been forged by her daughter. Namri, after revealing himself, discovered that Halleck was not the soft, easily bettered off-worlder the Fremen thought, and paid for his mistake with his life.

Had Namri but lived to see it, Halleck's next action would have astonished him even more: donning the slain Fremen's robes for disguise, Halleck walked into the desert, called a worm, and rode it to Tuck's Sietch on the inner lip of False Wall.

As soon as possible after his arrival at the sietch, Halleck stole a 'thopter and used it to escape to one of the small rebel sietches at Gara Rulen. He was met there by Leto who wore what Halleck believed to be an odd type of stillsuit (it was actually the sandtrout skin the boy had made his own) and led the blind man known as The Preacher.

The Bene Gesserit training which Lady Jessica had given him during their years on Caladan convinced Halleck of two things: that Leto spoke the truth when he denied being possessed, and that The Preacher was, as had been rumored, Paul Muad'Dib Atreides. On the basis of those truths, Halleck agreed to return to Arrakeen with Leto and his father.

His presence there could not prevent Paul's being killed denouncing his sister to an angry crowd, tat Halleck felt no guilt. Years of association with the Atreides, combined with the teachings of his mistress, had shown Halleck how little the actions of an individual mattered in the face of history — or of legend.

Leto II, immediately after his assumption of the throne, sent Halleck as his advisor in Stilgar's Council at Sietch Tabr. A faithful servant of House Atreides to the end, he performed this function until his death in 10226.

in 10226. His demise marked the passing of the last of the original Duke Leto's advisors and his funeral was conducted with the ceremony and respect generally reserved for those of a much higher caste. Lady Jessica made one last trip back from Caladan to pay her respects to her loyal servant and friend, and the emperor himself presided over the rites. Following the public service, Halleck's body was taken to Sietch Tabr for the private Fremen ceremony he had requested. The water counters representing his water were given to Leto 11, who is (believed to have kept them among his most prized possessions throughout his long life.

Thufir Hawat/DE
[[File:Thufir.jpg|thumb|Thufir Hawar -Illustration by Moebius]]

==Early life==

(10075-10196). '''Thufir Hawat''', 
who many believe was the greatest 
[[Mentat]] of the [[Imperium]], was born the 
first of nine children to [[Golani]] and 
[[Alwidi Hawat]] on [[Logi]], third planet of 
[[Alpha Centauri B]].
Hawat's mother Golani, herself 
briefly trained as a potential mentat, 
recognized the capability in her infant 
son and took the proper steps to begin 
his training. Golani scoured the 
Imperium for experts in muscle and 
mind control, and in sharpening the 
sensitivities and the awareness; and for
teachers of [[languages]] and the physical 
and biological sciences. She sought to 
have her son well grounded not only in 
the fundamentals customarily given a 
potential mentat, but also in economics, 
communications, and [[military]] strategy.
When informed of his potential 
and given his options, Thufir chose to 
continue his training and was sent to an 
eminent school for Mentats on [[Ix]]. 
There, Thufir soon made two 
significant attachments. The first was 
to [[Kolinar]], whose wit and charm 
immediately attracted Thufir; the two 
young men quickly became inseparable 
friends. The second was to the young 
woman [[Anyya]] with whom Thufir fell, 
for the first and last time in his life, in 
love. The daughter of a [[Bene Gesserit]] 
and an official of the [[Imperial court]], 
the highly intelligent Anyya rivaled 
Thufir in scholastic accomplishments 
and returned his affection. By all 
accounts they shared for years a happy 
and fulfilling relationship.
The reports are notably sketchy, 
however, on the end of their affair. We
do know that Anyya left Ix suddenly 
with Kolinar and is never referred to 
again in any of the Hawat papers. 
[[Rouse]], the Mentat for [[House Dioscuri]] 
and Thufir's lifelong friend, reports (in 
his book, [[The Education of a Mentat]]) 
Thufir's moroseness following Anyya's 
departure, his adamant refusal to speak 
of her, and a cryptic remark Thufir 
made about this time, "The female of 
the species is without doubt incapable 
of fidelity." Seemingly, it was [[Camelot]] 
come again, but with a difference: 
rather than rising above his affliction to 
an [[Arthur]]ian strength that could infuse 
his soul with iron, Thufir allowed his 
pain to debase his love for Anyya into a 
corrosive hate and to generate a deep, 
and lifelong, mistrust of all women, 
especially those connected with the 
Bene Gesserit. This anathema 
undoubtedly accounts for the fact that 
Thufir never again became seriously 
involved with a woman.

==In service of Duke Mintor==

By the time Thufir Hawat was 
ready at age thirty-five to join [[House 
Atreides]] on [[Caladan]], be was the most 
superbly trained Mentat in the 
Imperium. The robust [[Duke]] [[Mintor 
Atreides]] had a vitality that promised to 
test Hawat's powers to their utmost. 
Determined to develop fully the fief his 
family had held for twenty generations. 
Duke Mintor challenged Hawat to 
solve his expansion problems. 
Accordingly, Hawat surveyed the 
Duke's lands, directed the construction 
of dams to control goods and complex 
irrigation systems, and designed 
efficient transportation and 
communication networks. He searched 
the Imperium for experts in agriculture, 
viticulture, [[animal]] husbandry, and
mining to serve as a faculty in the 
schools he founded. Armed with
Hawat's plans, the Duke's thoroughly 
trained subjects produced record crops 
and quality [[wine]]s, propagated top-
quality cattle and farm animals, and 
developed lucrative mines. Duke 
Mintor's flourishing estates, literally 
the creation of Hawat's energy and 
expertise, became the envy of the 
Imperium.
The Duke's absolute fairness and 
honesty in all his dealings with Hawat 
(traits also seen later in Leto) aroused 
in the Mentat an abiding affection and 
admiration. One source suggests that 
the Duke was personally responsible 
for rescuing two of Hawat's loved ones 
from [[Harkonnen]] oppression. Although 
documentation of the details of this feat 
is lacking, the Duke's daring and 
courage must have endeared him to his 
Mentat. It is, thus, not surprising that 
before Hawat had been with Duke 
Mintor many years he almost literally 
gave his life for his Duke. In a skirmish 
with offworld raiders at one of the 
Duke's ranches, Hawat, dodging to 
escape a [[sword]] slash in the groin, took 
it instead in his left leg. He bore the 
scar, and the occasional pain, with 
pride.
Hawat's regard for his Duke, a 
[[bullfighting]] addict, led him to develop 
an extensive bull-breeding program. 
Using his abilities to analyze genetic 
qualities, Hawat set up breeding farms 
and outlined feeding and nutritional 
experiments. He also designed a new 
arena for the Duke, supervised its 
construction, and took charge of the 
colorful pageantry known as the 
Atreides Tourney. Since Hawat never 
missed a [[corrida]] in which the Old Duke 
took part, he was present the day a 
great bull caught the Duke on his 
horns.

==In service of Duke Leto==

After the Old Duke's death, 
Hawat transferred his allegiance to 
[[Duke Leto]] who turned his attention 
from his well-run estates to concentrate 
on espionage, defense and the 
expansion of his sea and air power. 
Hawat served his Duke brilliantly in 
every interest: military, political, 
economic, social and personal. In fact, 
it was Hawat who investigated the 
Bene Gesserit school and [[Jessica]] 
before reluctantly having her escorted 
to Caladan to be Duke Leto's 
concubine. He became even more 
useful after [[Paul]] was born. Suspecting 
that his son might have mental 
capabilities, Leto gave Hawat the 
responsibility of selling up Paul's 
intensive training program. During 
these intimate years of Paul's infancy 
and childhood, Hawat came to love the 
boy as his own son. This love endured 
to — and manifested itself 
magnificently on — his dying day.

==On Caladan==

The best way perhaps to 
appreciate Hawat's value to House 
Atreides is to review his contributions 
during the move from Caladan to 
[[Arrakis]], a fief that had been held by 
ancient enemies of the Atreides: the 
Harkonnens. The logistics involved in 
moving personnel and materiel from 
one [[planet]] to another were appalling, 
but Leto was confident the task was not 
beyond his Mentat. In record time, his 
confidence was confirmed.
An even more difficult job was 
securing the settling of the new capital 
at [[Arrakeen]], especially when all of 
Hawat's calculations warned him of the 
high probability of Leto's losing 
Arrakis to the disgruntled Harkonnens. 
In preparation, Hawat made himself an 
authority on Arrakis; he gathered and 
digested every scrap of knowledge
available on geography, topography, 
climate, weather and history, as well as 
on the [[Fremen]] and their culture. After 
the move he sent out trained teams of 
observers to augment his information.
Two immediate concerns were 
communications and military strategy. 
Hawat set up the Duke's own 
communications network and enlarged 
the codes, especially the Atreides hand 
signs and battle language: his creations. 
He deployed the troops, efficiently 
dividing the guards between the 
[[Governor]]'s Mansion and the landing 
field. For future use, he assembled 
dossiers OB suspected Harkonnen 
sympathizers.
The most sensitive area was 
security. Hawat spent sleepless days 
and nights checking every room and all 
the furnishings of the Residency. He 
set up [[shields]], placed safety devices, 
cleared the servants, and personally 
installed the [[poison snooper]]s. Hawat 
had made security the core of his 
instruction to the young Leto, and later 
the young Paul:, "The cost of survival 
is eternal vigilance." However, despite 
all his care, a [[hunter-seeker]] placed by a 
traitor after Hawat had inspected Paul's 
room threatened Paul's life shortly after 
the move into the Residency. When, in 
an agony of remorse, he tried to resign,
Hawat was reminded that Paul 
had survived largely through Hawat's 
own training. Leto felt he was more to 
be commended for Paul's readiness 
than blamed for his ignorance of an 
"internal" traitor, whose presence no 
one — from Duke Leto and the Lady 
Jessica down to the lowliest [[trooper]] —
up to this moment had suspected. 
Leto's faith in his Mentat, revealed in 
his refusal to accept Hawat's
resignation, refueled Hawat's 
unfaltering loyalty to House Atreides.
Himself an expert in sabotage 
and counter-sabotage, Hawat ferreted 
out many a Harkonnen intrigue. He 
may have deplored the need, but he did 
not hesitate to use bribes, deceit, or 
even murder if service to his Duke 
called for them. From experience, 
Hawat had become eternally 
suspicious. As Duke Leto once said of 
him, "He sees [[assassin]]s in every 
shadow."
Perhaps Hawat's most significant 
service to the Atreides was his acute 
assessment of the Fremen. Using the 
data [[Gurney Halleck]] brought him, 
Hawat shrewdly saw that previous 
estimates of the Fremen population 
were ridiculously low. And, once he 
began to learn the qualities of the 
desert people, he knew without a doubt 
that they were a potential corps of 
fighters as strong and as deadly as the 
[[Sardaukar]].
Hawat did extensive research 
and prepared [[filmclip]]s on the Fremen 
culture. His first analysis of the Fremen 
[[religion]], which familiarized Leto and 
Paul with such terms as "[[Mahdi]]" and 
"[[Lisan al-Gaib]]," embodied all the 
essentials. The old Mentat quickly 
grasped Fremen ways and seemed 
especially sensitive in recognizing their 
concerns: as, for example, their 
preoccupation with water reclamation, 
their reticence with strangers, their 
passion for freedom, their obsession 
with exclusivism. His advice to Duke 
Leto was sound when he urged caution 
in commandeering the Desert [[Botanical Testing Stations]] lest the action 
antagonize the Fremen for whom the 
bases had some deep significance. 
Hawat also realized that the [[Guild]]'s
refusal to allow the Atreides to orbit a 
[[weather satellite]] was based not on 
financial considerations but on their 
fear of an Atreides' discovery of 
Arrakis's true value. The accuracy of
his foresight was subsequently 
substantiated when the extensive 
Fremen colonization, the staggering 
potential wealth of the planet's [[spice]] 
and the beginnings of the [[Kynes]]-
inspired ecological transformation 
became known.
Once established at the capital, 
Hawat made only one error his 
readiness to believe the Lady Jessica a 
traitor — a belief born no doubt of his 
distrust of women, especially a Bene 
Gesserit "[[witch]]." Although the 
Harkonnens had left Arrakis, they had 
no intention of turning the fief over to 
the Atreides. Knowing Hawat's 
vigilance, the Harkonnen Mentat [[de Vries]] arranged to feed Hawat false 
information in an intercepted letter 
implicating Jessica. Even when Duke 
Leto refused to believe the Baron's 
letter and Jessica logically defended 
herself against the charge, Hawat could 
not eradicate his suspicion: the bitter 
fruit of Anyya's betrayal. Aware of his 
problem without knowing its cause, 
Jessica warned Hawat that, although he 
could brilliantly apply logic to anything
outside himself, he had difficulty with 
"those things most deeply personal." 
Unconvinced, Hawat nevertheless left 
the interview with a "sense of supreme 
admiration" (as he wrote to Rouse) for 
the Lady Jessica, who at one point had 
with remarkable courage defied 
Hawat's [[knife]] by turning her back on 
him.
Except for this one mistake, 
those days when Hawat labored to 
establish his beloved House Atreides
on Arrakis were the last fine hours for 
the aging Mentat; indeed, they may 
have been his finest. From the moment 
he heard the news of the Harkonnen 
attack, bitterness became his daily 
companion. Having prepared for 
random raids or an attack of no more 
than ten [[brigade]]s (the number Hawat's 
[[intelligence corps]] warned him to 
expect), Hawat was staggered by the 
size of the Harkonnen force and their 
strategic deployment. A rapid 
calculation revealed the attack 
consisted of more than one hundred 
brigades. The entire spice income of 
Arrakis for fifty years could not have 
covered the cost of such a venture. 
What Hawat could not possibly know 
was that much of the cost had been 
paid from the Imperial coffers.
From that moment until the day 
he died, Hawat was convinced that the 
Lady Jessica had been their betrayer. 
One can only conjecture that his 
experience with Anyya, which must 
have been devastating, continued to 
cloud his judgment of women. 
Although helpless himself to assist his 
Duke as the Harkonnens advanced, 
Hawat was heartened by the 
unbelievable Fremen capture of an 
[[ornithopter]] manned by [[Sardaukar]] and a 
kamikaze destruction of a [[troop carrier]] 
before he was captured by Sardaukar 
disguised in Harkonnen [[livery]].

==In service of the Baron Harkonnen==


In Baron Harkonnen's papers (in 
an Appendix to House Harkonnen) we 
learn of the Baron's delight that not 
only was Thufir Hawat, Duke Leto's 
[[Master of Assassins]], taken alive, but 
also that he could be used against the 
Atreides. The Baron's strategy was 
simple: by allowing Hawat to believe 
Jessica was alive and never revealing 
that [[Dr. Wellington Yueh]] was the true
betrayer, the Baron could feed Hawat's 
desire for revenge. The Baron 
summarized: "The way to control and 
direct a Mentat is through his 
information. False information — false 
results."
Much as he wanted a Mentat 
after Piter de Vries was dead at Leto's 
hands, the Baron had too much healthy 
fear of Hawat not to lake some 
precautions: he instructed [[Iakin Nefud]], 
his [[guard]] [[captain]], to impregnant 
Hawat's body with the [[residual poison]] 
developed by de Vries and to 
administer the antidote regularly in the 
Mentat's meals. Without the antidote, 
Hawat would die within a few days.
Hawat's scantily recorded career 
on [[Giedi Prime]] remains enigmatic. His 
actions seem, on the one hand, to be 
depraved, and yet, on the other, to 
mask perhaps some plan of his own to 
destroy the Baron. One of Hawat's less 
worthy projects was a perverted 
alteration of the jousting techniques he 
had developed in the old days in Duke 
Mintor’s bullrings: two such 
adaptations were [[abstractor]]s to be 
carried by Harkonnens in The
[[Gladiator]] Games and crippling 
handicaps for their slave opponents. 
Hawat also devised a plan whereby 
[[Feyd-Rautha]] could give a spectacular, 
albeit rigged, performance before an 
elite audience. Instead of being 
[[drug]]ged as was usual with [[slave]]-
gladiators, the victim was conditioned 
by Hawat to be overcome by a key 
word. Thus, it would appear that Feyd-
Rautha had brilliantly defended himself 
against an undrugged slave who had 
been slipped into the arena to kill the 
[[na-Baron]]. The plot would not have' 
been so despicable had it been only to 
glorify an egotistical young man, but
its true purpose was to eliminate the 
Baron's [[slavemaster]], who would 
necessarily be blamed for the 
undrugged slave. Possibly Hawat 
hoped to use fee evil to accomplish his 
good — because the slave came within 
a hairsbreadth of besting the Baron's 
nephew.
Another puzzle is Hawat's role in 
Feyd-Rautha's assassination attempt on
the Baron. Knowing the Baron's 
preference for boys, Hawat conspired 
with Feyd-Rautha to send the Baron a 
beguiling slave boy with a [[shielded  needle]] planted in his thigh. And yet, 
Hawat warned the Baron before the 
assassination could take place. The 
Mentat seemed to be playing both ends 
against the middle for some game of 
his own.
Hawat's mysterious and 
sometimes ambiguous behavior while 
in Harkonnen service can best be 
explained in the light of his intense 
loyalty to House Atreides. Given the 
depraved Baron Harkonnen’s method 
of operation — to tic subordinates, 
from whom he shrewdly knew he could 
never expect loyalty, to him through 
some devious means — Hawat could 
count on no less. With his Mentat 
powers he most certainly knew, or at 
least suspected, that he had been 
poisoned and lived- only as long as it 
was the Baron's whim to administer the 
antidote. Burning, nay obsessed, with 
the desire for vengeance on the 
enemies of his beloved Atreides, Hawat 
walked the path of expediency; he 
complied with the Baron's orders, 
joined his conspiracies, designed his 
plots, no matter how nefarious — all to 
one dedicated end: the glorious day he 
could strike the annihilating blow
against those who had crushed his 
cherished House.
We can only wish we had more 
evidence covering these years. Except 
for some notes of the Baron and some 
fragments of letters Hawat sent to his 
old school friend Rouse, little else has 
been unearthed. In one of his notes, the 
Baron boasts that he had succeeded in 
aiming Hawat's attention and 
vengeance against the [[emperor]] by 
convincing him that the emperor was 
the cause of the House Atreides' 
destruction. Hawat still hated the Baron 
with a "casual" hate, but "he thinks he 
uses me," the Baron wrote, "to wreak 
his revenge upon the emperor.... He 
does not think beyond his revenge. 
Hawat's a man who must serve others, 
and doesn't even know this about 
himself." Hawat's letters to Rouse, 
however, seem to contradict the 
Baron's view. One letter declared that 
Hawat "loathed" the Baron; another 
called him "a gross and dangerous pig" 
and avowed that "destroying him [the 
Baron] will be a service to mankind." 
How Hawat planned to destroy the 
Baron is not clear. That it involved 
Arrakis seems certain, for in one of his 
last services for the Baron, Hawat 
directed the Baron's attention to the 
desert planet.
Hawat revealed to the Baron that 
the emperor had turned against Duke 
Leto primarily because Leto had 
trained a fighting force to rival the 
Sardaukar; he then told the Baron that 
the emperor suspected Harkonnen 
emulation of the Duke's feat with the 
Fremen. When the Baron doubted, 
especially because of the Fremen lack 
of numbers, Hawat convinced him that 
the Fremen population could easily be 
in excess of ten million. Hawat also
suggested that — if it could be done 
without alerting the emperor — the 
Fremen could indeed be trained into an 
awesome force. What he did not tell the 
Baron was that Gurney Halleck had 
survived the treacherous Harkonnen 
attack on House Atreides and that he 
received reports from Halleck on
Fremen battle tactics. Thus, the 
scheming most likely pivoted on 
Hawat's desire to lure the Baron to 
Dune — where Gurney had many 
hands to help him earn his revenge.
Fate, however, stepped in to lure 
more than the Baron to Arrakis. The 
Guild, alarmed by the changes they had 
observed on the planet — especially 
the increased tempo in troop activity 
brought about by Paul Muad'Dib — not 
only relayed this information to the 
throne, but also reduced troop transport 
fares to a minimum. Thus, in a short 
time the skies above Arrakis held the 
seven-ship fleet of the Harkonnens in 
company with the emperor's five 
legions of Sardaukar.

==Return to Arrakis and Death==

As soon as the Guild gave the 
Harkonnen troops permission to land, 
the Baron sent Hawat to a [[smuggler]] 
base with orders to infiltrate the camp 
of the infamous Fremen Muad'Dib. 
Hawat was well away from Arrakeen 
then when the mysterious Muad'Dib 
defeated the Sardaukar and captured 
the emperor with all of his retainers. 
When he returned to Arrakeen more 
than five days later, weak and already 
moving toward death from lack of fee 
antidote, Hawat discovered not only 
that the Baron was dead, but that the 
invincible Muad'Dib sitting in state in 
the Residency was none other than his 
young Duke Paul. Certainly he 
reproached himself when he learned 
that the Lady Jessica, alive and with
her son, was not Paul's betrayer, but, 
like himself, a victim of a devious 
Harkonnen plot and of the treason of 
Dr. Yueh.
When the Padishah Emperor and 
the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] summoned him shortly before 
the captives went to their audience with 
Paul, Hawat knew it meant treachery. 
He accepted the tiny poisoned needle 
without a word,- too weak to nod his 
head as the emperor commanded him 
to use it against the "upstart Duke." 
When he saw Gurney Halleck checking 
the entourage entering the Great Hall 
for weapons, Hawat used the old hand 
signs to tell him that, thinking Paul was 
dead, he had been working with the 
Harkonnens and to request that he be 
left with me group — to avert, no 
doubt, any move that might be made 
against Paul.
And then Paul called him out 
and greeted him as "old friend." As
Hawat obeyed his beloved Duke for the 
last lime, he surely knew that Paul was 
aware of the needle and certain that 
Hawat had no intention of using it 
against him. In her account of the 
scene, the [[Princess Irulan]] writes that 
Paul and Hawat whispered together for 
a few moments before Paul reached out 
to support Hawat by the shoulders. And 
then, she records, Hawat turned in. a 
magnificent gesture to face the 
emperor, extended his left hand, palm 
up, to expose the needle cupped against 
his fingers, and said, "See, Majesty? 
See your traitor's needle? Did you think 
that I who've given my life to service to 
the Atreides would give them less 
now?" With that last act of supreme 
defiance proclaiming his inviolable 
loyalty to the Atreides, Hawat sagged
in death against Paul and slumped to 
the floor.
Hawat's Duke then paid his 
faithful servant, the Mentat who had 
served three generations of Atreides, 
his final honor: he gave, the order to 
have Hawat's body carried away and 
treated with all the respect of a hero of 
the tribe.

'''Paul Atreides''' is the main character of the 2021 film ''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]''. He is the son of [[Leto Atreides I/2021 film|Duke Leto Atreides]] and [[Jessica Atreides/2021 film|Lady Jessica]]. Paul is portrayed by [[Timothée Chalamet]].

Born on the planet Caladan, Paul begins experiencing vivid visions of the future in the form of dreams, including an attack on [[Arrakis]], and a yet-to-come relationship with [[Chani Kynes/2021 film|Chani Kynes]].

== Character description ==
''The son of a great man and royal heir to the noble House Atreides, young Paul has spent his entire life being prepared for the greatness that comes with his family’s name. Haunted by visions of a mysterious girl and an inevitable future, he is called to leave his childhood homeworld behind for a new life on the most dangerous planet in the Known Universe, where he must confront his innermost fears if he is to realize his true destiny.''<ref>https://www.dunemovie.com/</ref>

== History ==
===Early History===
Paul is the only son and heir of Duke Leto of [[House Atreides]] and his concubine Lady [[Jessica Atreides/2021 film|Jessica]]. Paul was raised on the planet [[Caladan]], training under the influence of high ranking Atreides soldiers and family friends,  [[Gurney Halleck/2021 film|Gurney Halleck]], [[Duncan Idaho/2021 film|Duncan Idaho]], and [[Thufir Hawat/2021 film|Thufir Hawat]]. 

Given his mothers role as a member of the [[Bene Gesserit]], Paul received training from her on the ways of the organisation, but also on the ability to use the [[Voice]]. Despite Paul's advanced training, he often found it difficult to control The Voice and therefore, was not as advanced as his mother had hoped.

===Eagerness and doubts===
When House Atreides is given stewardship of [[Arrakis]], a vast planet home to the most valuable substance in the universe, [[Spice Melange]], Paul is desperate to visit the planet with Duncan Idaho, and begs his master to take him with him. Idaho refuses, citing that it is no place for him yet, but also that he would be court-marshalled for breaking Leto's rules. 

Paul is reluctant to let the matter rest, however, and talks directly with his father about the matter. Leto refutes Paul, citing that he must be protected as the only heir of Atreides, but also that he will become more involved with the running of [[Caladan]] during this time. Paul shares his concerns with inheriting the role of Duke, but his father remarks that he will always be the most important thing: his son.

Paul becomes confused and inquisitive when he begins having dreams of a girl within the desert. The recurrent dreams present themselves as visions to Paul, and he believes that he is seeing the future. It quickly becomes clear that the visions are set on the Arrakis, which makes Paul — and those around him — more inquisitive. 

===Treatment by the Bene Gesserit===
Shortly after he is denied travel to Arrakis, Paul is woken during the night by his mother, who reveals that the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/2021 film|Gaius Helen Mohiam]] has heard of his dreams and come to visit him. She explains the importance of the visit and asks Paul to comply with her every wish, to which he agrees. Before entering the room to meet with Mohiam, he is warned by Yueh — the Suk Doctor — that the Bene Gesserit have their own ulterior motives therefore he must be wary of them.

Seconds after their meeting, Paul becomes wary of Mohiam when she dismisses Jessica, citing that it is rude for her to be dismissed in her own home, but Mohiam simply remarks that she was once Jessica's teacher. Mohiam subjects Paul to a test under the [[Gom Jabbar]], which he graciously passes with ease. Mohiam is surprised, but nonetheless impressed. 

Paul questions the Bene Gesserit's motives further when he overhears a conversation between Mohiam and his mother in which they talk about the [[Lisan al Gaib|The One]], a prophesied son that will bring peace to the universe. Jessica explains that the Bene Gesserit has been manipulating bloodlines for centuries to bring about The One, but that some believe he has already arrived.

===Arrival on Arrakis===
Shortly after their arrival on [[Arrakis]], Paul is invited along with his father, Leto, on a tour of the spice harvesting operations upon the desert planet. They are accompanied by [[Liet Kynes/2021 film|Liet-Kynes]], the judge of change. They witness a harvester circling the desert harvesting spice, but are made aware that large [[sandworm]]s are attracted to the rhythmic thumping caused by the harvesters. Paul and Leto are concerned, however, when the equipment on a [[carryall]] fails and the harvester cannot be lifted to safety.

Leto orders as many men to be saved from the harvester as possible, but when Paul leaves the ornithopter to help, he begins experiencing hallucinations due to the vast amount of spice within the air. His hallucinations present themselves in the form of the [[Fremen]] girl he has been seeing for weeks. Paul is dragged back aboard the ornithopter just in time before the sandworm ravages the harvester. 

===Atreides is usurped===
Paul faces further dangers when House Atreides is betrayed by none other than [[Wellington Yueh/2021 film|Dr. Yueh]], who disables the shield surrounding Arrakeen and jams Atreides' communications. Paul is taken hostage along with [[Jessica Atreides/2021 film|Jessica]] by Harkonnen soldiers. Below them, Arrakeen is ravaged by a hoard of Harkonnen and [[Sardaukar]] soldiers.

Whilst the Harkonnen men plan to drop Paul and Jessica into the desert, Paul becomes increasingly concerned for Jessica's safety when the men talk about raping her. Paul tries to use the [[Voice]], but fails on numerous occasions. Eventually, he is successful and commands the soldier to remove his mothers gag. Jessica is able to use the Voice to command the men to kill one another and they are successfully able to escape the ornithopter. They take with them a survival kit left by Yueh. 

With Arrakis under siege, Jessica and Paul are forced to sleep in a tent in the desert. Sadness overwhelms the two, however, when they find Leto's ring — bearing the Atreides seal — and realise that he is more than likely dead. Paul begins to pull away from Jessica, blaming her and the [[Bene Gesserit]] for their intervention.

===Finding the Fremen===
The following morning, Paul and Jessica venture into the desert where they meet with [[Duncan Idaho/2021 film|Duncan Idaho]], who confirms the death of the late Leto. Paul is welcomed by Duncan as the new Duke of House Atreides, and leads the two to a Fremen stronghold where they meet with Dr. Kynes. 

At the stronghold — and old research facility — Kynes explains the history of Arrakis to Paul and Jessica, including how its purpose changed after the discovery of spice. Their time at the facility is cut short, however, when they are attacked by [[Sardaukar]] troops and Idaho is killed. Kynes is able to aid Paul and Jessica to safety and allows them to take her ornithopter before telling them she will meet them with the Fremen. 

Paul pilots the ornithopter and is successfully able to evade the Sardaukar troops, but crashes in the desert not long after. Paul and Jessica begin to panic, however, when the crash attracts a sandworm. Paul is barely able to escape as he comes face-to-face with the sandworm, but finds that it is distracted moments later when someone activates a thumper nearby. 

Shortly after, Paul and Jessica are met by a group of Fremen led by Stilgar. Within the group is [[Chani Kynes/2021 film|Chani]], the Fremen girl Paul has been dreaming about. Stilgar allows the two to stay with their group, but Paul is forced to fight when Jamis contests the their membership. Paul is able to defend himself with ease and kills Jamis moments later. He and Jessica are invited to join the Fremen, which the two accept.

== Physical appearance ==
Paul is a young man with black hair and fair skin. He has a slim athletic build.

== Personality ==
Paul is very serious and both inward and outward thinking. He tends to notice the subtle changes in a person's behavior.

== Differences from the original character ==
Paul is adapted from the [[Paul Atreides|character of the same name]] from the original [[Dune (novel)|''Dune'' novel]].

'''Duncan Idaho''' is a character in the 2021 film ''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]''. He is a [[swordmaster]] in service of [[Leto Atreides I/2021 film|Duke Leto]] of [[House Atreides]], and he trains the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides/2021 film|Paul]]. Duncan Idaho is portrayed by [[Jason Momoa]].

== Character description ==
''A legendary Swordmaster and virtuoso warrior, Duncan Idaho may be House Atreides’ deadliest weapon. A fearless pilot and expert in stealth reconnaissance, he is the eyes and ears of Duke Leto, and the first of House Atreides to leave footprints on the desert sands of Dune. A man of loyalty and lethality, his guiding principle is to fight for the royal family as though they were his own, and to defend Paul Atreides with his life.''<ref>https://www.dunemovie.com/</ref>

== History ==
===Serving Atreides===
Idaho served under Leto during his reign on Caladan and further on his reign on [[Arrakis]]. Duncan is one of the only survivors during the attack on [[Arrakeen]] by the Harkonnens, particularly due to his fighting ability, but because of his reputation as a master swordsman, soldiers seemed fearful of him and let him steal an ornithopter and fly to safety.

Idaho teams up with Liet-Kynes following this and welcomes Jessica and Paul to the research facility. He seems saddened to hear of the death of Leto but welcomes Paul as the new [[Duke]] of House Atreides and therefore, head of the house. Duncan plans to escape Arrakis and get both Jessica and Paul back to safety on Caladan, but find he is unable to resist fighting with a hoard of [[Sardaukar]] troops when they attack the facility. Despite his bravery, Idaho falls at the hands of the troops.
== Physical appearance ==

== Personality ==

== Differences from the original character ==
Duncan Idaho is adapted from the [[Duncan Idaho|character of the same name]] from the original [[Dune (novel)|''Dune'' novel]].

Duncan is fairly similar to his book counterpart, although the latter's personality is largelly only hinted at in the original novel. Both versions of the character feel very duty-bound to the Atreides, considering them not only higher-ups, but a surrogate family of sorts. The main difference lies in Duncan's expressiveness. In the novel, Duncan tries to portray himself as more stoic and reserved, even though he has the occassional ''faux pas'' when he drops his guard and is less overly self-conscious (e.g. the one time he becomes drunk with spice ale). In the film, Duncan has a much more open and easy-going personality, and often shows dry humour or enthusiasm. At the same time, he often tries to stay calm and concentrated while under pressure, similarly to his novel counterpart. As in the novel, Duncan is also portrayed as younger than Gurney. 

In the film, Paul has a similar deep-seated admiration for Duncan as in the novel. Due to Paul's lonely aristocratic upbringing and having virtually no friends of his age, Paul looks up to Duncan as something of an unofficial older brother. This angle is even emphasized in the film compared to the novel. Early in the film, Paul admits to Idaho he dreamt a vision of him falling in battle on Arrakis. Idaho's death eventually comes to pass while he's slowing down the sardaukar to aid Paul's, Jessica's and Dr. Kynes' escape. His death leaves Paul devastated, even though he has little time to mourn another dead or lost member of the family.

Both the book and film Duncan serve in an advance team sent to Arrakis to contact the Fremen and offer them an alliance with the Atreides, and both of them equally express admiration for the Fremen, their resourcefulness and fighting skills. 

Compared to previous screen adaptations, where Duncan's famous swordfighting prowess was little depicted, it is highly emphasized in Villeneuve's adaptation. Though Idaho's training by the Swordmasters of Ginaz is not brought up explicitly, he is repeatedly shown going toe-to-toe with several of the emperor's highly-trained sardaukar. As Duncan states,  "When you cross swords with a Sardaukar, you know it.". Similarly to the Duncan of the novel, he's also depicted as a skilled pilot of ornithopters, and even other types of aircraft.

The casting of Jason Momoa, who is of Pacific Islander ancestry, is the first time a live-action depiction of Idaho portrayed the character as one of a non-European/non-Euro-American phenotype. This is true to the source material, as in the novels, Duncan's somewhat darker skintone is noted a few times. In one of the later novels, Frank Herbert also mentions the epicanthic folds of Idaho's eyes (implying some East Asian elements in his appearance), emphasizing his complex ancestry. Based on Herbert's descriptions, John Schoenherr's illustrations for a 1970s edition of ''Dune'' depicted Duncan with a darker skintone, more akin to that of a Native American or Polynesian. <ref>[http://ski-ffy.blogspot.com/2010/08/illustrated-dune.html Frank Herbert, John Schoenherr, ''The Illustrated Dune'' - Retrospective article on the 1978 illustrated edition of the first novel at Ski-Ffy.blogspot.com]</ref>

A '''[[Trial by Forfeiture]]''' for [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto Atreides I]], which was also known as '''Leto's Gambit''', was held on [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]] in [[10156 AG]], in Leto's first year as the [[Duke]] of [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] following the death of his father [[Paulus Atreides]] in his final [[Paulus Atreides' 10156 bullfight|bullfight]]. It was a demonstration of Leto's great courage as a ruler and thus showed the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] what kind of Duke he would be, but went down in history in the following decades as an important event in the history of both Leto's life and [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. It was moreover also remembered thousands of years later as an important part of the history of the [[Emperor's Blade]].

== History ==

=== Background information ===
Months before the trial, the newly ascended Leto was already becoming known for his steady hand, and for always speaking his mind when it came to the truth. Despite being in office for only a short time, Leto insisted on testifying on behalf of [[House Vernius]] in front of the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]]. His staunch defense of the deposed [[House]], caught the attention of many noblemen, who were intrigued by the young man's honesty.

On the return trip home to Caladan from [[Kaitain]], Leto was caught in a [[Harkonnen]] ambush. They used their a new secret technological device, a [[No-ship|no-ship,]] to destroy a Tleilaxu vessel inside the [[Guild]] [[Heighliner]], making it appear that the Atreides vessel had done the deed.

Immediately, most of the spacecraft that witnessed the horrifying event assumed the offending shots had come from House Atreides, since the invisible Harkonnen craft had fired from just under the Atreides space-faring vessel. Within minutes Leto had to turn on his ship's shields, to avoid being fired upon immediately from the other Great [[House/XD|Houses]]' [[starship]]s. Soon afterwards, the guiding [[Guild Navigator/XD|Navigator]] of the heighliner demanded to know why the shield was on, as it was interfering with the Guild-crafts' [[Holtzman engine]]. Leto explained the situation, and demanded a full Trial by Forfeiture.

=== Prelude ===
Unbeknownst to Leto, the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] needed his bloodline to achieve their future [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], and thus it was essential that he won the trial. While in an enclosed holding cell, he received a message cube from the Sisterhood, which contained the information: "Crown Prince Shaddam, like his father before him, maintains a secret and illegal alliance with the Bene Tleilax. This information may prove valuable to your defense— if you dare use it". 

In a desperate bluff, he delivered his own message cube to his distaff cousin [[Crown Prince]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino]]. a note in which Leto pretended to have full knowledge of House Corrino's [[Project Amal]], claiming that "Sire, defense documentation includes a full disclosure of your relationship with the Tleilaxu". Shaddam's growing fear of the Leto "spilling the beans" made him approach the [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Hidar Fen Ajidica]] and demand for him to call off the Trial, but he could only get him to promise not to harm Leto.

Even this, however, was not fulfilled, as the Tleilaxu sent two assassins to kill Leto in his protected cell. Leto killed one of the attempted assassins with the knife of the Atreides [[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]], and killed the other using the [[holo-cart]]. On the better side of things, this attempt would certainly not look good for the Tleilaxu in the trial. When Leto, Hawat and [[Rhombur Vernius]] were alone again, the Mentat slipped a smuggled [[maula pistol]] into a bottom drawer of the desk, just in case next time a dagger was not sufficient.

Learning of this assassination attempt, [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]], the closest companion of the Crown Prince, killed the surviving pilot of the ship which had brought the assassins. This meant one less witness in the trial and thus slightly less of a case for the Tleilaxu, who quitely removed the pilot from their list of witnesses.

=== The trial ===
A few weeks later, the Landsraad Trial convened, headed up by [[Lord]] [[Bain O'Garee]] of the planet [[Hagal/XD|Hagal]]. Also on the tribunal were [[Baron]] [[Terkillian Sor]] of [[IV Anbus]], [[Duke]] [[Prad Vidal]] of [[Ecaz]], an ally of the Harkonnens, [[Count]] [[Anton Miche]], and [[Rincon]] of [[House Fazeel]]. Leto was represented by two brilliant [[Ellaca]]n attorneys, [[Clere Ruitt]] and [[Bruda Viol]], who had been offered by the exiled [[Ix/XD|Ixian]] Ambassador [[Cammar Pilru]]. As the Trial progressed, Leto was unable to prove that his ship had not fired the shots upon the Tleilaxu vessel. 

As Leto faced the entire congress of nobility, watching with fear as the Lansraad led by O'Garee was just about to pronounce judgment against him, the Emperor strode into the Landsraad Chamber, and spoke a hearty defense of not only Leto, but of the thousands of years lineage of House Atreides. He talked of how both of the Tleilaxu starships could have been destroyed by debris. 

At the end of the speech, Shaddam gave Leto a token of affection, the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino]] heirloom, his personal [[knife]], what would come to be known as the [[Emperor's Blade]], as a gift, and demanded that the Landsraad confirm Leto's innocence, which they did, much to the dismay of the Tleilaxu and Harkonnen. O'Garee and the rest of the tribunal wished to be on the future Emperor's "good side", and promptly released Leto, and proclaimed him innocent.

=== Aftermath ===
Leto returned to Caladan exonerated and innocent. The entire [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] was stunned that Leto had managed to win this seemingly hopeless Trial by Forfeiture. This monumental act granted him respect throughout the Imperium, and Leto’s gambit had impressed many of the Houses, in sharp contrast to earlier matters, in which the Great Houses considered this young Duke to be a bad ruler who did not understand the ways of the empire. 

The young Duke even received a congratulatory letter from [[Hundro Moritani]], the puckish and unlikeable [[Viscount]] of [[Grumman/XD|Grumman]], who often refused to cooperate, or even participate, in matters of the Imperium. The Viscount said he admired Leto’s “brash flouting of the rules,” proving that “leadership is made by strong men with strong convictions, not clerks who study commas on lawslates.” Leto was never entirely sure that Moritani believed in his innocence; instead, he thought the Viscount simply enjoyed seeing the Duke get away unpunished, against such insurmountable odds.

Shortly after his return, with the new experimental form of communication used by the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]], [[GuildLink]], Leto communicated with Shaddam about the status of the planet Ix (which Shaddam refused to call the world, naming it Xuttah). While the now-Emperor agreed to give the Vernius children, Rhombur and Kaliea, pardon, he declined this for the renegade Earl [[Dominic Vernius]] and, also refused to restore the [[House Vernius]] to the planet.

Meanwhile, the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] began to search for who had really fired on the Tleilaxu ships, a search which would in the following decades lead them to [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] and to [[Richese/XD|Richese]], and would result in them destroying the last [[No-ship/XD|no-ship]] for thousands of years.

'''House Atreides''' was one of the [[Houses Major]] within the infrastructure of the [[Galactic Padishah Empire]]. They were ruled by the patriarch of the Atreides family, who took the title of ''Duke''.

== Origins ==
The legend stated that the Atreides family came from a noble family that originated in Greece on [[Earth]], and that they rose to prominence during the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. House Atreides specifically claimed descent from [[King Agamemnon]], a son of Atreus, in Greek mythology. The descendants of Atreus are called "Atreides" (plural "Atreidai", Latinized as "Atreidae") in the Greek language. This Royal House included many significant figures in Greek myth.

== Geographic center ==
Up until the latter days of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]], House Atreides maintained the planetary fief of [[Caladan]] and had their center of operation on the planet, which they had also ruled for twenty generations. House Atreides had perfected a form of government that resulted in a well-organized society and a spiritually satisfied people. Furthermore, House Atreides kept Caladan a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to [[House Harkonnen]]'s capital, [[Giedi Prime]]. However, the House was also proficient in war; it maintained [[Swordmaster]]s, [[Warmaster]]s and [[Mentat]]s to train and lead their army, and had even developed its own [[Battle Language]].

At the request of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], Leto I moved the House to planet [[Arrakis]], to take over mining operations of the [[Spice Melange]] from [[House Harkonnen]]. However, Leto I was walking into a trap set up by a newly formed alliance between [[House Harkonnen]] and [[House Corrino]].

[[Arrakis]] remained the home of House Atreides until its official end.

==Descendants==
[[Leto Atreides II]]'s lack of a direct heir, coupled with his decision to dissolve the [[Atreides Empire]] after his 3,500 year-long life came to an end, saw House Atreides cease to exist as a tangible political power. However, the Atreides bloodline continued through Leto II's twin sister (and legal wife) [[Ghanima Atreides]] and her concubine [[Farad'n Corrino]].

One such group of descendants of Ghanima were Leto II's, majordomo, [[Moneo Atreides]], and his daughter [[Siona Atreides]]. After the bonding of Siona and a ghola of [[Duncan Idaho]], the Atriedes families continued onward. Because of the [[Prescience]] invisibility conferred to the genetic line through Siona, the line flourished for over 1500 years till the time of the [[Return of the Honored Matres]].

According to Leto II's plan, it was impossible to definitively know all of Siona's descendants, as they were immune to prescient vision. Many escaped into obscurity, and more escaped into the Scattering. The Bene Gesserit also maintained multiple Atreides bloodlines within their breeding program, resulting in dozens if not hundreds of descendants (of varying concentration).  

By the time of the return from the Scattering, some five thousand years after the time of Paul-Maud'ib, [[Supreme Bashar]] Miles Teg was a descendant of the Atreides, as was his daughter, the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]], [O dray' dee], who even bore a time-worn version of the last name. Teg and his daughter were closely watched by Bene Gesserit, for any sign of the "wildness" of the Atreides line. This wildness included any sign of them arising to be another super-being, a [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. Reverend Mother [[Lucilla]], a key ally of Darwi, was also a descendant of Siona Atreides through a different branch maintained by the Bene Gesserit. Unexpectedly, the worm-rider [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] was also revealed to be a descendant of Siona: despite being born into obscure poverty on Rakis, her ability to command the worms (foretold by the God Emperor) led to her to becoming a rising, messianic figure within the sisterhood as well.

Teg was killed at the destruction of Rakis when the [[Honored Matres]] attacked and reduced Dune to a charred ball, and Odrade was killed some time later at Junction when the Bene Gesserit attempted to liberate [[Junction]] from the Matres. Lucilla was killed in the fall of Lampadas. Sheanna, however, escaped with a ghola-clone of Miles Teg on a no-ship with the new Duncan Idaho ghola, leaving for parts unknown.

==Living on as Gholas==
Soon after Miles Teg was killed on Rakis, the Bene Gesserit had a ghola of Teg created to oversee the liberation of Junction. When [[Murbella]] took over the reigns of the combined Honored Matres and Gesserit group, the [[New Sisterhood]]; she set Teg free, and enabled him to escape on the [[no-ship]], with [[Sheeana]] and another ghola of [[Duncan Idaho]].

Paulus Atreides' 10156 bullfight
{{Quote|Yes, the difficult fights are the best, and the people of [[Caladan/XD | Caladan]] will remember this one for a long, long time.|Paulus' prophetic internal thoughts not long before his death|Dune: House Atreides}}{{Event infobox|name=Paulus Atreides' 10156 bullfight|location=[[Plaza de Toros]], [[Caladan/XD | Caladan]], [[Delta Pavonis]]|date=[[10156 AG]]|participants=*[[Paulus Atreides]]
*[[Salusan bull]]|description=Fatal fight between [[Paulus Atreides]] and a [[Salusan bull]]|image=Paulus atreides and a salusan bull.jpg}}

The final bullfight of [[Duke]] [[Paulus Atreides]], which resulted in his planned death and was also the last to take place on [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]] overall, took place in the [[Plaza de Toros]] in [[10156 AG]], around the same time that [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] [[Elrood Corrino IX/XD|Elrood Corrino IX]] died on [[Kaitain]].

== History ==
At first, Duke Paulus played with the Salusan bull for a while, dancing beyond the reach of its horns, completing his expected performance for the excited Caladanian spectators. Seeing that the bull did not tire after the better part of an hour, though, and that it remained focused on killing him, he grew concerned enough that he made up his mind to end the contest as quickly as possible. He planned to use his shield, a trick he had learned from one of the finest matadors in the Imperium.

The next time the bull shot past him, its horns ricocheted off the Duke's personal shield, a collision that finally disorientated it. The Duke stabbed the bull's head with his ''banderilla'' and set the barbed hook into its muscles. Unbeknownst to Paulus, however, the barbed tip was not actually drugged, due to the treachery of his own wife, [[Helena Atreides]], in working with the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]] to kill him.

Because of this, the bull floundered to its feet once more and sped towards him to Paulus' suprirse. The Duke again side-stepped, but the bull managed to get the ''mutela'' on its multiple horns, tearing his ceremonial cloth to shreds. At this point he realised that this was going to be a greater challenge than he had expected. Holding up his second ''banderilla'', the Duke used it like a fencing sword. Without a cape to distract the bull, he now had only one short, barbed spear as his weapon, and a partial shield for protection.

The bull charged directly towards Paulus and picked up speed, at which he began to suspect of the sabotage that had taken place. As the bull and the Duke closed to within meters of each other, the bull feinted to the right. Paulus jabbed with his short spear, but the beast instantly swerved and attacked from a different direction. This time the barb caught on a knob of the bull's skin, but did not sink in. It tore out of the Duke's grasp and dropped to the floor as the bull dashed past.

For a moment at this point Paulus was weaponless, but scrambled backwards and snatched for the ''banderilla'' on the ground. Turning his back on the bull, he listened for it to grind to a stop and come back, but as he bent over to retrieve his weapon, it reached him with incredible speed, entering his safety zone, ducking under the partial shield and ramming home. Its horns gouged deep into the Duke's back, breaking through his ribs into his lungs and heart to the horror of the crowd, before thrashing him from side to side.

Within seconds of Paulus' death, the [[Mentat/XD|Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]] and the Atreides guards entered the field and cut the Salusan bill into piles o meat with their lasguns. The creature's momentum caused the carcass to fly apart in different directions. Its head was later placed on a wall in Castle Caladan facing a painting of the Old Duke Paulus.

Unnamed Atreides Gladiator
An unnamed [[Atreides]] [[soldier]] who had been taken captive on [[Arrakis]] by [[House Harkonnen]] faced [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] as a [[slave]]-[[Gladiator]] at the Arena of [[Barony]] on [[Giedi Prime]].He was a fanatic who had sworn to avenge the death of his house and had carved the Atreides hawk into his flesh.He seemed to have been un-drugged by [[Thufir Hawat]] as part of one of his schemes against his new masters.Feyd however escaped his subsequent death when he cheated by using a code word to paralyze the soldier and by having [[poison]] on his black [[blade]], rather than the white one.

==Dune 2021==

It has been teased that this unnamed character will be the same character who was played by Roger Yuan in the 2021 adaption and who will eventually return in [[Dune: Part Two]] and his name will be "Lieutenand Lanville", although he remained unnamed on screen so far.

'''Bellonda''' was a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[mentat]] [[Reverend Mother]] at the time of the attack on [[Arrakis|Rakis]] by the [[Honored Matres]] and was amongst [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]]'s advisors. Bellonda was also in charge of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Archives on the [[Chapterhouse]] planet.

An overweight woman who could have easily adjusted her metabolism to control her girth, Bellonda, or ''Bell'', as she was referred to by Odrade, chose to maintain a plump figure (as well as use spectacles) so that she could make a statement of sorts. Bellonda was an acerbic and bitter woman, who always spoke her mind to the Mother Superior. Despite often expressing very strong and different opinions that could have had her banished, Odrade kept Bellonda as close counsel as a form of conscience.

Bellonda is also revealed as a descendant of Reverend Mother [[Tertius Eileen Anteac]].

'''Chakobsa''', also known as the ''magnetic language'', was a hybrid language derived from various ancient [[Bhotani]] dialects, especially the Bhotani hunting language.

The language probably came into being after the first few [[War of Assassins|Wars of Assassins]]. It became used to a lesser or greater extent by several groups, including the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Fremen]].

When [[House Corrino]] ruled the known universe, [[House Atreides]] used a form of Chakobsa as their [[Battle Language]].
==Vocabulary==

*[[Bi-lal kaifa]]
*[[Bindu]]
*[[Ghafla]] "distraction"

*[[Kwisatz Haderach]]
*[[Muad'Dib]]
*[[Prana]]
*[[Sayyadina]] "friend of God"
*[[Shadout]]
*[[Umma]]

==Meaning==
{{encyclopedia}}
The word ''chakobsa'' is found in the partially reconstructed language [[Bhotani]] and means "jargon" or "shop-talk".

==Behind the Scenes==
Chakobsa was a real-life secret language used by the medieval Circassian knights and princes. The name is derived from Bzhedukh (another Caucasian language) words ''šhə-k'oa-bza'', meaning 'the language of hunters' [http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003126.php]. Since the fictional Chakobsa is said to be a hunting language, it is probable that Frank Herbert, who was interested in Muslim cultures, knew about this fact.

The Chakobsa and Fremen language of the Duniverse appears to be a portmanteau of French, Romani, Hebrew, Slavic, Greek and heavily altered Persian, Turkish, Sanskrit and Arabic.

Slig
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Slig.png|thumb|Slig by RingmasterBent on DeviantArt]]

A '''Slig''' was a genetically engineered hybrid created by the [[Bene Tleilax]]. The creature was a cross between a giant slug and a pig.

The animal was considered ugly, even disgusting, with multiple mouths and skin that excreted a slimy and noxious residue. However, it was bred domestically for its meat, which was sweet, tender, and highly sought after by many across the [[Known Universe]] - many called it "the sweetest meat this side of heaven." Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] was particularly fond of eating slig. [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]], on the other hand, thought they were disgusting.

Probably for religious reasons, the Tleilaxu did not eat the slig. However, they had no qualms with allowing [[powindah]] to pollute themselves with the unclean meat of the slig.

Fish Speaker
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Fish_Speaker.jpg|thumb|Artist rendition of a Fish Speaker, looking over the cosmos, from the Russian cover of ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'']]

The '''Fish Speakers''' were an army created during the rule of [[God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]]. The '''Fish Speaker''' army was entirely composed of women, with men having no roles in the Fish Speakers' lives other than that of husband. Men were totally shut out of the Fish Speaker combat forces, with the exception of the [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]]s. They were trained to be fanatical, disciplined, and extremely effective soldiers and police. The Fish Speakers were also used in Leto's breeding program, taking advantage of their speed and strength.

==Early History==

Leto II founded the Fish Speakers to enforce his rule over the [[known universe]]. He found the existing [[Fremen]] and [[Sardaukar]] forces unsuitable to his needs. Leto believed that male dominated military forces were essentially predatory and would turn against the civilian population in the absence of an external enemy, whereas a female one would tame and calm. He also needed a reliable religious organization to enforce what came to be known as [[Leto's Peace]] to ensure the unfolding of the [[Golden Path]].

With the exception of the nomadic Amazons who legend described as once ruling part of the Asian steppes of the Old Earth, the Fish Speakers were just about the only effective all-female army known throughout the history of the Dune universe. They were also, in terms of worlds ruled and historical longevity, the most effective military force ever known, though males were still employed as house guards.

==Troop Types and Equipment==

The Fish Speakers were not only an army but also served as Leto's bureaucracy: pages, courtiers, archivists and teachers; some were priestesses, serving as judge, jury, executioner in one. Leto also used them as secret agents and assassins, apart from the official Fish Speaker Guard and elite units as the Imperial Guard. Errant Fish Speakers were isolated and served as Death Commandos or Berserkers. Men originally only served as advisory capacity and only later became Fish speaker auxiliaries, which was generally seen as a sign of the degeneration of the original Fish Speaker schools. The Fish Speaker Guard used not only [[stun club]]s, [[Elacca]] whips, long [[knives]], [[silver-blade]]s, and [[stun grenade]]s but also heavy [[weapons]], while [[Lasguns]] were only fielded by specially trained forces. In addition to infantry, the Fish Speakers also used [[Aircraft|aircraft]], generally large [[ornithopter]]s, but also smaller guardships. To support infantry, the Fish Speakers relied on [[Suspensor|suspensor]]-sleds, armored [[Groundcar]]s were uncommon in Leto's reign, but common in later times.

The Fish Speakers typically wore skintight one-piece uniforms or uniform-robes with the hawk symbol on the left breast, cloaks or cape-robes, high boots and, for commanders, heavy black armor and face masks. The common color was a rich dark blue, although acolytes and trainees wore short green robes, imperial Guards wore [[Atreides]] Green, and Fish Speaker Commanders sported black uniforms with gold piping. Fish Speakers who left the Fish Speaker Guard wore ceremonial white. Agents or spies who wanted to hide their identity sometimes used [[Cibus Mask|Cibus masks]].

==Post–God-Emperor Rule==
After Leto II's death, control of the Fish Speakers passed to the ghola of [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho]] and [[Siona Atreides]]. Their influence had significantly waned in comparison to the [[Bene Tleilax]], [[Ixian]]s and the [[Bene Gesserit]]. A Fish Speaker council controlled some areas of space that used to fall under Leto's rule. By this time, however, the Fish Speakers had also incorporated men into their ranks, and held little in common with the force maintained by Leto II in terms of philosophy or practices.

Also by this time, many of the leaders of the Fish Speakers had been replaced with Tleilaxu [[Face Dancers]], essentially making the Fish Speakers, and the realms under their domain, puppets of the Tleilaxu.
==Trivia==
*Leto II named his army "Fish Speakers" because the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams.
*Some believe that the Fish Speakers may have been the inspiration for the Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle) from the ''Warhammer 40,000 ''gaming franchise.

Galach
{{mixed}}

'''Galach''' was the official language of the [[Imperium]], and by far the most widely spoken language in the [[known universe]].

It originated primarily from English and various Slavic tongues, along with numerous other ancient [[Earth]] languages. As with any language, over the millennia it evolved and adopted various cultural markers.

Galach was spoken in one form or other by the majority of conventional humans, as well as by some genetically altered humans, such as the [[futar]]s and the [[Bene Tleilax]]. Written Galach was generally understood from one planet to another, despite regional dialects.

Several groups spoke Galach in addition to specialized languages (e.g. the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] [[Battle Language]]) and arcane variants (e.g. the native [[Fremen]] language). Other groups spoke Galach in addition to ancient [[Earth]] languages or older largely obsolete languages like [[Chakobsa]]. An example of this was the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood: [[Reverend Mother]]s periodically spoke old French.
==Examples==
*Atreidean Galach: ''baradit nehiidit beed gwarp tau nubukt''
(A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush)

* bashar

(Colonel Bashar, literally Colonel-General -- Derived from the Russian and Cold War Eastern Bloc military rank, but here expressed from the Turkish, ''pasha -- ''nobleman, general.)

==Appearances==
Virtually all Dune works feature Galach, however the novels where it is mentioned by name are:
*''[[Hunting Harkonnens]]''
*''[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]''
*''[[Dune: House Atreides]]''

Litany Against Fear
{{Mixed}}

[[File:51wVoLA4wqL-1.jpg|thumb]]

The '''Litany Against Fear''' was a litany spoken by many highly educated people who faced danger or fear during their everyday lives. The litany helped focus their minds in times of peril.

== Origin ==
The phrase derives from William Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', “A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once. It seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.”

An ancient form of the litany existed already during the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. A mantra of the [[City of Introspection]] went like this:

:''"I have no fear, for fear is the little death that kills me over and over. Without fear, I die but once."''

The version of the litany used in the time of Paul Muad'dib was believed to have originated with the [[Bene Gesserit]], who themselves faced great dangers during their extensive training.[[File:Fear is the mindkiller.jpg|thumb]]

== Content of the Litany ==
The Litany is as follows:

: "I must not fear.
: Fear is the mind-killer.
: Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
: I will face my fear.
: I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
: And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
: Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

: ''<span id="cke_bm_73E" style="display:none;"> </span>''

<span style="display:none;"> </span>

== Examples of Usage ==
[[Paul Atreides]], the son of [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]], used the Litany when the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] compelled him to put his right hand in a device that causes pain as a test of his presence of mind. The litany helped him to withstand the excruciating agony.
<nowiki> </nowiki>It was a test of his humanity in a qualitative sense. A person whose nature is still primarily bestial recoils from pain and seeks to flee it to preserve itself, a person of higher nature goes through it and out the other side in order to remove the threat permanently. 

"You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind."

== Behind the Scenes ==
A somewhat different version of this litany was used in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|''Dune'' miniseries]] and [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|''Children of Dune'' miniseries]]:

: "I will not fear.
: Fear is the mind-killer.
: I will face my fear.
: I will let it pass through me.
: When the fear has gone,
: there shall be nothing.
: Only I will remain."

The litany has also appeared in other non-''Dune'' related media. For instance, it was frequently recited by Peter Puppy, a supporting character in ''Earthworm Jim'', the animated series based on the video game of the same name.

The '''inkvine''' was a creeping plant native to [[Giedi Prime]] and frequently used as a whip in the slave pens of [[House Harkonnen]]. Victims were marked by beet-colored tattoos that cause residual pain for many years. [[Gurney Halleck]] bore an inkvine scar on his cheek as a consequence of his attack on [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]] while a slave on Giedi Prime.

*[[ Jessica Atreides]] (mother-in-law)
*[[ Leto Atreides]] (father-in-law)|height=Tall|romances=*[[ Paul Atreides ]] (husband)|image=Irulan 1984.jpg}}

'''Princess''' '''Irulan Corrino''' [b. [[10176 AG]]] was the eldest daughter of the 81st Padishah Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], and [[Anirul Corrino|Anirul]], a [[Bene Gesserit]] of [[Hidden Rank]]. She was also the wife, in title only, of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]], and an important historian who chronicled the events of Paul's rise to the Imperial throne through a series of written works.

==Etymology==
Irulan's name is an anagram of her mother [[Anirul]]'s name. The first two letters of the mother's name are moved to the end of the daughter's. This may be significant since she was the firstborn and first of Shaddam's daughters to be trained as a Bene Gesserit.

==History==
===Upbringing===
As the eldest of five daughters to Shaddam, Irulan was raised under auspicious circumstances in the Imperial Court, and received an excellent education through the Bene Gesserit. Like her younger sisters [[Chalice Corrino|Chalice]], [[Wensicia Corrino|Wensicia]], [[Josifa Corrino|Josifa]], and [[Rugi Corrino|Rugi]], Irulan was conditioned to be a lady of refinement and elegance.

From an early age, Irulan's father Shaddam IV expected her to become Empress after his death, or at the very least to wed a political ally and retain House Corrino's hegemony over the Imperium. The Bene Gesserit also saw potential in the girl, and gave her sufficient training so that they could exploit her at some point in the future, were she to find herself in a position of power.

However, despite the expectations of others, Irulan remained only an average Bene Gesserit adept, and retained a strong sense of personal identity and ambition: qualities that caused tension between herself and her equally strong-minded father. Lady Jessica mused that Irulan was too proud to progress very far with her Bene Gesserit training, and that the Sisterhood never pressed the point because Irulan's primary use would be as Shaddam's daughter, even with Bene Gesserit abilities.

===The Plot against House Atreides===
Irulan was gradually drawn into the events on [[Arrakis]] as her father orchestrated his plot to destroy Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] and [[House Atreides]], with the aid of [[House Harkonnen]]. As Leto's power and influence grew in the [[Landsraad]], there was wide speculation that Irulan could be married to his son, Paul to symbolize Shaddam's selection of House Atreides to peacefully assume the Imperial throne after his death; but the Emperor's jealousy of the "Red Duke" Leto instead led him to orchestrate a plot to destroy him.

Irulan wrote everything important in her private diary:
:''"My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance between them — my father and this man in the portrait--both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. 'Princess-daughter, my father said, I would that you'd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.' My father was 71 years old at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was only 14 years old, but yet I remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.”'' — In My Father's House by the Princess Irulan

To get [[House Harkonnen]] to assist with this scheme, the Emperor offered to potentially give Irulan in marriage to the Harkonnen heir apparent, the na-Baron [[Feyd-Rautha Rabban Harkonnen]], along with the riches of the Arrakis [[fief]]. Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] favored this arrangement, as he believed such a union and plan would greatly assist in the establishment of a Harkonnen Empire. Irulan was so ensnared, and would oppose being used as such a pawn.

The plot against the Atreides was executed: lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there, the Atreides were soon attacked by Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial [[Sardaukar]]). Leto was killed, but Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica fled into the desert and were presumed dead. A crisis on Arrakis began when the mysterious Muad'Dib emerged as an effective leader of the native Fremen tribes against the rule of the Harkonnens. He was, of course, a very-much-alive Paul Atreides.

===Downfall of the Corrinos===
[[File:220px-Irulan-RoadtoDune.jpg|thumb|Irulan Corrino -Illustration from  the Road to Dune]]
When the mysterious [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] emerged as an effective leader of the [[Fremen]] after House Atreides was deposed from Arrakeen rule, Irulan became entangled further with the [[Bene Gesserit]], who sought to use her as a spy against her father. Later, when Paul Atreides succeeded in conquering the Imperial strongholds on Arrakis, Irulan was with her father in [[Arrakeen]]. She subsequently witnessed Paul's defeat of the Harkonnen na-Baron in an [[kanly]] act that effectively destroyed House Harkonnen. Then, Irulan was made to marry the Fremen leader - much to the concern of Paul's consort, [[Chani]] - in order for Paul to legitimise his rule and take away the [[Golden Lion Throne]] from Shaddam IV. Being unaware of Paul's devotion to Chani, Irulan agreed to the union, believing she would be the one to produce the Imperial heir apparent, and thus retain House Corrino's power over the Known Universe.
{{Clear}}
===An Unhappy Marriage===
Following the consolidation of Paul's rule over the Imperium, Irulan quickly discovered that she was Paul's wife in title only, and that his beloved Fremen consort, Chani, was his exclusive partner and the sole bearer of his children. Jealousy and resentment drove her to secretly drug Chani with dangerous contraceptives, so that she would not produce his heirs. However, the scheme did not work as intended, and Irulan was left with remorse when Chani died after giving birth to twins named [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]]. This act, combined with the apparent death of Paul Atreides after he walked into the desert a blind man, led her to devote herself to House Atreides and her two surviving stepchildren. [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who had never liked Irulan, grudgingly admitted that she "reek[ed] of trustworthiness," and allowed her to become Leto and Ghanima's guardian, since her defection destroyed any hope the Bene Gesserit had of manipulating the children.

Through their developmental years, and following the rise of the [[God-Emperor]] Leto Atreides II, Irulan spent her remaining years studying and documenting all the events that came to pass since House Atreides took control of Arrakis in 10,191 A.G. She was occasionally flustered by the twins' unusual behavior, given their [[Other Memory]].

==Writings==
Irulan was a prolific author, as evidenced by the fact that many chapters in the novels begin with an [[wikipedia:Epigraph_(literature)|epigraph]] from one of her writings. Below is a partial list:

* "Manual of Muad'Dib"
* "Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries"

== Behind the Scenes ==

In the 1984 movie ''[[Dune (1984 movie)|Dune]]'', the role of the Princess Irulan was played by actress [[wikipedia:Virginia Madsen|Virginia Madsen]], who, in keeping with her appearance in the book, provides an opening narration and only appears in person in the opening and closing scenes. Helena Bonham Carter had been cast in the role, but was forced to leave production for scheduling conflicts with ''A Room With a View'' (1983).

In the 2000 and 2003 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ''[[Dune (2000 miniseries)|Dune]]'' and ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'', the character was played by [[wikipedia:Julie Cox|Julie Cox]]. The character's role was greatly expanded in the first miniseries so that she could serve as a window into House Corrino, and to reduce viewer confusion as to why Paul would marry a total stranger at the end. Irulan also narrated the opening of every episode, while her portrayal in the second miniseries is consistent with her storyline in the novels.

Irulan does not appear in the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film]], and the opening narration is instead provided by Chani Kynes from a Fremen perspective. Irulan is set to appear in [[Dune: Part Two]], played by [[wikipedia:Florence Pugh|Florence Pugh]].

Alejandro Jodorowsky had planned to cast Amanda Lear as Irulan for his failed 1974 Dune adaption.

Known Universe
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Old_Earth.jpg|thumb|400px]]

[[File:Central_Planets.jpg|thumb|400px]]

The term '''the Known Universe''' referred to the area of the portion of the Universe that was explored and documented by humans. The vast majority of this space was claimed to be within the [[Imperium]], the realm of the [[Padishah Emperor]]s (who referred to themselves as "Padishah Emperors of the Known Universe" as a result).

Though the Padishah Emperors laid claim to ruling the Known Universe, in reality, it was considered to be at least slightly greater than the size of the [[Imperium]] itself. During the reign of the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], the [[Bene Tleilax]] sought to establish colonies outside of the God-Emperor's Empire, but still within the Known Universe, for instance. The Tleilaxu believed that Leto's [[prescience]] ended at the borders of the Imperium (they were incorrect, however, as Leto came to demonstrate).

The size of the Known Universe increased sporadically over history, as humanity explored more and more of previously uncharted space. The most significant growth came at two specific historical points:
* when [[space travel|space folding]] was invented, following the [[Butlerian Jihad]], and
* when [[The Scattering]] occurred, following the death of the [[God-Emperor]].
The second instance was facilitated by the invention of [[Ixian]] [[No-ship]]s, which did not require a [[spice melange|melange]]-addicted [[Guild Navigator]] to pilot.

==Behind the Scenes==
The borders of the Known Universe are never accurately described. Even after the merger of the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Honored Matres]], when the Known Universe was larger than it had ever been, the full extent of manned space is undisclosed.

However, some projections can be made, based upon the known locations of stars, and basic Dune history. The human race began on Old Earth, and colonized numerous worlds around other stars. These ranged from nearby stars within 20 light years, to several stars 100-200 light-years away from Earth, and the furthest known colonized star of the Imperium, Beta Lyncis, which was 410 light-years away. However, even Beta Lyncis (and its planet Ishia) is well within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. Also, it seems that the Old Imperium remained centered on the general region of Earth - consider that the Atreides and Harkonnen homeworlds, Caladan and Geidi Prime, were each about 20 light years from Old Earth respectively. Assuming that the Dune series takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy, it can be clearly surmised that the Old Imperium remained situated in the Orion Arm (even though Frank Herbert calls it a "multigalactic empire"). Taking Frank Herbert's words into account, it is possible that the Imperium extended outside of this region of the Milky Way Galaxy, encompassing the entire Milky Way, and extending into the nearby Andromeda Galaxy (such as [[Tupile]], or the [[Ixian]] colony that Leto II discovered through prescient vision), with only the most prominent planets of the pre-Scattering Imperium being in the Orion Arm. The Scattering changed all this, however - the people of the Scattering not only spread throughout the Milky Way Galaxy, but made fold-space jumps to other galaxies, such as Andromeda. In this way, people lived too far and wide to be governed by a single prescient force, as God-Emperor Leto II had intended. This, combined with the prescience-cloaking genes spread by [[Siona Atreides]]' descendants, achieved Leto II's [[Golden Path]].

'''Korba''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] follower of [[Paul Atreides|Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides]], the supposed [[Mahdi]]. Beginning his rise to power as one of the original [[Fedaykin]] who Paul trained in the [[Weirding Way]] during the [[Desert War]], he served as a commander in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]] which allowed Paul to usurp [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and become the [[Padishah Emperor]] and led to the Fremen waging [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a twelve-year galactic jihad]] in his name. 

After the Battle of Arrakeen, Korba was given the title of Panegyrist, becoming an important member of Paul's [[Qizarate]] and rose to the additional title of [[High Priest]] by the year [[10208 AG]]. It was at this point that Korba turned against his Mahdi, becoming embroiled in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|a conspiracy]] to martyr the Emperor, a conspiracy whose leading instigators also included Princess [[Irulan Corrino]], Paul's wife in name only, [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Spacing Guild]] [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], and [[Scytale]], a [[Face Dancer]]. Korba was killed by [[Stilgar]] after his complicity in the conspiracy was discovered.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In the TV miniseries adaption of Children of Dune, Korba was portrayed by Czech actor Karel Dobrý, who also portrayed Liet Kynes in the original Dune miniseries. The motivation of Korba is altered in the miniseries so instead of a desire to martyr him so his religious power would increase drastically, Korba is a rebel hating the Atreides Empire. He is also seen to be a friend of the child Javid.

In the 1984 movie, it is speculated that the character Korba, who speaks the line at min 93.45 "If you be a Reverend Mother, let Shai-hulud judge now!" was played by Dennis Hopper in an uncredited role.

Prescience
{{Or-DE,Ex}}{{Quote|[[Paul Atreides |Muad'Dib]] gave us a particular kind of knowledge about prophetic insight, about the behaviour which surrounds such insight and its influence upon events which are seen to be on line.' (That is, events which are set to occur in a related system which the prophet reveals and interprets.) As has been noted elsewhere, such insight operates as a peculiar trap for the prophet himself. He can become the victim of what he knows - which is a relatively common human failing. The danger is that those who predict real events may overlook the polarizing effect brought about by overindulgence in their own truth. They tend to forget that nothing in a polarized universe can exist without its opposite being present.|The Prescient Vision by [[Farad'n Corrino | Harq al-Ada]]|Children of Dune}}

'''Prescience''' was the term commonly used to describe the ability to see into both the past, present and future. Some [[awareness spectrum narcotics]] allowed their users to become prescient. The [[spice melange]] was one example among many in the [[Imperium]].

== Concept of Prescience ==
In the Dune books there are a number of individuals that are capable of various levels of prescience. These include [[Guild Navigator|Guild Navigators]], who used such abilities to plot a safe path for [[Heighliner|Heighliners]] when traveling through space. The Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] was regarded as having some degree of prescience and used the Dune Tarot to enhance it. [[Alia Atreides]], the sister of [[Muad'Dib]], also had limited prescience.

== The Atreides ==
[[Paul Atreides]] started having prescient dreams in his youth on Caladan. When he was exposed to Melange on [[Arrakis]] in [[10,191]] [[A.G.]] his abilities were enhanced. This became even more pronounced after changing the Water of Life. As a result, Paul could see events transpiring in the distant future. Paul's prescience was so powerful that when he lost his eyesight due to a [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[stone burner]], he could interact with the world around him without aid. This was because he was able to remember all the details of his vision of the future. Essentially, Paul knew where everyone would be and what they would say and do.

However, it was not until his son, Leto II came to adulthood that the full power of Atreides prescience came to fruition. Leto's [[Golden Path]] was a way in which he saw mankind surviving through the eons. He could predict the demise of the human race, so he put himself in a position where he could change its evolution. Leto knew that humanity would go down the path of [[The Scattering]] as a reaction to his enforced peace.

Some 1500 years after his death, Leto's words were found in [[Sietch Tabr]] by a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]]. Leto had predicted that the Bene Gesserit would ally themselves with the Bene Tleilax.

== Limitations ==
===Ability to See One's Own Death===
Despite those with prescient abilities possessing the power to see into the future, it had its limitations. Primarily, those who possessed true prescience could see their own death long before it happened. As a result, prescient individuals were prone to despair, and usually felt a sense of loss for their humanity. 

=== Inability to See Other Prescient Individuals ===
Paul Atreides discussed his inability of prescient individuals from "seeing" each other. Essentially, oracles were "mutually blind." This is why the plot between the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild took place with Edric, a prescient Guild Navigator, present. Additionally, people who shared the aims of other prescient people were hidden from view. The one exception to this was the God-Emperor: he was capable of not only seeing the future, but seeing other prescient individuals. 

===Siona and Her Descendants ===
[[Leto II]] specifically bred generations of people to create an individual who was invisible to prescient viewers. [[Siona Atreides]] was this individual.  Although not prescient she was invisible to prescient sight. This was also true of those descendants that carried her genotypes.

Salusan Bull
{{mixed}}
[[File:Paulus atreides and a salusan bull.jpg|thumb]]
'''Salusan bulls''' are bovine animals native to [[Salusa Secundus]]. Their backs are covered with spines, their heads are black studded with multiple horns, and have faceted eyes. They have two separated brains.

A particularly fierce creature, Salusan bulls were kept in [[Caladan]]. Stablemaster [[Yresk]] tended the bulls for Duke [[Paulus Atreides]] for his occasional spectacles; however a Salusan bull was responsible for the death of Duke [[Paulus Atreides]]. After the Old Duke's death, the bull was slain. 

During the reign of [[Leto Atreides I|Leto the Just]], the bull's head was mounted and hung on the wall of the Atreides dining hall, firstly on [[Caladan]], then on [[Arrakis]].

== Behind the Scenes ==

Conceivably, this creature was one of the dangers that Imperial [[Sardaukar]] experienced when being raised on the harsh environment of Salusa Secundus during their training, and may have contributed to the high mortality rate experienced during their upbringing.

== Apocrypha ==

The Storyboard art for Jodorowsky's 1974 adaption by Moebius depicts the Bull as a rhino-like creature.

Slavery
{{mixed}}

[[File:Slaves.jpg|thumb]]

'''Slavery''' was an ancient practice of human labor that re-emerged and remained in the following millennia, although controversially.

==Slavery by machines==
Slavery existed even after the [[Time of Titans]]. Most slaves were mainly captured humans that served the [[Thinking Machines]] of the [[Synchronized Worlds]]. Humans were called derogatorily ''[[hrethgir]]'' by the machines; they were kept in conditions more becoming of animals, and executed for no reason. Slaves were overseen by [[trustee]] crew bosses, privileged humans.

==Among the [[League Worlds]]==
However not only the Machines enslaved humans, but slavery existed among human worlds as well. [[Poritrin]] was the first member of the [[League of Nobles]] who, after [[Sajak Bludd]]'s rule, became a staunch supporter of slavery. Indeed, Poritrin's powerful agricultural and light industrial sectors were highly dependent on its large number of [[Zensunni]] and [[Zenshiite]] slaves. Bludd's mentality was that during the Time of Titans, several cowards and pacifists (mainly [[Buddislamics]]) denied helping humanity defend itself; therefore slavery could make them repay their debt to it. 

[[Zanbar]] was also a world that endorsed slavery and a prominent slave market.

During that time, [[Tlulaxa]] and Zanbar [[slaver]]s made raids on [[Unallied Planets]], captured natives, and sold them to those League planets, although it remained a controversial subject among politic circles, heavily criticized by activists like [[Serena Butler]].

==Imperium time==

[[File:Dune26.jpg|thumb|Slavepits - supposed early draft for Jodorowsky´s Dune ]]

Millennia later, slavery was still used on many planets of the [[Imperium]] prior to and during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. Slaves were called '''Maulas'''.

Slaves were used throughout the [[Known Universe]]. The [[Na-Baron]], [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]], used slaves to practice his battle skills. He would practice with them in his [[gladiator]] ring, in which they were referred to as ''slave gladiators''. For the purpose of fighting them, he would poison them with the [[Elacca drug]].

Slaves were also used for sexual purposes, by [[House Harkonnen]] as well as other Houses of the [[Imperium]].

Suspensors
{{mixed}}
The '''Holtzman Suspensors''' are hovering devices which utilize the secondary (low-drain) phase of a [[Holtzman Effect|Holtzman field generator]] to nullify gravity within certain limits prescribed by relative mass and energy consumption.

The original conceptor of the suspensors was [[Norma Cenva]], while working for [[Tio Holtzman]] on [[Poritrin]]. She was based on Holtzman's original shield design, but was then heavily modified by herself. The first invention which employed this principle were the [[glowglobe]]s.

Suspensors are used in chairs, tables, and structures that are too massive to be physically sound, among many other obvious uses.

The grotesquely obese Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] utilised suspensor belts and harnesses to buoy his flesh and allow him to walk. Suspensors are also used to generate artificial gravity aboard spaceships.

Scattering
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Diasporawarriors.png|thumb|Warriors returned from the Scattering - Heretics of Dune french edition cover art]]
'''The Scattering''' was a major historical event that occurred in the chaotic period following the death of [[Leto Atreides II]], the [[God-Emperor]]. Leto's death saw the eventual breakdown of his empire, severe famine on many worlds, and the introduction of [[Ixian]] [[no-ship]]s. It was all part of [[The Golden Path]], as put forward by Leto, which was triggered by a perceived need to diversify the human race and allow it to evolve.

==Origin==
Leto II's prescience allowed him to see into both the past and the future, and he believed that ten thousand years of rule by the [[Faufreluches]] had allowed the human race to become stagnant, and that drastic action on Leto's part was needed in order for the human race to survive.

The entire purpose of "Leto's Golden path" was to force the human race to abandon certainty, security, and safety as individual goals and to "scatter" not only geographically, but also to do so technologically, ideologically, and socio-politically.

As a result of this philosophy, during the reign of Leto II humanity was predominantly planet bound and ruled by an iron fist for more than 3500 years. This was in contrast to the relative freedom of expression and movement people enjoyed to a limited degree under the [[Faufreluches]], the limits being predominantly the inherent control of feudal rule and the [[Spacing Guild]] monopoly on space travel. Indeed, Leto II exerted a level of control that was unprecedented in the [[Imperium]], including power over the Guild and space travel, a feat that previous Emperors had been unable to accomplish. Upon Leto's death, the stalwart and long-established order of the Imperium disintegrated, as did control over freedoms and movement, and as a result, humanity rediscovered independence and nobilities on an unprecedented scale. This paved the way for humanity to "scatter" across the universe into the unknown and further evolution of the human race.

According to Leto II's plan, his death was followed by a collapse of political control and Spice supplies - as it would take generations for the Spice cycle to reassert itself on Rakis. Political order collapsed and entire worlds starved to death, in a chaotic period known as the [[Famine Times]]. The Scattering was an immediate response to the Famine Times, as refugees fled the anarchy consuming the Old Imperium.

==Scattering Space==
During The Scattering, many people remained within the boundaries of the [[Old Imperium]]. Many, however, did not. Countless humans departed the Old Imperium for uncharted space, never to return. For 1,500 years, humanity explored the uncharted realms of the universe beyond the boundaries of the Old Imperium. New groups and cultures evolved. 

During the Scattering, vast waves of refugees spread outwards into uncharted space, so that the number of human-colonized worlds exponentially ballooned both in number and spread. The Bene Gesserit who remained in the territories of the Old Imperium could only make vague guesses at the size of "Scattering space", as it was theoretically infinite and even the Honored Matres might not know its full extent. One clue is that the Lost Ones returning from the Scattering refer to the Old Imperium as "the million worlds" or "the million planets" - implying that Scattering space is at least several multiples larger than that.

Little is also known of the exact socio-political history of what happened in Scattering space, other than that its development across 1,500 years was fairly rapid - a direct reaction to the enforced sedentary nature of Leto's Peace for 3,500 years, or the 10,000 year static structure of the Faufreluches under the Corrino empire.

What is known is that eventually, the [[Honored Matres]] developed as a fusion of [[Bene Gesserit]] and [[Fish Speakers]] (and possibly other groups) who had fled into the Scattering. An aggressive group focused on conquest and domination, the Honored Matres carved out vast swaths of territory among the worlds settled in the Scattering. One of these worlds, or perhaps a collection of worlds, was referred to as "[[Dur (planet)|Dur]]".

Another group that rose to prominence in Scattering space were the Lost Tleilaxu - no longer bound by even the pretense of following the restrictions of the [[Great Convention]], they pushed genetic manipulation drastically farther than their [[Bene Tleilax]] forbearers in the Old Imperium ever did. Among other creations, the Lost Tleilaxu brazenly spliced together human and animal stock, creating the feline-based [[Futars]] and fish-based [[Phibians]]. The Honored Matres came into conflict with the Lost Tleilaxu, becoming their bitter enemies, in wars that spread across much of Scattering space. During this time the Tleilaxu refined the Futars, creating them for the express purpose of hunting Honored Matres. Nonetheless, the Matres managed to capture and enslave many Futars and Phibians.

==Return from the Scattering==
About 1,500 years after the death of God-Emperor Leto II, many of the Lost Ones began to return from the Scattering to the space of the Old Imperium. Chief among these were the [[Honored Matres]], who [[Return of the Honored Matres|carved a path of conquest]] wherever they went, and exterminated the Bene Tleilax and Bene Gesserit wherever they found them.

The Bene Gesserit eventually learned that the cause of this return was that the Honored Matres were fleeing an even more powerful adversary they encountered out in the Scattering, which the Honored Matres only briefly alluded to as "The [[Enemy]]" or "the Enemies of Many Faces".  The Matres had managed to steal some of the powerful [[Obliterator]] weapons from this Enemy before being easily overwhelmed. While the Honored Matres were fixated on destroying the Bene Gesserit, they were also determined to learn their methods of cellular control over their own metabolism which granted them immunity to disease and poisons - a skill that had atrophied among the Matres themselves when they split off from the Bene Gesserit. From this the Bene Gesserit also deduced that the Enemy the Matres were fleeing had made extensive use of biological warfare, against which the Matres no longer had adequate defenses.

==Behind the Scenes==
Within the context of [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] original novels, the Scattering occurs between the novels [[God Emperor of Dune (novel)|God Emperor of Dune]] and [[Heretics of Dune (novel)|Heretics of Dune]].

Atomics
[[Image:Atomic_explosion.jpg|thumb|Atomic explosion]]

{{Mixed}}
'''Atomics''', referred to the process of nuclear fission, and more specifically to nuclear weapons of mass destruction. A particularly famous type of atomic weapon was the [[stone burner]].

== Significance of Atomics ==

[[File:41et6RvLHFL-1.jpg|thumb]]

'''Atomics''' harbored a pronounced psychological and social stigma, and were rarely used due to traumatic historical events. Their prohibition was enforced by [[the Great Convention]], which dictated that the offensive use of atomics is grounds for planetary annihilation. Nonetheless, the Great Houses continued to stockpile atomics in the event that humanity ever encountered an alien intelligence that intended to do them harm.

Mankind's aversion to atomics came from their devastating use during the war against the [[Thinking Machines|thinking machines]]. Though many worlds were affected, the most notable ones were [[Earth]] and [[Corrin]].

== Actual or suspected use of atomics==
[[File:Dune-ccg-eye-of-the-storm-covert-venture-51r_51b-zHx5yeL-1.jpg|thumb]]
The actual and suspected use of atomics made several appearances throughout intergalactic history. Notable among these were the following critical events:
* The destruction of part of the [[Shield Wall]] by [[Paul Atreides]] just prior to the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], which led to the defeat of the forces of [[House Harkonnen]] and the [[Sardaukar]], and the [[the Ascension of House Atreides]].
* The destruction of part of [[Arrakeen]] by insurrectionists at the end of [[Paul Atreides|Paul Atreides']] reign as Emperor. This also resulted in [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] being permanently blinded.
* The destruction of all life on [[Earth]] shortly before the start of the [[Butlerian Jihad]].
* The destruction of the [[thinking machines]] and all biological life on numerous planets (excluding Earth) during the [[Great Purge]], a protracted campaign of the Butlerian Jihad.
* The destruction of [[Starda City]] on the planet [[Poritrin]] during the [[second slave revolt]]. While this was actually caused by the interaction of a laser on a [[Holtzman Shield]], it was commonly assumed to be caused by atomics.
* The ecology destruction of Salusa Secundus by [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/House_Tantor House Tantor] in the 2nd Millenium AG. For that reason the Imperial capital had to be moved to [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Kaitain/XD Kaitain].
*Also atomics were used during the destruction of [[Great_Spice_War#Korona|Korona]] during [[Shaddam IV]]'s [[Great Spice War]].

Futar

[[File:Chapterhousedune-2.jpg|thumb|Dune Chapterhouse book cover]]

'''Futars''' were a [[genetics|genetic]] human/feline hybrid created by members of the [[Bene Tleilax]] who had gone out into [[the Scattering]], allegedly as a tool for hunting down and destroying [[Honored Matres]] during a protracted and vicious war between the two groups. They are first mentioned briefly in ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' and then appear prominently in ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]''.  

However, Futars were brought into the [[known universe]] by the Honored Matres, who kept the creatures as pets. Though dangerous and harboring only sub-human intelligence they could be controlled through intimidation, sex, and emotional imprinting, typically by their owners or designated handlers.

Some Futars also found their way into urban areas on certain planets, such as [[Junction]], where they struggled to adjust to life free of a [[Handler]]'s guidance. [[Sheeana]] took 4 Futars with her during her escape from [[Chapterhouse]]. 

When the Honored Matres made the unusual step of capturing the water world [[Buzzell]] intact, the Bene Gesserit speculated that it was because the Honored Maters wanted to use it as a home for another slave race they had obtained, one that was an aquatic equivalent to Futars. These "[[Phibians]]" appear in the Expanded Dune books.

{{Quote| What sort of God would promise us land like this?| Zensunni lament}}
{{Quote| Home can be anywhere, for it is part of one's self| Zensunni saying}}

[[File:C306782831b898192fcecff680c9e755.jpg|thumb|Rogue Zensunni -Fanart]]


'''Zensunni''' was a religious belief system prominent with many cultures spread across the [[Known Universe]], especially those descended from disadvantaged and enslaved peoples.

== History ==
Little is known of the evolution of the Zensunni faith. What is beyond doubt is that the Zensunni belief was an amalgamation of two ancient religions: ''Sunni Islam'' and ''Zen Buddhism''.

They were followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of Maometh (the so-called "[[Third Muhammed]]") about [[1381 BG]]. The Zensunni religion 
is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to "the ways 
of the fathers." Most scholars name [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] as leader of the original 
schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male 
spokesman for his second wife, [[Nisai]].<ref>'''''[[Dune]]''''', '''Termiology of the Imperium, page 345'''</ref>

==Origins==
{{expanded}}
By the end of the [[Old Empire]] and the start of the [[Time of Titans]] Zensunnis thought the war was the prophesied [[Kralizec]], the End of the Universe, and they refused to battle. Instead they retreated to [[Unallied Planets|distant isolated planets]]. Yet that struggle had not ended according to the prophecy: the human race had survived the [[Thinking Machines]].

They had become a prominent belief system among many [[human]] cultures among the stars. However, the refusal of the Zensunni spiritual leaders to engage in active resistance against the enemies of free humanity resulted in a broad and angry backlash. Thus, for thousands of years practitioners of Zensunni, and its sibling faith [[Zenshiite]], were persecuted and enslaved by humans, as well as by [[Titans]] and [[Thinking Machines]].

As a result of being enslaved, [[Bel Moulay]] inspired the first revolt in [[Starda]], which was in turn crushed by Lord [[Niko Bludd]] and the [[Dragoon]] guards. [[Aliid]], a young slave who was torn from his parents, vowed for revenge. He was able to receive it decades after the first revolt. Aliid had planned a revolt while the nobles of the planet were celebrating. He managed to acquire an ancient [[lasgun]]. [[Tio Holtzman]] planned to protect himself from the revolt using one of his inventions, the [[Holtzman shield]]. Aliid intended to personally assassinate Holtzman. When the Savant saw the laser, he knew exactly what would happen, but Aliid did not. The whole city of Starda was vaporized by the sub-atomic explosion that is caused by a lasgun firing upon a shield.

Later, the Zensunni predisposition was manipulated by the [[Bene Gesserit]], via their [[Missionaria Protectiva]] arm and [[Panoplia Propheticus]] strategy, for their own political objectives. One of the most prominent homes of Zensunni beliefs, [[Arrakis]], was of particular interest in this regard. The exclusivity of the critical [[Spice Melange]] on the planet made the resident [[Fremen]], staunch followers of Zensunni, of natural interest to the Bene Gesserit.

The emergence of the powerful [[Paul Atreides]], and his adoption of Fremen ways, gave Zensunni beliefs a dramatic new popularity. After his ascension to [[Emperor]] Paul embarked on a ferocious jihad that brought great violence and turmoil. The stark contrast of these actions vis-à-vis pacifist Zensunni beliefs was not lost on some of the faithful.

== Core Beliefs ==
As a faith, Zensunni has the following core tenets:
* Belief in one, all-powerful [[Buddallah]], whose word is rendered by prophets;
* Aversion to violence, unless it is for self-protection and no other options remain;
* Belief in mystical interpretations of God's will.

== See also ==
* [[Budislamic]]
* [[Wandering Zensunni]]
* [[Zenshiite]]
* [[Zensufi]]

==References==
{{Reflist}}

== Behind the Scenes ==
The persecution or enslavement of the [[Wandering Zensunni]] by the [[League of Nobles]] and the [[Thinking Machines]] was specifically created in the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. References to harassment and persecution are found in [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] Dune novels.

'''Poritrin''' was the third planet in the star system [[Epsilon Ophiuchi]], and an established but largely quiet agricultural world within the [[Known Universe]].

==History==
During the [[Time of Titans]] and beyond, Poritrin was a member of the [[League of Nobles]]. It was ruled by a dynasty of [[Lord|Lords]] who were members of the [[Bludd]] family.

Following a bucolic derivative of [[Navachristianity]], the people of Poritrin outlawed computerized harvesting apparatus and restored society to humbler roots. Lord [[Sajak Bludd]] became the first Poritrin Lord and first League nobleman to introduce actual slavery, as a means of making large-scale agriculture viable. He justified his act by choosing only those who 'owed a debt to humanity' - the [[Buddislam|Buddislamics]].<ref>''[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]'', page 126</ref>

In the years that followed Poritrin became a staunch supporter of slavery. It's powerful agricultural and light industrial sectors became highly dependent on its large number of Zensunni and [[Zenshiite]] slaves.

During the unrest of the [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]], the planet was famous as the cradle of scientific celebrity [[Tio Holtzman]], the inventor of the [[Scrambler web]] and the [[Holtzman Effect]]. Technologies derived from the Holtzman Effect include the [[Spacefolder|Holtzman Drive]], [[Shield|Holtzman Shields]], [[Suspensors]] and [[Glowglobe|Glowglobes]]. 

[[Norma Cenva]] worked on Poritrin as assistant to Holtzman. Cenva would invent the portable [[scrambler grenade|Scrambler Grenade]] based off of the Scrambler Web technology invented by Tio Holtzman. Cenva then used the Holtzman Effect to invent the Suspensor field. Coupled with the common glow strips of the time, this evolved into the Glowglobe, which became the staple light source used throughout the [[Known Universe]]. Cenva gifted the discovery of the Glowglobe to her future husband [[Aurelius Venport]], CEO of [[VenKee Enterprises]]. With the help of Cenva, VenKee Enterprises would later become the [[Spacing Guild]].

During the Butlerian Jihad the planet experienced an uprising instigated by [[Bel Moulay]], a Zenshiite slave sage. However the uprising was violently suppressed by government forces led by [[Niko Bludd]], then ruler of Poritrin. Moulay was ceremonially tortured and executed in public in place of the uprisers.

About 20 years later, Poritrin was used as a 'bait' by the Jihadi intelligence, which lured a machine [[Attack on Poritrin|attack against the planet]]. According to the plan however, the planet was 'defended' by a large number of decoy ships that confused the machines and were driven off by real fighters. The mastermind of the plan was [[Vorian Atreides]], while the construction was overseen by Holtzman.

The second uprising culminated in a massive explosion that devastated Poritrin City, and greatly reduced the world's influence in galactic politics. Unlike his predecessor, [[Porce Bludd]] was a philanthropist and participated in building [[New Starda]].

Poritrin remained a source of resources for the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]], and continued to be home to 'slave pits' in which casualties were high.<ref>''[[Dune: House Harkonnen]]''</ref> The [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] remembered Poritrin as their planet of origin in their songs.

==Geography==
The planet was a river world featuring vast plains of fertile land and a healthy hydrological cycle. Though it was dotted with many settlements, by far the largest was [[Poritrin City]], which at its height was a hub of culture and luxury for free humans during the [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]].

Poritrin's capital was [[Starda]] built around the delta of the [[Isana]] River.

Poritrin had one small moon.

Junction
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:220px-Navigators_of_Dune_(2016)-1.jpg|thumb]]

The name '''Junction''' was used to refer to both multiple planets or planetary objects used for [[Spacing Guild]] operations, and to a primary center for Guild activity.

In the latter case, this main planet served as the headquarters for the Spacing Guild and its bank. It was also the location of the only [[Guild Navigator|Navigator]] school. The surface of the planet was almost completely covered with landing fields and repair bays for [[Heighliner]]s.

Junction was also the location of the Navigator's Field, where Guild Navigators who had died were memorialized.

It was conquered by the [[Honored Matres]] during the return from the [[Scattering]], and was the home of the [[Great Honored Matre]] and the location of the eventual [[Battle of Junction]].

Ginaz Swordmasters

'''Swordmaster''' is a title awarded to warriors attaining a certain level of skill in the [[Ginaz]] School, during the time of the [[Faufreluches]].

Conceivably, many [[House|Great Houses]] maintained their own Swordmasters as commanders, teachers, and personal guards for their family members.

Swordmasters of Ginaz were regarded superior warriors in every way, superior even to a [[Sardaukar]].

[[Duncan Idaho]] was Swordmaster for [[House Atreides]]. It was partially through his instruction that the Atreides were able to train a small army that rivaled the Sardaukar in ability in 10,191 A.G.

The name 'Swordmaster' comes from the fact that adepts are highly skilled in bladed weapons (namely [[knives]] and [[sword]]s) and hand-to-hand combat, which re-entered human warfare after shielding systems made the use of guns futile.

A '''starship''' was a space-faring vessel capable of travelling between [[stars|star systems]]. They typically travelled [[Space_travel#convential travel|close to light speed]], or used the [[Holtzman Effect]] to realize [[Space_travel#Faster than light travel|faster-than-light]] travel.

Starships were essential to humankind's colonization of the [[known universe]], and were critical to intergalactic transportation and communications for many millennia.

'''Spaceship''' often is used in a more generic sense for all types of spacecraft including shuttles and short-range planetary transports.

'''Supreme Bashar''' was a [[Military ranks|military rank]] bestowed upon those who were commanders of entire military forces. It was used in the [[Old Empire]] and restored by the [[League of Nobles]] and the [[Army of Humanity]] and passed in the time of the [[Faufreluches]] of the [[Imperium]]. It was also used later by the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]], and was carried over to the combined [[New Sisterhood]].

'''Hagal''', also known as the "Jewel Planet", was the second planet of the [[Stars#Theta Shaowei|Theta Shaowei]] star system. It was ruled by a [[County General]].

It was the planet where many of the precious crown jewels of the [[Known Universe]] originated from. Hagal was particularly famous for its [[soostone]]s and [[fire opal]]s.

Hagal was mined out completely in the time of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino I|Shaddam I]]. Subsequent emperors sat upon a throne made from a single piece of translucent blue-green Hagal quartz.

The planet Hagal was home of [[House Hagal]].

Kindjal
{{Mixed}}[[File:Kindjal 51swCdf_AOL-1.jpg|thumb|Kindjal]]
A '''Kindjal''' is a slightly curved double-edged long [[Blades|knife]] or short [[Blades|sword]], with a blade approximately 20cm long. Many family members of [[House|Great Houses]] were taught how to wield this weapon during the days of the [[Faufreluches]].

[[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] carried such a weapon on his person.

==Stats==

'''''Blade length:''''' ca. 20 cm

'''''Mass:''''' 0.25 - 0.3 kilograms

==Behind the Scenes==

The kindjal is modeled on the Caucasian ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanjali khanjali]'' (''kinzhal'' in Russian), a long-double edged knife part of traditional dress and often used in duels. Traditional kindjals often have a blade length of 42-55 cm, almost twice as long as the Kindjals of the Dune books.

In [[Expanded Dune]], the [[Kindjal (ship)|Kindjal]] is a type of fighter starcraft.

In Emperor: Battle for Dune game House Attreides is known to deploy kindjal infantry. These high tier infantry are armed with a pistol for mobile fighting and a heavy antimaterial rifle when in deployed formation.

It is unclear what [[Frank Herbert|Herbert]] meant by the kindjal being "double-bladed". If taken literally it suggests that the knife has two blades, one at each end of the hilt. However, Herbert's reference to "20 centimeters of slightly curved blade" seems to indicate that "double-bladed" means double-edged, or sharp on both sides. In addition, kindjals are never refered to elsewhere as having two blades, making the second explanation more likely.

Artificial intelligence
{{Mixed}}[[File:Vlcsnap-1011545.png|thumb|Thinking Machines]]
'''Artificial Intelligence''', also known as '''''AI''''', was a long-standing technological goal of mankind. It was realized inadvertently with the creation of the [[thinking machines]], whose destruction eventually came during the traumatic [[Butlerian Jihad]].

It was abandoned as a concept after the costly Jihad, and remained a pursuit that was actively condemned by the [[Landsraad]] via the [[Great Convention]]. Some groups, such as the [[Ixian]]s, secretly toyed with the concept, and in some cases came dangerously close to recreating sentient machines.

After the [[Kralizec]], humans resumed the cooperation with AIs, under the leadership of the fused Erasmus/Duncan Idaho.

Spice beer

'''Spice beer''' is an alcoholic beverage made with the [[spice melange]]. It was a favorite of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Elrood Corrino IX]].

A curious story existed that Elrood was assassinated via [[chaumurky]] in his spice beer, and that Count [[Hasimir Fenring]] was responsible. However, the unauthorised biography from which this story was taken, was also frequently discredited.

The '''Buddislamic''' faith was a broad, high-level belief system and cultural tradition that evolved through the joining of two ancient religions of [[Earth|Old Earth]]: Zen Buddhism and Islam. It had emerged as a consequence of the [[Second Islamic Movement|Second]] and [[Third Islamic Movement|Third Islamic Movements]].

== History ==
Pious adherents of two of the Buddislamic denominations, Zensunnis and Zenshiites, choose to flee from war when [[cymek]]s, [[robots]], and [[Thinking Machines|thinking machines]] rose up to conquer the [[Old Empire]] during the [[Time of Titans]]. The adherents fled due to mistakenly assuming that this was the long-foreteld [[Kralizec]], but many of the [[League of Nobles]] interpreted the fleeing as cowardice. With the human-machine war proving itself to not be Kralizec, most Zensunni and Zenshiite adherents still refused to participate, considering the war pointless. As a result, many members of the League, notably Savant [[Tio Holtzman]], still despised Zensunnis and Zenshiites a millennia later (notably purchasing many of them as [[solver]] slaves), claiming that they owed a debt to the rest of humanity. 

As a result of fleeing during the Time of Titans, and refusing to participate in the subsequent Jihad, Zensunni and Zenshiite adherents became scattered as separate communities on many planets of the [[Known Universe]], both League and Unallied ones. The most notable one of these communities was the [[Wandering Zensunni]] one, which, according to their own legends, originated on [[Nilotic al-Ourouba]] (likely the Nile Valley on [[Earth|Old Earth]]), and then migrated to [[Poritrin]], then [[Salusa Secundus]], [[Bela Tegeuse]], [[Rossak]], and [[Harmonthep]], before finally settling on [[Arrakis]] a roughly four generations prior to the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. This Zensunni community gradually evolved over the next few millennia - into the [[Free Men of Dune|Free Men]] (under [[Selim Wormrider]]), the [[Freemen of Dune|Freemen]], and, finally, the [[Fremen]].  

== Denominations ==
Within the [[Known Universe]] the Buddislamic tradition was broken into three denominations:
*[[Zensunni]]
*[[Zensufi]]
*[[Zenshia]]

The [[Zensunni]] denomination was historically the most commonly practiced. For a long time, it was marginalized and limited to groups such as the [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]], who evolved from the [[Wandering Zensunni]] of old. During the [[Butlerian Jihad]], the Zensunnis lived upon other planets as well, notably [[Harmonthep]], although these Zensunni were more pacifistic than the uncompromising and militaristic people of Arrakis. [[Paul Atreides]]' ascenscion to the title of [[Padishah Emperor]] and [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] saw an explosion in the denomination's popularity across the Known Universe.

The [[Zenshia]] demonination was, during the Jihad, a relative equal to Zensunni in popularity, even greater in numbers on the planet [[Poritrin]], in fact. However, over the subsequent millennia, the Zenshiite denomination faded, possibly out of existence. Much like the Zensunni of Arrakis, the Zenshiites of Poritrin and [[IV Anbus]] were rebellious, violent, and uncompromising.

The [[Zensufi]] denomination was a lesser practiced tradition. The Zensufi denomination survived mainly through the isolationist [[Bene Tleilax]] (formerly the Tlulaxa).

== Behind the Scenes ==
*The split of Buddislam into Zensunni, Zensufi and Zenshia seems to be modeled after historic Islam, however the names might simply refer to a neo-traditionalist, a purist or untenable faction and adherents of a majority faction and were not necessarily still very closely connected to either historic Terran Sunni, Sufi or Shia Islam (most Sufi-schools were parts of either Sunnitic or shiite traditions and not set apart from them as an independent third faction).

*Trike : Requires : Light Factory ¬¬Weapon : Trikes are lightly armored, three-wheeled vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns, effective against infantry and lightly armored vehicles. ¬¬Rate of Fire: 8 ¬¬Speed: 64 km/h ¬¬Armor: Light.  Trikes are vulnerable to most weapons, though high caliber guns are slightly less effective against them.

*Quad : Requires : Upgraded Light Factory ¬¬Weapon : Stronger than the Trike in both armor and firepower, the Quad is a four-wheeled vehicle firing armor-piercing rockets.  The Quad is effective against most vehicles. ¬¬Rate of Fire: 7 ¬¬Speed: 54 km/h ¬¬Armor: Light.  Quads are resistant to bullets and high explosives, to a lesser degree.  However, Quads are vulnerable to missiles and high caliber guns. 

*Combat Tank : Requires : Heavy Factory ¬¬Weapon: The Combat Tank is effective against most vehicles, less so against lightly armored vehicles. ¬¬ Rate of Fire : 4.5-5-6 ¬¬Speed: 40 km/h ¬¬Armor: Medium. Combat Tanks are very resistant to bullet and heavy explosives, but vulnerable to missiles and high caliber guns. This intelligence applies to the Atreides tank. The Harkonnen is stronger but slower and the Ordos faster but weaker, another Ordos Model uses Balistic Seeking Missiles but far more vulnerable.

*Ordos Combat Tank : Requires : Heavy Factory ¬¬Weapon: The Ordos Combat Tank is effective against all targets, mostly against lightly armored vehicles. ¬¬ Rate of Fire : 1.4 ¬¬Speed: 40 km/h ¬¬Armor: Medium. Ordos Combat Tanks are vulnerable to most weapons, though high caliber guns are slightly less effective.

*Siege Tank : Requires : Upgraded Heavy Factory ¬¬Weapon:   Siege Tanks are very effective against infantry and lightly armored vehicles - but very weak against heavily armored targets. ¬¬Rate of Fire:  2  ¬¬Speed: 30 km/h ¬¬Armor: Heavy.  Siege Tanks are resistant to bullets, and to some degree, high explosives. These units are vulnerable to missiles and high caliber guns.

*Missile Tank : Requires : Upgraded Heavy Factory and Ix Research Center. ¬¬Weapon:  It is anti-aircraft capable and effective against most targets, except infantry units. ¬¬Rate of Fire:  -2.50 ¬¬Speed: 36  km/h ¬¬Armor: Medium.  Missile Tanks are vulnerable to most weapons, though high caliber guns are slightly less effective.

*MCV : Requires : Heavy Factory and Repair Pad ¬¬Weapon: None.  The Mobile Construction Vehicle must be driven to a suitable deployment area.  After locating an appropriate area of rock, the MCV can be transformed into a Construction Yard. ¬¬Speed: 12  km/h ¬¬Armor: Medium.  MCVs are resistant to bullets and some high explosives. They are vulnerable to missiles and high caliber guns.

*Devastator : Requires : Heavy Factory and Ix Research Center ¬¬Weapon: The Devastator is the most powerful tank on Dune - powerfully effective against most units, but slow - and slow to fire.  Nuclear powered, the Devastator fires dual plasma charges and may be ordered to self-destruct, damaging surrounding units and structures.  ¬¬Rate of Fire: 1.50 ¬¬Speed: 12  km/h ¬¬Armor: The Devastator is very resistant to bullet and high explosives, but vulnerable to missiles and high caliber guns.

*Death Hand Missile : Requires : Harkonnen Palace ¬¬ Purpose : The Death Hand Missiles' warhead carries atomic cluster munitions. It detonates above the target, inflicting great damage over a wide area. ¬¬Build Time : 2 ¬¬Speed: 280 km/h ¬¬Armor: N/A.

*Ornithopter : Requires : Upgraded High Tech Factory ¬¬Weapon: The fastest aircraft on Dune, the Ornithopther is lightly armored and capable of dropping 500lb bombs.  This unit is most effective against infantry and lightly armored targets, but also damages armored targets. ¬¬Rate of Fire:  10 ¬¬Speed: 168 km/h ¬¬Armor: They are vulnerable to missiles and can only be hit by anti-aircraft weapons.

*Sonic Tank : Requires : Heavy Factory and Ix Research Center ¬¬Weapon: Sound.

[[File:51i_PxIVZXL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb]]

A '''Computer''' was a device capable of performing advanced calculations and in some cases sapient thought.

Due to their close association with [[thinking machines]], computers were deemed an unacceptable threat to [[human]]ity during the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. As a result there was an intelligence limit placed on them.

Crown Princess

[[File:51+yM6Ki-iL-1.jpg|thumb]]

A '''Crown Princess''' was the daughter of a [[Padishah Emperor]] of the Known Universe and his [[Empress Consort]], the wife or widow of the [[Crown Prince]], and the recognized heiress apparent to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. The title was historically only held by the members of the [[Corrino Empire]].


==The five most famous Crown Princesses== 

* [[Herade Corrino]] -- The beloved fiancee of the Imperial Crown Prince [[Raphael Corrino I]] who held the title for several decades, but he had his title was never withdrawn due to her late father-in-law, the Padishah Emperor [[Indriss Corrino I]]'s leadership on the planet [[Kaitain]]. 

* [[Anirul Corrino]] -- The most famous [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]] of the [[Hidden Noble Rank]] who married the 81st Padishah Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and became the mother of Irulan, [[Chalice Corrino|Chalice]], [[Wensicia Corrino|Wensicia]], [[Josifa Corrino|Josifa]], and [[Rugi Corrino|Rugi]] until she was killed by [[Piter de Vries]].

* [[Irulan Corrino]] -- The eldest daughter of the 81st Padishah Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] by his late wife, Lady Anirul Sadow-Tonkin Corrino. Her Extreme Imperial Highness briefly held the title of being the first-born Imperial Crown Princess on Kaitain a long time right before her parents' untimely suspicious death. Upon the apparent deaths of [[Paul Atreides]] and his wife,  on [[Arrakis]], she rose up to become the Supreme Padishah Goddess-Empress of the Known Universe.

* [[Chani Kynes]] -- A [[Fremen]] Princess who is the first-born daughter of the Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Liet Kynes]] and his wife, [[Faroula]], and the true consort of [[Paul Atreides]]. She was also the mother of [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], and the twins named [[Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]] until a maternal childbirth caused a fatal disease upon her death. 

* [[Ghanima Atreides I]] -- The youngest child of Paul Atreides and Chani Kynes, and the twin-sister and wife of Leto Atreides III, who was under the protective guardianship of her adopted stepmother, Irulan. Despite her aunt, [[Alia Atreides]] becoming the [[Abomination]], she spend more with her brother better than her childless concubine, Prince [[Farad'n Corrino]].

During [[Elrood Corrino IX]]'s rule, a soostone skimming operation took place, and a [[CHOAM]] scandal: a family of royal impersonators who disappeared to a rogue planet somewhere beyond Imperial control caused lost profits for Buzzell and the adjoining systems.<ref name="HA">''[[Dune: House Atreides]]''</ref>

It housed a [[Bene Gesserit]] Keep. As Buzzell was not a very hospitable world the Bene Gesserit punished those who refused to conform to their ideals by sending them there, including those who had committed the crime of love.

Buzzell was the first planet retaken from the [[Honored Matres]] by the [[New Sisterhood]] and their armada of [[no-ship]]s. On the planet the disgraced Reverend Mothers were rescued by the [[Mother Commander]] of the New Sisterhood and one was made overseer of the soostone harvesting, after argumentative Honored Matres were dealt with.

Later, [[Tylwyth Waff]] would release his [[seaworm]]s on Buzzell, causing devastation to the [[Soostone]] harvesting process.

Quintinius Violet Chenoeh
{{mixed}}

[[File:6bb0f41deed74f13b8b144d51e467322-1.jpg|thumb]]

Sister '''Quintinius Violet Chenoeh''' (13670-13728) was a [[Bene Gesserit]] Sister who became the focal point of one of the most persistent religious cults of post-[[Imperium]] history. Though she died during her attempt to become a [[Reverend Mother]], her name lived on as a particularly favored handmaiden of the [[God-Emperor]].

== History ==

=== Early Years ===

Chenoeh was born on [[Wallach IX]] to a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[proctor]]-aide, sister Alexius Gayle Chenoeh. Her father, Shimon Rasnic, was a servitor with [[House Corrino]].

Although born in the school hospital, Quintinius Violet Chenoeh was not considered a Bene Gesserit until she officially entered her training in the Sisterhood at five. The young Sister, in addition to the usual course given to Bene Gesserit acolytes, was assigned special tutoring in the areas of mnemonics, history, and psychology. The earliest reports on file from her teachers indicate that she fulfilled and exceeded their expectations in every area. Her removal from the school dormitories to private service with [[Reverend Mother]] Tertius Marie Hargus in her tenth year is a good indicator of her progress; such an assignment was most often made three to five years later in a student's career.

In 13686, Sister Chenoeh was taken on her first off-world journey, a trip to a Bene Gesserit conclave on [[Grumman]]. She served as personal aide to Reverend Mother Hargus, but her true function was that of apprentice recorder. (Another, more experienced sister was also part of the delegation and submitted her own report of events.) Her report, reviewed by a committee of proctors on the Wallach IX delegation's return, was considered satisfactory: while the sixteen-year-old had allowed an unfortunate amount of excitement to color her evaluations, her reportage of facts was nearly flawless. In those sections of the report in which R.M. Hargus had demanded she record speeches or papers verbatim, no error could be found. Only emotional reactions stood between the young sister and the level of expertise to which she might aspire. The Sisterhood was confident of their ability to remove those barriers, or force the girl over them. They had the knowledge of centuries of such manipulation, both in their files and in the memories of their Reverend Mothers.

The young mnemonist was frequently sent off-world after her initial assignment. By 13696, a decade after her first trip to Grumman, she was serving as senior recorder on some of the Sisterhood's most sensitive missions, including a "diplomatic" visit to [[Giedi Prime]] to revive another [[Cult of Alia]]. (The Cult would come to Leto II's attention in 13718 as the B.G.'s latest attempt to locate spice hoards. For over twenty years, however, the Sisterhood's hand in the revival would remain unknown).

Sister Chenoeh's services to the Bene Gesserit did not stop at those of recorder. In 13694 and again in 13710, she bore daughters as part of their breeding program. The elder girl, Clarisse, proved far less talented than her mother and was eventually married to a minor official in the God Emperor's court. The second daughter — unnamed — - was taken from her mother and killed by a delegation from the [[Fish Speakers]] garrison on Wallach IX only moments after her birth. Since the Sisterhood could not be certain of the reasons for Leto II's objection to the second birth, it was decided not to risk needlessly so valuable a member of the community. Sister Chenoeh had no more children.

=== Assignment to Lord Leto's Court ===
In 13722, she was sent as one of a pair of recorders to observe the [[God Emperor]] and his court on [[Arrakis]] in preparation for the Bene Gesserit's decennial report. (This report served in part to brief those who would form the Bene Gesserit Embassy to Leto II.) Along with her co-worker, Sister Tawsuoko, Sister Chenoeh confirmed the execution of the nine "false historians" the God Emperor had ordered in 12335; much of their case rested on a handwritten account of the incident penned by Ikonicre, the Lord Leto's [[majordomo]] in that year. Sister Tawsuoko, according to their report, was responsible for the document's discovery.

A chance for even more important discoveries was given Sister Chenoeh, however, when the God Emperor invited her on one of his infrequent peregrinations. At one point in their ramble along the Royal Road, the sister was invited to trot alongside the Royal Cart and converse personally with the God Emperor, an honor she immediately accepted.
It was during this brief walk that Sister Chenoeh was given the information which appears in the Welbeck Abridgment as well as that which was found among her papers after her death and assembled as the Chenoeh Report. The first, intended for immediate relay to her superiors, was a declaration of the God Emperor's knowledge and purposes: he used Sister Chenoeh to inform her [[Chapterhouse]] that he was aware of their attempts to suborn his Fish Speakers, that it was his intention to restore the "outward view" that humanity had lost, and that a parallel could be drawn between the Sisterhood's failed attempt to produce their [[Kwisatz Haderach]] and his own "achievement" of [[Siona Atreides|Siona]]. The second, secret message was far murkier and more troubling to the Sister. The Lord Leto described briefly the sensation of having been [[pre-born]], and the way in which he and his [[Ghanima Atreides|sister]] had learned to assert command over their "internal multitudes." He made one of the earliest known references to his [[Stolen Journals|secret journals]], explaining their function as a record for his posterity, millennia later. He also predicted — accurately — both his own evolution from living god to dead tyrant to living myth, and Sister Chenoeh's death prior to her reaching Reverend Mother status.

In a final bit of irony, the God Emperor suggested to Sister Chenoeh that her failure to become a Reverend Mother should not trouble her, because her status as an "integral part" of his myth would be far greater. Despite the
bitter message contained in those words, the Sister felt a peculiar sense of friendship between herself and the
Lord Leto and was not frightened by the prophecy. Nor, in obedience to his command, did she inform the Sisterhood of all that had passed between them. She carefully transcribed their dialogue and mixed the record of it in among her personal papers before returning to the Wallach IX school for debriefing, providing her superiors with only the "public" information. Her report was very well received.

=== The Failed Reverend Mother ===
Six years later she was recommended for initiation as a Reverend Mother. Even this news, which she could interpret only as a death sentence, could not provoke Sister Chenoeh to disobey. Following a day of meditation, and in the presence of all the Reverend Mothers of her Chapterhouse, Sister Chenoeh was given a drink containing a massive
dose of melange. The initiation went poorly from the beginning: instead of achieving the sense of heightened
awareness of self that the spice dose was intended to produce, Sister Chenoeh lost consciousness and slipped almost immediately into a deep coma. All efforts by her companions to revive her were useless. Her death, six hours after her ingestion of the drug, was attributed to "melange incompatibility," a reaction with which the Bene Gesserit were all too familiar.

Her private report was found when a group of her Sisters cleared her belongings from her quarters. Its contents were made known at once to the  Bene Gesserit hierarchy. Sister Chenoeh was forgotten, save by the Sisterhood, for almost nine hundred years. In 14715, however, with the establishment of the [[Church of the Divided God]], the Lord Leto's prediction of her place in his myth was proven true. Holy Sister Quintinius Violet Chenoeh, as she was now known, was seen as an enlightened visionary, a confidante of God. Shrines and churches were erected in her honor. Prayers to the Blessed Sister were popular among the devout.

=== Creation of the Myth ===
Among those familiar with antique religions, Sister Chenoeh was given another title. She was ''Auliya'', God's handmaiden in the [[Zensunni Wanderers]]' liturgy. It was widely believed that she had special influence over the [[Divided God]] and could intercede with him on behalf of her petitioners. Not even [[The Scattering]], sweeping as it was, could entirely dissolve the Cult of Sister Chenoeh. Let the Church authorities lecture as they would concerning the Sister's mortal status; the faithful would listen, nod where necessary, and return to their devotions as if nothing had been said. Her churches were torn down or rededicated. The Bene Gesserit permitted Church elders access to their records to provide confirmation that this "Holy" member of their Order had worked no wonders, performed no miracles. (By this time, the Sisterhood was as worried by the attention their charismatic member had drawn to herself, and them, as was the Church.) Still the Cult persisted.

It could be argued that the discovery of the God Emperor's Journals gave a measure of justification for this tenacity. While Sister Chenoeh saw herself as no more than a simple oral recorder, however talented, and a loyal Bene Gesserit above all, mentions of her in the Journals indicate that the Lord Leto saw her as something more. A few lines from one of the last entries, believed to have been made only days before the God Emperor's death, conveyed that vision: ''"This silence from the Bene Gesserit puzzles me. They must certainly have found Sister Chenoeh's records by this time, and yet they say nothing, ask nothing, demand nothing. I remember how quickly Luyseyal and Anteac came before me to claim their reward after informing my Fish Speakers of the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] plot and marvel at the Sisterhood's present shyness. For that one Sister, I would be willing to confer greater treasures on them than they dare to dream. She has begun the work my journals will finish."''

Fifteen hundred years after her death during the spice agony, Chenoeh's bust adorned the halls of the main building at [[Chapterhouse]].

Azhar Book/XD
{{Mixed}}

[[File:IrulanCorrino1.jpg|thumb]]

The '''Azhar Book''' is a [[Bene Gesserit]] compilation of religious and bibliographic information. Supposedly it preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths.

It was a bibliographic marvel that preserved the great secrets of the most ancient faiths, even before the [[Orange Catholic Bible/XD|Orange Catholic Bible]]. The creation of the Azhar Book is also attributed to the Bene Gesserit.

==History==
The Azhar Book was written in the [[Azhar]] language. A copy of it was already in the possession of the [[Sorceresses]] of [[Rossak/XD|Rossak]]. [[Zufa Cenva]] had one in her room.

It was noted that a copy of the Azhar Book was on display in the [[Ishaq Hall of Magnificent Documents]] on [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]].

[[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]] noted that a [[Fremkit]] manual read like the Azhar Book, and therefore a [[Missionaria Protectiva|Manipulator of Religions]] had been on Arrakis.

[[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] quoted from the Azhar Book when discussing with [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] their suspicions about their aunt [[Alia Atreides|Alia]]:
{{quote|It is with reason and terrible experience that we call the pre-born [[Abomination]]. For who knows what lost and damned persona out of our evil past may take over the living flesh?|}}

Leto later noted that the watering-place of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas St. Thomas] was preserved in the Orange Catholic Bible and the Azhar Book.

==Paul Atreides and the Azhar Book==

[[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides]] said words traced back to ancient texts of the Azhar Book:

;Muad'Dib: "Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future."
;C.E.T. Commentaries: Identical wording. (The Azhar Book traces this statement to the first century religious writer, [[Neshou]]; through a paraphrase.)

;Muad'Dib: "If a child, an untrained person, an ignorant person, or an insane person incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not predicting and preventing that trouble."
;O.C. Bible: "Any sin can be ascribed, at least in part, to a natural bad tendency that is an extenuating circumstance acceptable to God." (The Azhar Book traces this to the ancient [[Semitic Tawra]].)

;Muad'Dib: "Reach forth thy hand and eat what God has provided thee; and when thou are replenished, praise the Lord." 
;O.C. Bible: a paraphrase with identical meaning. (The Azhar Book traces this in slightly different form to [[First Islam]].)

Bene Gesserit Training
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Bene_gesserit.jpg|thumb|Bene Gesserit Dune CCG]]

The essence of the [[Bene Gesserit]] training philosophy was that, if one could control oneself, or "know thyself," ultimately one could control the universe. Its first axiom was ''"My mind controls my reality."'' The training itself was based on a series of progressive exercises, lasting approximately 10 years, which gave the student power to control herself mentally, physically, and psychologically, and to control others. This control was used not to withdraw to an internal fantasy world, but rather to observe and understand reality with detached objectivity. Thus, the [[prana]]-[[bindu]] training, begun, if possible, during the child's first year of life, assured the candidate that mastery of herself was mastery of illusion, both of her own and of other people's as well.

== Underlying Philosophies ==
Studying the details of Bene Gesserit training would allow one to understand why the Sisterhood acquired a reputation as keen analysts, expert "seers," and fearsome fighters. The "weirding ways" seen by outsiders were actually the results of a long process of self-discipline which developed the ability to analyze and synthesize information not only in an environment of peace but also under stress. Two precepts in Bene Gesserit training highlighted this philosophy. The first showed the necessity of discipline: ''"To use raw power is to make yourself infinitely vulnerable to greater powers"'', and the second dealt with practical application of the training: ''"The mind can go in either direction under stress - toward positive or toward negative: think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end."'' Thus the goal of the training was to ensure that the adept would have her power under control whatever the situation. However, there was a fatal weakness inherent in this training: great control could lead to great confidence, to overconfidence, and finally, to an ultimate loss of objectivity - to vanity and pride. Therefore candidates were continually evaluated and given tasks which forced them to work with people more skilled than themselves, and some exercises were specifically designed to prevent vanity about the student's growing strength. For example, the third-year training section opened with this caution: ''"All proof inevitably leads to propositions which have no proof. All things are known because we want to believe in them."''

== Notions of God ==
One important omission in all of the training was ethical or moral philosophy or theology. The Bene Gesserit was always known publicly as a religious order, a mystic Sisterhood which espoused a belief in the supernatural control of the "Great Mother". None of their instructional material ever referred to a transcendent force or being. In fact, in the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] material, religion was described as ''"the purposeful instruction of the masses."'' The text described thousands of religio-mythic variations on the theme of supreme, non-human power, but no evidence indicated that the Sisterhood believed in any ultimate power other than that of its own goal, the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. The idea of God was used more as a mascot than as a deity. This atheistic tendency developed sometime after the [[Butlerian Jihad]], but the Sisterhood was never actually a religious organization to begin with.

==Other Memory==
One of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]] is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken. The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's ego is always dominant. The first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory was [[Raquella Berto-Anirul]], the founder of the order.

A Reverend Mother has access only to her female lineage in Other Memory; her male line is unavailable to her, present as a dark void that terrifies her. Until the time of God Emperor of Dune, the purpose of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme is to breed a [[Kwisatz Haderach]], a male with Other Memory who can see both lines, male and female. Male memory will be complete until moment of conception, when physical contact with the father, through ejaculation, is lost.

Reverend Mothers may also pass their own ego/memory combination to other Reverend Mothers at will, merely by touching foreheads. When a Reverend Mother dies in the presence of another Reverend Mother, the second will accept the ego/memory of the first to prevent the loss of the dying Reverend Mother's experience and ancestral memories. Especially when the Mother Superior perishes, it is important to take her ego/memory so that her plans and strategies may continue uninterrupted.

== Mind and Body ==
A two-part training program was pursued simultaneously by a candidate: the training of the mind and the training of the body. Thus a small child would spend hours learning the many languages in use in her culture, and later spend more hours sitting rock-still, lowering her body temperature or slowing her heartbeat, moving one muscle at a time as she catalogued the stimulus/response pattern of her body. The physical training program, the prana-bindu school, was perhaps the best way to illustrate the unification of these two primary branches of training.

The basic premise of the training was that found in an ancient Terran religion in which the path to the truth was called “Sabda” and closely resembled what is known to the Bene Gesserit as the "Way." Sabda allowed an internal realization of truth which identified the knower with an immutable reality. The Bene Gesserit Way also identified the knower with reality, but denied immutability. Thus the Bene Gesserit axiom: ''"The purpose of argument is to change the nature of truth."'' The same conditioning processes, however, were used to attain both Sabda and the Way. The key to both was achieving harmony and tranquility through establishing balance within the individual. This balance was achieved through “tapas”: austere regimens which controlled and organized the psychic and physical forces of the body, and concentrated one's powers; and “upsana”: the meditation which allowed one to go deep within oneself to find the link between the internal forces, the point of balance between knowing the body and knowing the mind.

The mental self was trained through “nayana” - a discipline which controlled reasoning. Nayana paired linguistics and logic in order that the individual could distinguish between language and meaning. The student was constantly taught that a sentence meant more than the meaning of the individual words, that it included the physical activity which accompanied the act of speaking. The observer, therefore, had to be able to "read" and "register" the gestalt of the speaker, had to be able to understand the linguistic patterns of thought conveyed through the immediate language, and had to be able to synthesize all these channels instantly in order to understand completely what actually was being "said." Thus, in the process of learning, the student had to completely control the internal sources - her own physical, mental, and emotional condition at the time of synthesis - and totally perceive the external sources - the environment of the speaker, the physical and psychic gestalt of the speaker, the cultural undertones of the language, and the actual overtones of the word sets being used. In general, this technique of data collection, synthesis, and understanding was perfected after the Butlerian Jihad. The aim was to replace [[thinking machines]] with people who were not only capable of instantaneous logic computations, as were the machines, but who were also able to assimilate sensory and emotional information. Through a rational/intuitive process, such people would come to conclusions that were human rather than mechanistic but objectively detached rather than egotistically biased.

=== Prana-Bindu ===
Specifically, [[prana]] (Breath) and [[bindu]] (muscle) training prepared one for the state of concentration needed to understand the reality of a situation. This state of concentration was also essential to the Bene Gesserit observational skills and martial art techniques. To gain the proper attitude for complete concentration, one had to first remove oneself, mentally if not physically, from all distractions. To do this one used relaxation techniques
which eliminated the distraction from extraneous stimuli. At this point in her studies, the student also learned how to distinguish primary information from secondary or unessential information - "to see the facts and discard the [[ghafla]]." Once one has relaxed and had begun to observe the proper information, one had to learn to observe closely and clearly. In this state of observation one assimilated pertinent data from the present situation and recalled all pertinent data from memory without error.

If possible, the observer next assumed a positive physical posture of relaxation and concentration. When the analytical work was being done under private, leisurely conditions, the person relaxed in one of thirty-three postures, each appropriate to a specific type of analytical work. In public situations, the observer assumed an immediate but unobtrusive ritualistic posture which called the muscles and tissues into alertness. If under great stress or immobilized, one could alter this posture to accommodate the restraints. Next, one began controlled breathing for concentration, relaxation, and an oxygen supply sufficient to support accelerated mental activity. Finally, as the last step before entering the concentration mode one withdrew sensory and emotional awareness from all internal areas of distraction. In most cases the adept performed a simple calmness ritual, but in great danger, she recited the [[Litany Against Fear]] to subdue any instinctual, primal terror, particularly one stimulated by a race memory fear:

''"I must not fear.&nbsp; Fear is the mind killer.&nbsp; Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.&nbsp; I will face my fear.&nbsp; I will permit it to pass over me and through me.&nbsp; And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.&nbsp; Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.&nbsp; Only I will remain."''

At this point, the observer could begin the concentration mode. The concentration mode involved three stages of observational analysis. First, one had to severely limit the attention to only the past and present data concerning the topic. Second, one had to enter a state of total contemplation in which the attention flowed in a steady stream over the topic - the observer completely enclosing the topic. Third, one had to be conscious not of the techniques of observation, not of the presence of self, but of the topic - one had to become the topic. At the moment of unity, the observer understood the topic as she understood herself. Thus, all knowledge depended on the observation of detail and on one's body being trained to support close observation, on objective classification and cataloguing, and on maximum retention of data. Only complete control of nerves and tissues, muscles, blood and chemistry, could detach one enough from the demands of the self to allow objective detachment during the observation, analysis, and synthesis process. The control of the body led to the purification of the mind necessary to separate the real from the unreal.

Although the process of preparation, control, and analysis seemed complicated and time consuming, after a woman had trained for ten years, first in the separate steps and then in the entire process, she could, if necessary, perform the entire function in less than a second. One of the controls learned is the ability to release oneself from the artificial confines of the human notion of "time." There was no "time" in the concentration mode - all activities could be managed simultaneously.

Once the basic processes had been mastered, second-level functional states could be invoked such as “Dao”, “Prajna”, and “Adab”.

*'''Dao''' was the dormancy trance, a type of bindu suspension in which an adept could slow her physiological activities to a level just on the edge of life-maintenance, a trance useful for survival under threatening conditions and also necessary to rejuvenate cells. A Sister can completely control her breathing and heart rate to the degree that she can appear dead to most tests even after intense physical exertion.  Prana-bindu control could heal wounds. They can control their need for food and water to the extremes of hunger and thirst, and even commit suicide at will by simply stopping their hearts. The Bene Gesserit knew their cellular structure so intimately that they could analyze and neutralize most poisons within their bodies. It is hinted that should a Bene Gesserit wish to, she could slow her aging process dramatically, controlling every aspect of her metabolism. Of course, no Bene Gesserit would ever do this, as it would call too much attention to the Sisterhood and reveal too much of their abilities. 

*'''Prajna''' meditation trance was used for deep understanding and for the special state of "seeing" some Sisters were capable of performing (a state usually augmented with enhancement by chemicals such as melange). Bene Gesserit are trained to exercise petit perception at all times, noticing to a terrifying degree minutiae that others miss. When combined with their analytical abilities, Bene Gesserit appear to be witches (hence the nickname for them), capable of divining secrets in persons and circumstances that are invisible to everyone else. Slight differences in air currents or the design of a room will allow a Bene Gesserit to detect hidden portals and spyholes; variations in a person's voice and tiny reactions allow Bene Gesserit to deeply understand a person's emotional state, and manipulate it. Bene Gesserit trained as Truthsayers are able to detect whether someone is lying by detecting inflection and change in a subject's voice, observing and interpreting their body language and analyzing physical signs like pulse and heart rate. Such perception of someone else's veracity is an ability that all humans have, in principle, but that requires extensive training to develop to the point of usefulness.

*'''Adab''', on the other hand, was a retrieval process accessible to all skilled Bene Gesserits; this state of recall was also called the "demanding memory," a recollection of necessary data stimulated externally or by the gestalt of a situation rather than being triggered consciously by the woman herself. Adab was different from the "consciousness impression/complete recall" method used regularly to store and process data. The normal mnemonic process allowed complete reproduction of any conversation, even simulating the tone and pitch control of the original speaker (a practice always used by Sisters or acolytes who acted as messengers). But Adab not only stored material in the subconscious, it also used the subconscious to integrate new with stored data, thus producing completely accurate and logically assimilated memory, a memory so strong that when stimulated it would overwhelm the woman's consciousness.

===Internal Organic-Chemical Control===
Just as the Prana-bindu allows the Bene Gesserit to precisely control each muscle and nerve, they also have complete conscious control over the functions of their internal organs and body chemistry. The Bene Gesserit are therefore immune to poisons, as they can simply change the chemical makeup of any harmful substance in their body and render it harmless. One of the most significant biological abilities of the Bene Gesserit is their control their own menstrual cycles, and their ability to control (at conception) their child's gender. The great test of this ability occurred during a woman's initiation as a Reverend Mother in metabolizing the "Water of Life" within her system. Occasionally, Sisters were unable to metabolize it, and they died. Thus, those women who accomplished this were testaments to the mastering of these abilities.

===Simulflow===
Bene Gesserit also have the ability to practice simulflow, literally the simultaneous flow of several threads of consciousness at any given time; mental multitasking, as it were. The combination of simulflow with their analytical abilities and Other Memory is responsible for the frightening intelligence of the average Bene Gesserit.

== The Weirding Ways of Combat ==
Prana-bindu training was also used by the adept in all the daily functions of her life. For example, the famous Bene Gesserit martial art, the "weirding ways of battle," were only accomplished after years of prana-bindu training. The hand-to-hand combat techniques depended upon supreme muscle control for their astonishing force and speed. Not only the unarmed combat maneuvers, but also their extraordinary [[knife]] and whip techniques, required the total command of muscle and nerve.

==Sexual Imprinting==
The Bene Gesserit are notable for their extensive skill in seduction, sex and sexual imprinting. The most talented and highly-trained are known as Imprinters. Men in a position of power or future power, or those with specific qualities that the order wishes to incorporate into their breeding program, are typical targets of a Bene Gesserit imprinter. Men seduced by an imprinter are permanently affected (imprinted) by the intense sexual experience and are thereafter consciously or subconsciously favorable to the Sisterhood.

== Manipulation of Others ==
The training program had a second objective: the ability to control others whether as individuals, masses, or cultures.

===The Voice===
The Bene Gesserit was taught to "read" and "register" a person in order to manipulate him/her by “Voice”. In "reading" one observed and identified the clue tones which would control the other person. In "registering" one used a brief mnemonic trance to retain the clue tones, making that person controllable in future situations. Finally, through the use of decipherment, a Bene Gesserit could recognize a registered individual no matter what overt change in behavior or appearance they assumed. Decipherment also allowed sisters to unerringly identify [[Face Dancers]] and [[ghola]]s, even when they assumed the appearance of individuals unknown to the Sister herself. The decipherment pattern allowed her to discern the nonhuman characteristics, as well as read pheromones. Through Voice, a subtle manipulation of vocal tones, a Bene Gesserit could manipulate individuals or large groups by triggering clue tones. Certain voice patterns triggered primal human responses, and the registered person could be controlled in any situation. Women specially gifted with The Great Control could manage any number of people in any situation, and could even control other Bene Gesserits. Particular subtleties of Voice usage are the Lie Adroit - manipulation through concealed falsehood; the Zensunni Codex - a play of words that confused or obscured the truth; and the implantation of autosuggestive cue words (for example, the most common word thus implanted is "Uroshnor," a word itself empty of meaning, but which, when spoken, triggered a state of immobilization). These techniques, however, were taught only for specific professional work.

===Missionaria Protectiva===
In order to learn how to control large groups of people and even cultures, during her final three years of education a candidate entered a series of courses teaching the characteristics of mob behavior (e.g., history, politics, anthropology, and mythology). Unless a woman was to be a political determiner when she graduated or was being groomed for political roles within the order, these courses were theoretical. For those who entered the Missionaria Protectiva, however, a special training program taught the manipulation of cultural attitude through mythos implantation. Truthsayers, economists, and women preparing to be MBA’s were all trained in practical group manipulation as well as in theory.

== Survival ==
Of course, as a secondary part of the entire training program, candidates were also taught survival techniques. For example, a rudimentary course was "Hand and Finger Signals," while a more advanced course in the same discipline was "Tactile Encoding Methods." The techniques of setting and breaking palm locks were designated as an advanced course that would allow a Reverend Mother or other Sister to communicate, undetected by use of these hand signals. For example, if a Reverend Mother were to be held captive and watched by guards (as we see during the conversation with Reverend Mother Mohaim and Princess Irulan Corrino as they discuss the plan to prevent Chani from conceiving) her Simulflow and these hand gestures, used in proper synchronicity, could conduct an entirely and completely undetected separate conversation, whilst the Reverend Mother or Adept verbally could be discussing the weather on Arrakis. Primary regimens such as the waiting stance, the sense-cleansing regimen, and the tranquility mode were also taught.

==General Overview==
In general, the students were taught practical skills for the primary Bene Gesserit occupations of breeding and espionage. The prana-bindu skills, the observational and analytical skills, and the self-preservation skills were all bases on which to develop the theoretical abilities needed in an organization whose goal was the accumulation and manipulation of economic and political power.

The planet '''Rossak''' was the fifth planet in the star system [[HD95424]]. It was the fourth stop of [[Zensunni Wanderers]] during their forced migration times, and where a [[Awareness spectrum narcotic]] that released the [[Other Memories]] of their [[Sayyadina]]s was discovered.


==Notoriety==
In [[10191 AG]], the [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]] experienced memories of Rossak when she underwent the [[spice agony]] on [[Arrakis]]. During the ceremony, Jessica successfully changed the [[Water of Life]] poison, thus unlocking her [[Other Memory|Other memories]]. It was during the induced trance that she recalled moments, through Other Memory, of the original [[Zensunni Wanderers]] on the planet [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]], as well as [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] women taking [[awareness spectrum narcotics]] that unlocked [[genetic memory]] for the first time.

The Fremen of Arrakis would recall the raiders pursuing them on Rossak, through courtyards lush with greenery. This recollection would normally take place during a ceremony, along with the raids on Poritrin and [[Bela Tegeuse/XD|Bela Tegeuse]]. The ceremony would normally involve the [[Sayyadina]], and the words ''"We will never forgive and we will never forget"''.

==Environment==
It was a world barely capable of accommodating humans, due to the toxic atmosphere, and volcanic geology that covered all but its equator.

Despite its natural riches, and the protection offered by the planet's equatorial silvery-purple jungles, the Rossak environment still had a devastating effect on its wider human population. Genetic damage was a common problem, and left many newborn humans either still-born or burdened with serious genetic defects.

==History==
Rossak was once visited by the Zensunnis, but they eventually were expelled by raiders.

The planet was later most famous for being the home of the [[Sorceresses of Rossak]], a culture of telekinetic women who came into being thanks to the planet's torrid environment. Rossak was also well known for the diverse and pharmaceutically rich flora that grew in its habitable zone. Such was the potential of the native plants of Rossak that groups made a healthy living harvesting and selling them throughout the [[League of Nobles]]. The most famous of such entrepreneurs was [[Aurelius Venport/XD|Aurelius Venport]].

Prior to the Jihad, Rossak was [[assault at Rossak|assaulted]] by [[Cymek]]s who wanted to exterminate the Sorcesses as a retaliation for the loss of [[Barbarossa]] but they were repelled. Rossak again was one of the planets who suffered by the [[Omnius Scourge]].

After the Jihad, Rossak was again a target of the [[piranha mites]], a new assault by besieged [[Omnius]]. The danger was soon eradicated, but a new strain of the Scourge, the [[Rossak Epidemic]], made its appearance, mutated in the hazardous rich environment of the planet.

The nebulous [[Bene Gesserit|Sisterhood]], under [[Mother Superior/XD|Reverend Mother Superior]] [[Raquella Berto-Anirul|Raquella]], abandoned the planet in favor of the more benign, but still uncomfortable [[Wallach IX/XD|Wallach IX]].

Sandrider
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Otheym (Dune CCG, art by Mark Zug).jpg|thumb]]

'''Sandrider''' is the [[Fremen]] term for one who is capable of capturing and riding one of the great [[sandworm]]s of [[Arrakis]].

A Sandrider ready to catch a sandworm was called a Hookman, and a Sandrider riding a worm was called a Worm-Steersman.

In order to lead the Fremen, [[Paul Atreides]] had to become a sandrider. Normally, Fremen become sandriders by the age of twelve.

===Original Sandrider===

According to the [[Legends of Dune]] trilogy, the first Sandrider was a young [[Zensunni]] named Selim. Selim was exiled from his [[Sietch]] for water theft. However, Selim was not guilty of the crime but set up by a son of an elder village member. During his exile, Selim learned that if the segments of a worm were separated, then the worm would roll to keep the open wound from the abrasion of the sand. Using a small metal rod at first, Selim rode an ancient worm until the creature died. After several more rides, Selim decided it was not necessary to drive each worm he rode to death by exhaustion. He would then allow the worm to live, while he scurried to nearby rock formation to survive. Eventually, young Selim became known as [[Selim Wormrider]].

Lisan al Gaib
[[File:Dune-ccg-thunder-at-twilight-lisan-al-gaib-voice-of-the-outer-worlds-117i_51AQ2DbMagL-1.jpg|thumb]]


'''Lisan al Gaib''' is the [[Fremen]] term for an off-world prophet or messiah. The term comes from the Arabic, "لسان," (Lisan) meaning "Tongue," and "الغيب" (al Gaib) meaning "The hidden" or "unseen". It should be noted that in context of Islam, "الغيب" (al Gaib) signifies the 'unseen dimensions of Reality', and the "tongue of the unseen" is a "prophet", and not a "foreigner".

It is "The Voice from the Outer World" and is outlined in Fremen messianic legends heavily influenced by the [[Bene Gesserit]]'s [[Missionaria Protectiva]]. It is also translated as the "Giver of Water." 

[[Paul Atreides/2021 film|Paul Atreides]] suggests that the term means that the Bene Gesserit have been planting superstitions of The One, but Jessica remarks that they have been preparing the Fremen for the arrival of The One.<ref>''[[Dune (2021 film)]]''</ref>

Beginning in [[Original Dune|The Original Dune]], [[Paul Atreides]] is often referred to as the Lisan al Gaib by the [[Fremen]]. This is first seen when the Atreides arrive on Dune and are ‘touring’ the capital.

Also the great persian poet "Hafiz" (1315-1390) whose Poems have spiritual and religious depth was called by this Nickname.

Wormrider

'''Wormrider''' refers to those who mastered the skill of calling, climbing, and riding a [[Sandworm]] of [[Arrakis]]. 

The name referred also to the followers of the original ''wormrider'', [[Selim Wormrider]]. They were the precursors of the [[Fremen]]. The Wormriders were [[Buddislamics]] who revered [[Shai-Hulud]] as a manifestation of [[Buddallah]]. They shared Selim's vision and ideals and were tasked to disrupt the commercialization of [[Spice]].

There were few non [[Fremen]] '''wormriders'''. Most notably [[Gurney Halleck]] who rode worms while in service of [[Lady Jessica]].

''Varota'' lived during the time of [[Leto Atreides I]], a time where the art of baliset was declining. He was disappointed by the loss of apprentices applying to his studio.

His birth town on Chusuk planned an annual baliset festival in honor of him hoping to spur interest in the baliset again.

==Apocrypha==

In the [[Dune: Chronicles of the Imperium|Dune RPG]], "House Varota" was considered one of the [[Great Houses]] and the ruling house of Chusuk.The Game also gives the original Varota's full name as "Angostin Varota".

Nullentropy
{{Mixed}}
'''Nullentropy''' is a wide spread storage technology in the [[Dune]] universe. Any item may be preserved indefinitely inside a ''Nullentropy'' capsule or container. 

== Various Uses ==
In [[Heretics of Dune]], [[Duncan Idaho]] and [[Miles Teg]] survived hidden in the [[No-chamber]] of [[House Harkonnen]], fully stocked with provisions and weapons stored in the '''nullentropy''' system.

Later in the [[Sequels of Dune]] novel, [[Hunters of Dune]], it is revealed that the [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale]] contains a nullentropy tube of [[ghola]] cells of important persons of yesteryear, stored within his body. The cells within the apparatus are perfect and readily usable, since no time has passed within the tube.

The same occurs on the [[Tleilaxu]] city of [[Bandalong]], when rummaging through the body of a dead Tleilaxu Master, the [[Honored Matres]] leader, [[Hellica]], and her slave assistant [[Uxtal]] find a functioning nullentropy tube.

Chapterhouse Keep

'''The Keep''' on '''Chapterhouse''' was the central hub all of Sisterhood activity during the '''[[Return of the Honored Matres]]''' and the advent of '''[[Kralizec]]'''.

After '''[[The Scattering]]''', the Bene Gesserit's decided to continue to make [[Chapterhouse]] their permanent base of operations. The central located building on Chapterhouse housed the nerve center of the organization -- '''The Keep'''. A series of one to four story buildings, the sprawling complex blended in, and became one with the '''natural flora''' and '''fauna''' that surrounded it.

'''The Keep''' housed all of the barracks that the '''[[sister]]s''' and '''[[acolyte]]s''' lived in, as well as the extensive library on human genetics and breeding patterns for the previous fifteen thousand years. Other parts of '''the Keep''' included the Sisterhood's school, weapons training facilities, and private quarters for the Gesserit's [[Reverend Mother]]s and other leaders.

The '''entire complex''' was built to be able to be packed and moved to another part of the world, or off-world, in a very short time, if needed.

After the merger of the Bene Gesserits with the Honored Matres, which produced the '''[[New Sisterhood]]''', the Keep was kept as the organization's headquarters.

Spaceport

A '''spaceport''' was the place on a [[planet]] where off-world traffic would take off to travel into interstellar realms. Although there were some places where star-ward traffic would sometimes take off particular planets, by the time of the [[Corrino Empire]], using spaceports was strongly encouraged; as all interstellar travel was heavily regulated by the [[Guild]]; and most craft were heading to rendezvous with [[heighliner]]s.

Handler/XD
{{mixed}}
A '''Handler''' was most likely a special type of human created by the [[Tlulaxa/XD|Tleilaxu]] to care for and breed [[Futar]]s, in their war against the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] out in Human Scattering-space. For the futars who found themselves encaptured and imprisoned on the [[no-ship]] kept on [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]], they constantly clamored in their need to find "their Handlers".

Handlers were taller than most humans, had a keen sense of smell; and had darkened pigmentation around the eyes, akin to raccoons.

==[[The Planet of the Handlers]]==
When the same no-ship, the ''[[Ithaca]]'', found itself above an arboreal and lush world after a [[prescience]]-guided jump by the [[ghola]] of [[Miles Teg/XD|Miles Teg]], the futars aboard the vessel began acting nervously, and [[Hrrm/XD|Hrrm]], their leader declared they had come to 'home', the home planet of the Handlers and Futars.

The leader of the Handlers on that particular part of the planet was named [[Orak Tho]], and he invited the landing party of the ''Ithaca'' to observe a hunt of the Honored Matres, and invited the ''Ithaca'' futars to participate in the hunt. After the futars killed some Honored Matres, the Matres ended up killing one of the Handlers, who in actuality turned out to be and [[Enhanced Face Dancer]], under the control of the [[Thinking Machine]] leaders [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]].

It is not know if all Handlers were Enhanced Face Dancers, or if some Enhanced Face Dancers had been strategically placed by the Machines, on the Handler home world.

Phibian
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-14-02-33-00-1.png|thumb]]


'''Phibians''' are a genetically-engineered humanoid sub-race race first mentioned in ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]''.  They are primitive humanoid fish creatures brought as captives to the "million planets" by the [[Honored Matres]], much as the felinoid [[Futars]] were.  They appear in ''[[Hunters of Dune]]''.

Phibians are genetically wrought humanoids, a mingling of human and fish with a limited capacity for intelligence and vocabulary. Created out in [[The Scattering]], they have bullet-shaped heads, with lean and streamlined bodies taller than humans, and slick green skin that 'shines with oily iridescence'.  

===Bene Gesserit Overseers===
On the ocean world of [[Buzzell]], the Honored Matres used the Phibians as overseers for the [[Bene Gesserit]] slaves, as well as to retrieve [[soostone]]s from the sea, by prying open [[Cholister]] mussels. As the Phibians are capable of breathing underwater as well as on land, they can dive deeper and farther from shore than any human can.  

{{XD|The Phibians like [[Spice Melange|spice]], and for years traded soostones for spice with smugglers.  After the [[New Sisterhood]] re-conquered Buzzell, [[Murbella]] made a deal with the Phibians to stop this trade.  <ref>''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' pg. 225, 284-287</ref>}}

===The Seaworms===
{{XD|In ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'', ten years later, the final [[ghola]] of the [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff/XD|Tylwyth Waff]] began his experimentation with worms on the planet of Buzzell. With his [[Guild]] assistants, Waff seeded the seas of the planet with genetically altered [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]]s, that would thrive in water, hence called [[Seaworms]].

A year later when Waff checked on his changed creations, Waff found that the seaworms had grown to massive proportions and had multiplied rapidly. This caused the Phibians great problems, as the seaworms were well-able to hunt down and kill the half-man/half-fish soostone harvesting altered humans. It was unknown if the Phibians were ever able to achieve a balance with the seaworms, or if the seaworms simply took over the eco-system.}}

Rabbi
{{mixed}}

[[File:Rabbigammu.jpg|thumb]]


The '''Rabbi''' was a [[Jew]]ish teacher and leader who lived on [[Gammu]] when the [[Honored Matres]] conquered that world in their return from the [[Scattering]]. The Rabbis was a very orthodox and conservative Jewish leader, always leaning to the conservative side, when confronted with spiritual dilemmas facing human-kind.
Jews had always been persecuted since before the days of [[Old Earth]] thousands of years in the past. But in an underground alliance with the [[Bene Gesserit]], the Jews had received secret sanctuary from the Sisterhood. The Rabbi, who was never named by his first or last name, was the leader of his people, who included the Jewish Bene Gesserit [[Rebecca]], and one of the Rabbi' assistants, [[Isaac]]; on the planet formerly named [[Giedi Prime]].

The Rabbi found himself with the rest of the Jews congregated on the [[no-ship]] in which he and his congregation were kept in the vessel on [[Chapterhouse]] near the [[Chapterhouse Keep]]. When [[Sheeana Brugh]], [[Garimi]], [[Stokes]], and the other conservative Bene Gesserit sisters decided to leave the now-combined Matres/Gesserit organization, the [[New Sisterhood]], the Jews were caught up in their fervor. The group escaped with the [[ghola]]s of [[Miles Teg]] and [[Duncan Idaho]], as the latter took the no-ship off of Chapterhouse, and into the Unknown. They were stranded crew along with the imprisoned [[futar]]s, Sheeana's six [[sandworm]] that had been raised near the Keep, and the last [[Tleilaxu Master]], [[Scytale]]. As the great Outside [[Enemy]], [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]], tried to ensnare the no-ship in their [[Tachyon net]], the entire group found themselves in another universe as Idaho folded space.

When the no-ship visited the planet of the handlers, the Rabbi and the ghola of Thufir Hawat were separated from the others, trapped by the New Face Dancers, and killed. The others in the group did not discover the Face Dancers had replaced Thufir and the Rabbi for another five years, during which time they perpetrated many acts of sabotage against the no-ship. When Scytale finally unmasked the Rabbi as a Face Dancer he took control of the ship, guiding it through fold-space to the hands of the Enemy. The ghola of Alia broke into the control room and shot him with a needle gun.

'''Salusa Secundus''' was the third planet in the [[Stars#Gamma Waiping|Gamma Waiping]] star system, and the designated homeworld of [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]], though it later became a [[prison planet]] after the migration of the Royal Corrino court to the planet [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]] <ref>''Dune, Termiology of the Imperium, page 341'' </ref>.

== Environment ==
Salusa Secundus was similar to old [[Earth/XD|Earth]] in its size, relative position from its star, relative landmass, and atmosphere. It was once a beautiful green world of temperate climate, home to hundreds of millions of free humans. Water flowed through open aqueducts. Around [[Zimia]], hills were embroidered with vineyards and olive groves.

However, an atomic catastrophe devastated this beautiful planet.

A harsh place, with many wild beasts, extreme temperatures, and difficult terrain. It was noted for being one of the only two planets in the Universe where [[shigawire]] was grown.

== History & Purpose ==
Salusa Secundus was remembered in [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] tradition as being a temporary home for the [[Wandering Zensunni]]; a planet on which nine generations of the Fremen ancestors lived as slaves. However, the veracity of such a belief remains debatable.

A region was once inhabited by [[Buddislamics]] before they were freed from generations of slavery and went off to settle on [[Unallied Planets]]. [[Muadru]] pottery had also been found in its ruins, which became archeological site north of the later built city of [[Zimia]].

During the last years of the [[Old Empire]], a man named [[Bovko Manresa]] settled on then isolated Salusa Secundus and his mansion had become a meeting hall for refugee humans. During the [[Time of Titans]], the [[League of Nobles]] supposedly was formed out of these meetings. Salusa Secundus was thenceforth its capital, until and during the [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]].

The planet had successfully repelled two assaults of the [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machines]]. The [[Battle of Zimia|first]] assault occurred shortly before the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. [[Tercero]] [[Xavier Harkonnen]] assumed command of the defenses of the planet and it's capital. The attack was led by [[Agamemnon]] and other [[Titans]]. Their objective was the [[Scrambler web]] generator towers in the city. If the Titans could destroy the towers, it would allow the orbiting [[Thinking Machine]] fleet to attack the planet directly. Fortunately, Tercero Harkonnen anticipated the Cymek objective and thwarted the attack.

Salusa had become a central world for distributing refugees and repopulating planets and strengthening racial lines using seed stock gathered by the [[Sorceresses]] of Rossak years ago.

===Prison planet===
[[Atomic]] catastrophe destroyed the ecology of Salusa Secundus, and Emperor [[Hassik Corrino III]] moved the [[Imperial Throne]] to Kaitain. It is thought that the devastation of the planet came about by an attack by [[House Tantor]] against House Corrino.

[[File:Salusasecundus_citadel.jpg|thumb|Salusa Secundus citadel]]
Due to the harshness of Salusa Secundus, it became the Corrino prison planet. Those who were deemed criminals of the Corrino Empire were imprisoned on the planet. Many in the empire have suspected that the harshness of this world was responsible for breeding [[Sardaukar]] troops. This was the theory maintained by [[House Atreides/XD|Atreides]] generals, namely that the harsh environment of the planet was responsible for the development of a fierce, hardened people.

This theory was further strengthened by the discovery by the Atreides of the resilience and fighting abilities of the Fremen on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. However, prior to the time of [[Muad'Dib]], very little was truly known of Salusa's climate. The origins of the Sardaukar and the source of their numbers remained only in speculation.

=== Under Shaddam IV ===

[[File:511kCYpnQCL._AC_SL230_-1.jpg|thumb|Salusa Secundus citalel -Dune CCG]]

In [[10193 AG]], [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] wrested the Imperial Throne from House Corrino. Before taking the throne, Paul promised [[Shaddam IV/XD|Shaddam IV]] that he would keep a throne on Salusa Secundus, and that the planet would be transformed into a pleasant and beautiful world. This move was outwardly to show that he maintained respect for Shaddam, but in truth the move was to rob the deposed Emperor of the training grounds for his Sardaukar.

Shaddam IV then went into retirement, ruling over Salusa Secundus with the majority of his Household in accompaniment. From his deposed home, Shaddam witnessed the birth of his grandchild, [[Farad'n Corrino]]; sired by [[Dalak Fenring/XD|Dalak Fenring]], whose mother was [[Wensicia Corrino]]. It was also from the planet that Shaddam continually tried to encourage [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] to re-join him, so that together they could wrest the Imperium back to House Corrino.

After the aborted attempt on Paul's life on [[Arrakis]], by Hasimir's daughter, [[Marie Fenring]], who was killed by [[Alia Atreides]]; and the subsequent second attempt on his life by the Count himself; Hasimir and his wife, [[Margot Fenring/XD|Margot Fenring]], were exiled permanently to Salusa Secundus.

Twisted mentat
{{Mixed}}

[[File:Piter_Schoenherr.jpg|thumb]]


'''Twisted Mentats''' were [[Mentat]]s who originated from the planet [[Tleilax]]. They were different from normal Mentats in those characteristics nonessential to pure computational ability. These variations took the form of body structure, emotional nature, and psychological make-up, depending upon customers' orders. Mentats produced by legitimate schools were also bred with certain characteristics in mind, but these were relatively benign in comparison to the Tleilaxu machinations and not the result of genetic engineering.

Mentat training tended to capitalize upon and benefited from the individual’s natural characteristics. It was the standard practice of the legitimate Mentat schools to select admirable individuals as students. Tleilaxu Mentats were a separate breed, displaying artificially produced characteristics. That these traits were often odious said as much against the Tleilaxu as against the [[House|Great Houses]] who were Bene Tleilax supporters.

Presumably, the Bene Tleilax did not lack customers, and it is likely that there were numerous twisted Mentats during the days of the [[Imperium]]. A notable one was [[Piter de Vries]], an effeminate, psychopathic killer in the employ of [[House Harkonnen]] under Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Vladimir]].

Since the Mentats produced by the Tleilaxu were so often warped and bizarre in nature, they came universally to be regarded as objects of repugnance. However, this is probably merely a societal taboo rather than a real stigma as their skills were in demand. That they were trusted with the secrets of great houses does suggest that their psychological problems did not extend to being untrustworthy. It's certainly unlikely that someone as perceptive as Vladimir Harkonnen would confide in anyone that was likely to betray him, and definitely not in a madman.

However, in the novel ''[[Children of Dune]]'', the [[ghola]]-Mentat [[Duncan Idaho#First_Rebirth|Duncan Idaho]] suggested that the "twisting" was a "hoax" maintained by the Tleilaxu. Potentially the twisted mentats were expelled pupils from legitimate schools, forced out for not living up the schools ideals then recruited by the Tleilax and re-trained to emphasise the negative sides of their personalities. According to Idaho, the twisting was very fragile, and twisted Mentats still maintained their own selfdom and dignity, refusing to be absolutely controlled by the Great Houses that bought them.

Margot Fenring
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

Lady '''Margot Fenring''', was the [[Bene Gesserit]] wife of the [[Mentat]] Count [[Hasimir Fenring]]. Despite superficially falling under the influence of [[House Corrino]], Margot fully served the Sisterhood to many ends. After the vast reduction of Bene Gesserit influence following the [[Ascension of House Atreides]], Margot and her husband dedicated themselves to serving their own ends.

==Marriage to Hasimir Fenring==
The Sisterhood allowed her to be married to Count Hasimir Fenring, the ruler of [[House Fenring]], a [[House Minor]] long aligned to [[House Corrino]]. While present in the [[Padishah Emperor|Padishah Emperor's]] court she persuaded [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam]] to marry [[Reverend Mother]] [[Anirul Corrino|Anirul Sadow-Tonkin]], whom the Sisterhood knew would not yield House Corrino any sons.

[[File:Margot Fenring.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Margot as depicted in the Dune Trading Card Game.]]
As the wife of Hasimir Fenring, Margot was resident on [[Arrakis]] during his temporary governorship. Prior to their departure, and the arrival of [[House Atreides]], she left an encoded message for the Lady [[Jessica Atreides]], warning her of [[House Harkonnen|House Harkonnen's]] planned treachery.

{{Quote|TO THE LADY JESSICA — May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger. My kindest wishes| MARGOT LADY FENRING}}
The visible note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a [[School Injunction]] was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it. Jessica's fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:

{{Quote|Your son and Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection. I do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that I cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H| In haste, MF.}}
Unfortunately, Margot's warning is not enough to stop the Harkonnen plot against the Atreides. Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] is killed, and Jessica and her son Paul are forced to flee into the desert of Arrakis.

==Mission with Feyd==
[[File:230px-Feyd.jpg|thumb|left|Feyd-Rautha, na-baron of House Harkonnen, in the Dune Miniseries (2000)]]
Later Margot is sent by the Bene Gesserit to seduce [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] and to preserve the bloodline by retrieving his genetic material (through conception) for their breeding program. She also intends to plant deep in his deepest self the necessary [[prana-bindu]] phrases to bend him, (a Hypno-ligation of his psyche). As she and her husband discuss what a shame it is that [[Paul Atreides]] is dead (as everyone thinks he is at that time), Margot prophetically recounts a Bene Gesserit saying: Do not count a human dead until you've seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.

Margot has shared some of her training with her husband since when the Count focused on Paul, he saw with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in the Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this Atreides youth. Hasimir subsequently refuses Emperor Shaddam IV's command that he kill Paul.

Soon after, as Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] watches Paul and Feyd-Rautha duel to the death, she comments on the existence of Margot's child by Feyd: If both died that would leave only Feyd-Rautha's bastard daughter, [[Marie Fenring]] still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured factor, and [[Alia Atreides]].

A harsh place, with many wild beasts, extreme temperatures, and difficult terrain. It was noted for being one of the only two planets in the Universe where [[shigawire]] could grow.

== History & Purpose ==
Salusa Secundus was remembered in [[Fremen]] tradition as being a temporary home for the [[Wandering Zensunni]]; a planet on which nine generations of the Fremen ancestors lived as slaves. However, the veracity of such a belief remains debatable.

===Prison planet  ===
[[File:Salusasecundus_citadel.jpg|thumb|left|Salusa Secundus citadel]]
Due to the harshness of Salusa Secundus, it became the Corrino prison planet. Those who broke imperial law and were judged guilty were sentenced to be imprisoned on the planet. Many in the empire suspected that the harshness of this world was responsible for breeding [[Sardaukar]] troops. This was a theory maintained heavily by [[House Atreides|Atreides]] generals, namely that the harsh environment of the planet was responsible for the development of a fierce, hardened people.

This theory was further strengthened by the discovery by the Atreides of the resilience and fighting abilities of the Fremen on [[Arrakis]]. However, prior to the time of [[Muad'Dib]], very little was truly known of Salusa's climate. The origins of the Sardaukar and the source of their numbers remained only in speculation.

=== Under Shaddam IV ===
In [[10193 AG]], [[Paul Atreides]] wrested the Imperial Throne from House Corrino. Before taking the throne, Paul promised [[Shaddam IV]] that he would keep a throne on Salusa Secundus, and that the planet would be transformed into a pleasant and beautiful world. This move was outwardly to show that he maintained respect for Shaddam, but in truth the move was to rob the deposed Emperor of the training grounds for his Sardaukar.

Shaddam IV then went into retirement, ruling over Salusa Secundus with the majority of his Household in accompaniment. From his deposed home, Shaddam witnessed the birth of his grandchild, [[Farad'n Corrino]]; sired by [[Dalak Fenring]], whose mother was [[Wensicia Corrino]]. It was also from the planet that Shaddam continually tried to encourage [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring]] to re-join him, so that together they could wrest the Imperium back to [[House Corrino]].

After the aborted attempt on Paul's life on [[Arrakis]] by Hasimir's daughter [[Marie Fenring]], who was killed by [[Alia Atreides]], and the subsequent second attempt on his life by the Count Hasimir himself and his wife, [[Margot Fenring]], were exiled permanently to Salusa Secundus.

Tylwyth Waff
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
'''Tylwyth Waff''' was a [[Tleilaxu Master]] or [[Mahai]], and a [[Masheikh]]. Most significantly, he is the tacit leader of the [[Ruling Council]] during the [[return of the Honored Matres]]. As such he had significant control over the direction of the [[Bene Tleilax]].[[File:Waff.jpg|thumb|Tylwyth Waff, Masheik of the Bene Tleilax.]]

== Background ==
As with most Masheikhs, Waff had lived for thousands of years, thanks to successive [[ghola]] replacements. Waff had spent an unknown number of years guiding the Tleilaxu's secretive religious agenda for power.

"Tylwyth" is a word from the Welsh Language which typically means "family", "tribe" or "ancestry", hence "Tylwyth Waff" provides a subliminal clue early on that Waff was indeed based on earlier ghola incarnations. In Welsh mythology "Tylwyth" is typically associated with "Tylwyth Teg" (tr. "the Fair Folk") a term used to describe faeries, gnomes and such like. Again probably hinting at Waff's Tleilaxu origins.

== Actions as Leader ==
After the return of the [[Honored Matres]], Waff saw his own power and the wider Tleilaxu civilization threatened with destruction. He subsequently allied himself with the [[Bene Gesserit]], thinking they were true believers of the [[Zensunni]] faith. However, his efforts were ultimately fruitless, and the Tleilaxu, including Waff, were almost entirely destroyed by the Honored Matres after the destruction of Rakis.

The '''Bene Gesserit Order''', often shortened to simply the '''Bene Gesserit''' or '''the Sisterhood''', were an ancient and adept organisation, who privately denied they were a religious order, but who, in their modern form, operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual mysticism, and whose training, whose symbolism, organization, and internal teaching methods were almost wholly religious. The Sisterhood consisted of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who used genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda of ascending the human race with the advent of their chosen one, the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], and later simply for the good and survival of humanity. Their objectives and actions formed a critical element in the evolution of humanity. 
==History==

=== Sorceresses of Rossak ===
<blockquote>''Main article: [[Sorceress|Sorceresses]]''</blockquote>Around the year [[400 BG]], the exotic, and largely toxic, environment on the jungle world of Rossak gave birth to the ancient and powerful Sorceresses of the planet after unique biology of the planet wrought havoc on the genome of early colonizers. The Sorceresses became a major factor in turning the tide of [[War of the League of Nobles and Synchronized Empire|the ongoing war]] between the [[League of Nobles]] and the [[Synchronized Worlds]], which had been going on for centuries, as Sorceresses often sacrificed themselves to destroy [[Cymek|cymeks]], "machines with human minds".

The Sorceresses formed into a hierachy under a [[Supreme Sorceress]], a title seemingly passed down the Cenva family. At some point, they began to keep detailed breeding records, starting what would eventually become the Bene Gesserit program of the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] - the "one who can be in many places at once".

===Sisterhood of Rossak===
After the [[Battle of Corrin/XD|Battle of Corrin]] in [[88 BG/XD|88 BG]], the '''Sisterhood of Rossak''', more often simply called '''the Sisterhood''' or sometimes the '''Rossak Order''', was founded by [[Raquella Berto-Anirul]], the granddaughter of [[Supreme Bashar/XD|Supreme Bashar]] [[Vorian Atreides]]. When Raquella survived the [[Rossak/XD|Rossak]] epidemic - a mutated version of the deadly [[Omnius Scourge]] - and an assassination attempt on Rossak by [[Supreme Sorceress]] [[Ticia Cenva]], her cellular chemistry was converted and the memories of countless female ancestors were awakened. 

Raquella quickly emerged as the leader of this group of the decimated Sorceress as the first [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] and the first [[Mother Superior/XD|Reverend Mother Superior]], and began their path of genetic breeding. This was generally considered to mark the beginning of the true Bene Gesserit.

=== Schism and reform ===
The Sisterhood was officially disbanded by [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Emperor]] [[Salvador Corrino]] in [[4 BG]], but multiple Sisters including Raquella, and her later successor [[Valya Harkonnen]], went to [[Wallach IX/XD|Wallach IX]] and re-established it as the '''Sisterhood of Wallach IX'''.  Meanwhile, in the first schism of the Sisters, a few other members such as Dorotea became members of the first '''Orthodox Sisterhood''' (supported by the Corrinos) on Salusa Secundus.   

Raquella summoned Sister Dorotea and the Orthodox Sisters to the Wallach IX school and named Dorotea and Vayla co-leaders befor she dies. However, Vayla used her newly discovered power of [[Voice]] to force Dorotea to commit suicide, declaring herself to be the sole Mother Superior of the reunited Order, and ingratiaing herself to the Emperor, [[Roderick Corrino]].  

{{Quote|We stand at a critically important time for the Sisterhood. It was [[Mother Superior/XD | Mother Superior]] [[Raquella Berto-Anirul | Raquella]]'s dying wish that our factions be reunited, the rift healed, and I intend to lead my new Sisterhood united through a bright time of growth and strengthening. We must place more [[Truthsayer]]s and Sister-[[Mentat/XD | Mentat]]s in the noble [[House/XD | House]]s of the [[Landsraad/XD | Landsraad League]], make ourselves indespensible to the [[Corrino Empire/XD | Imperium]]. Not only will this generate revenue for us, it will also make us vital to very influential people. But that is only a stepping stone. We have [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD | much greater plans]] in store.|[[Mother Superior/XD | Mother Superior]] [[Valya Harkonnen]]'s plans for the Sisterhood|Navigators of Dune}}

The Orthodox branch was absorbed by the dominant Wallachians under Valya, and it's members began to work for them as assets in the Imperial court.  After three years as Mother Superior, Valya began to change the focus of the Sisterhood from peaceful political intrigue into a battle hardened association of assassins and political manipulators, shaping its modern form, renaming it the "'''Bene Gesserit'''", probably with some connection to the transition of the Tlulaxa into the [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Bene Tleilax]], and erecting the historic first Mother School. The sprawling complex was the base of Bene Gesserit operations throughout the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]]. 

=== Emergence as a universal power ===
For millennia, the Bene Gesserit Order chose to exercise its power by acting in the background of imperial politics. Through their breeding program, their placement of agents in the imperial court and [[Great House/XD|Great Houses]], and their provision of services such as the training of noble females, mediation in disputes, and overseers of negotiations, the Bene Gesserit carved out a significant niche in the structure of the Imperium. They were also silent partners in [[CHOAM/XD|CHOAM]] along with the Bene Tleilax. 

This all changed when [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] wrested the imperial throne from [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]]. After the reign of Paul Atreides and his son Leto Atreides II, there came into existence a power vacuum. This vacuum was filled by both the Bene Gesserit and Bene Tleilax, who sought to maintain control over the remnants of the empire after humanity exploded across the universe in The Scattering. The Bene Gesserit came to believe that if they were to avoid coming under another tyrant, they would have to take a more active role in politics and universal events.

===Honored Matres===
====Return of the Honored Matres====
It came to the point where the Bene Gesserit came to open conflict with both the Bene Tleilax and the Honored Matres, an alien bastardisation of the Bene Gesserit, blended with the [[Fish Speaker/XD|Fish Speakers]], and recovered female [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]], that returned from The Scattering. Indeed, the Sisterhood found themselves in a position of champion of the Old Order when the Honored Matres began attacking planets of the Old Imperium. During [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|the war between the two Sisterhoods]], the Gesserit Mother Superior [[Darwi Odrade]], a descendant of Paul, realized only through the Sisterhood combining with the Matres could both organizations survive into the future. First, Odrade trained her captive [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]], a captured Matre, in the ways of the sisters. Then she and a ghola of Miles Teg, set up a plan to attack the Honored Matre base on the [[Guild/XD|Guild]]-world of [[Junction/XD|Junction]]. As Odrade was killed in the ensuing battle, Murbella also killed the Honored Matre leader, [[Logno]], and then decided to unite both groups into the [[New Sisterhood]].

====Sheeana escapes====
There was immediate resistance to the concept of the merger, as [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]], a rebel Reverend Mother, escaped from [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]] in a [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]], with a hundred of her fellow sisters; taking a few [[sandworm/XD|sandworms]] with them. They escaped with Miles Teg and Duncan Idaho, who had their own reasons for leaving; but Sheeana's group's intention was one to set up a "pure" Gesserit outpost, far away from civilization. As the no-ship fold-spaced throughout the cosmos in an attempt to escape the [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]] of the mysterious elderly couple, [[Daniel/XD|Daniel]] and [[Marty/XD|Marty]], the sisters aboard the no-ship held true to their training and structure.

====Second Bene Gesserit (Orthodox Sisterhood)====
On the no-ship, the ''[[Ithaca]]'', when needed, Sheeana and her assistants created gholas of yesteryear, as they saw fit. After 20 years, when they reached the world of [[Qelso]], they witnessed first hand the drought created by earlier terra-forming attempts of colonizing sisters, who had introduced sandworms to the planet decades earlier. 26 years after the escape from Chapterhouse, the ''Ithaca'' was finally captured and brought to [[Synchrony]], by the minions of Daniel and Marty, now revealed to be than the reborn leaders of the [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] Empire, [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]]. Sheeana helped the ghola of Leto II release the ''Ithaca's'' sandworms into the soil of Synchrony, starting a spice cycle on that planet. Later, the Ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, now revealed to be Duncan Idaho, allowed the Bene Gesserit sisters to found a colony on the planet, and for their acolytes to be trained in the traditional way.

==Objectives ==
The primary objective of the Bene Gesserit was to attain further power and influence and help to direct humanity along a path of insight and stability. Up until the emergence of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], the anticipated means of reaching this goal was through the [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]] - the one who can be all places at once (a male Bene Gesserit "Mother Superior", a "super-being", and ultimately a messiah figure to serve the [[Missionaria Protectiva]], and the ultimate objective of their age-old breeding program. The triumph of their plan was supposed to occur when the daughter of [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Leto I]] bred with [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]].

However, their plans were thrown into turmoil by [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], when she consciously gave Leto Atreides I a son, [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], instead of a daughter. Paul was assumed the Kwisatz Haderach, and, much to the dismay of the Bene Gesserit, arrived a generation too soon. Whether the order could have fully controlled the Kwisatz Haderach as they hoped remains debatable.

The Bene Gesserit’s plans were further disrupted when Paul bred with [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]], the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] daughter of [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], stirring up rogue and unpredictable genetic traits. Their son, Leto Atreides II, and his actions as the [[God Emperor]], radically altered the long-term destiny of the Bene Gesserit: their primary goal became the re-establishment of their power-base, an intention that was severely tested by the emergence of the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]].

This objective was largely met, thanks to the merger of the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres but it remained clear that their fate is still very much out of their own hands.
==Credo==
{{Stub}}''Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is 'Thou shall not question!' But we question. We break that commandment as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity.''
==Basic structure==
Women unquestionably ruled the Bene Gesserit, and while men did maintain some important roles, they were always answerable to at least one woman - the Bene Gesserit Mother Superior.
====Mother Superior  ====
The Mother Superior maintained ultimate control of the entire order, and invoked almost unquestioned loyalty among the subordinate Reverend Mothers. A Reverend Mother chose her successor prior to her death, and imparted her memories and personality to her. The inheritance of the Mother Superiors, at times, diverged among multiple Reverend Mothers, usually for tactical reasons. It is fair to assume that such a scenario has not occurred in the past.

====Kwisatz Mother====
The Kwisatz Mother possessed the strongest tie to the voice in [[Other Memory]], and was in charge of the program to breed the Kwisatz Haderach; She solely directed the breeding program.

The subordinate Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit fulfilled many diverse roles, including intelligence gathering, diplomacy, and breeding to continue the objectives of the breeding program. They also pursued more menial roles, with their occupation determined by the quality of their genetic make-up.

====Reverend Mother====
Reverend Mothers have undergone the Spice Agony and survived. They fill the role of advisors, faculty, historians, geneticists. General authority of the Order for most members and the outside populace.

====Proctor Superiors====
Proctor Superiors are in charge of a chapter house, each chapter house has a Proctor Superior.

====Truthsayer====
Truthsayers were taught the ways to invoke the truth trance, and to notice even subtle changes in repsiration, eye movement, facial motions, and body language, to sense if an individual was telling a lie.

====Sister and Initiates====
Agents, concubines, potential wives.

==Powers and abilities==
===Chemical and organic powers===
The Bene Gesserit schools were designed to maximise the physical and mental potential of humanity, especially females. As a result, Bene Gesserit adepts possessed abilities that could not be rivalled by anyone else in the known universe.

Physically, a Bene Gesserit could control every muscle and nerve in their body, right down to the individual fibers. They were supreme in the disciplines of prana and bindu. The results of this training were numerous abilities, including the following:

====Oral analysis====
Upon tasting an item, a Bene Gesserit can break down the food into its ingredients, right down to its chemical composition.

====Internal organic-chemical control====
Alteration of metabolism to render poisons harmless. This ability was used when potential Reverend Mothers took the [[Water of Life]]. It was also sought by the Honored Matres, from the Sisterhood, as they sought a way to combat the revived [[Omnius Scourge]].
====Prana-bindu control====
Alteration of blood flow, body temperature, heart rate, and level of consciousness, for the purposes of survival in harsh environments, or escaping from bonds.

====Weirding Way====
Superior hand-to-hand combat abilities. Bene Gesserit trained men and women were unrivalled in their fighting abilities. Only Imperial [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] and the Fremen of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] could approach the abilities of a Bene Gesserit in regards to combat techniques, attack speed, and resourcefulness.

Later, in the Age of The Tyrant, and even later, in the times after [[Scattering/XD|The Scattering]], new abilities were developed in humans by means of genetic breeding, in extremis situations (see [[Miles Teg/XD|Miles Teg]], a Bene Gesserit Bashar), or designed into [[ghola/XD|ghola]] abilities, such as in the later gholas of [[Duncan Idaho]].

===Mental abilities===
====Consciousness altering====
Bene Gesserit mental abilities included supreme levels of discipline. A Bene Gesserit mind could alter its level of consciousness, for the sake of relaxation, and hyper-alertness in times of potential danger.

====Guilt casting====
Some Bene Gesserit sisters could use the psychic ability of [[guilt-caster|guilt-casting]], which was used as a means of disbaling one's opponent. This experiment was prominent during the end of the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino Empire]] and the [[Ascension of House Atreides]].

====Petit perception====
Sisters could monitor minutiae in others to detect concealed emotions, motivations, agendas, or even physical things such as concealed weapons, a false accent, surgery, or deception in general. This particular skill was useful in detecting [[Face Dancers]].
==Teachings==
{{Stub}}During Bene Gesserit education students were curricula consisted, among other thing, out of various maxims and precepts some of which were recorded.

==Behind the scenes==

* The name "Bene Gesserit" in Latin means "shall have behaved well". The name however can be interpreted as a Hebrew derivative. "B'nei" (בני) means 'children of' (e.g. Bene Tleilax) and "Gesher" (גשר) means 'bridge'. [[Brian Herbert]], meawnwhile, speculates that "Gesserit" is most likely a derivative of the word "Jesuit", an order of priests still active today. "Jesuit" also has the connotation of someone given to intrigue or mystique. Under this theory, the name "Bene Gesserit" can be interpreted to mean a society of religious people who are secretive or clandestine but function for the good of the society they inhabit.

Weapon, the
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Weapon.png|thumb]]

'''The Weapon''' was a [[starship]]-launched missile created by the [[Ones of Many Faces]], which once launched would create a fiery blast of immense heat, and destroy almost everything in its path.

===Destruction of Rakis===
'''The Weapon''' was used by [[Honored Matres]], who took it from the Ones of Many Faces, in their major attack against [[Rakis]], in their successful attempt to kill Supreme [[Bashar]] [[Miles Teg]]. Because Teg had killed some of the Matres’ leadership earlier in the year while on the planet [[Gammu]], Teg, the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Mother Superior]] [[Alma Mavis Taraza]] and the [[Tleilaxu Master]] Scytale knew that a retributive strike would come. With [[Sheeana]], who gathered a [[sandworm]] from the surface of [[Dune]], Taraza's assistant [[Darwi Odrade]] and Scytale fled the surface of Rakis, just before the Matres arrived. Teg stayed behind on Rakis to ensure the prior group’s escape.

When the Matres struck Dune with the heat-based devastating Weapon missiles, the atmosphere immediately caught fire, which caused half of it to evaporate. The immense fireballs scorched the surface of the planet, killing almost all life on the world, sandworms and humans alike, including Teg. Much of the sand on the covering of the planet, when exposed to the extreme heat of the resulting explosions, fused into a type of hardened glass.

No-ship
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{FeaturedArticle}}
[[Image:No-ship.jpg|thumb|right|The no-ship docked on the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Chapterhouse]] planet]]
A '''no-ship''' was a [[starship]], and type of [[no-chamber]], that was invisible to [[prescience]]. This meant that its movements or occupants could not be seen by many of those who possessed prescient powers, such as [[Guild Navigator]]s, and some [[Atreides]] descendants.

==Usage==
No-ships came into heavy use during and after the time of [[The Scattering]]. They were used by people fleeing the [[Old Imperium]] into the vast unknown of uncharted space. Since no-ships possessed [[navigation machine|advanced calculation systems]], they did not require a [[Guild Navigator]]'s [[prescience|prescient]] abilities to avoid collision with interstellar bodies. Because of this, they could escape charted territories without difficulty. However, this also meant that they came dangerously close to defying the prohibitions of the [[Butlerian Jihad]].

During the time of the [[Honored Matres]], when the [[Lost Ones]] were returning to the Old Imperium, no-ships had become commonplace. Not only were they used to hide individuals and their movements, but they were also employed as planetary defenses by being placed in orbit. In this way, although prescience was normally an almost faultless method for detecting planetary defenses, those who used prescience in an attempt to search for no-ships would find it difficult, if not impossible, to detect them.

At times, no-ships were often armed and took part in space battles.

== Prescience-Blocking Abilities ==
Like a no-chamber, anything inside a no-ship was hidden from [[prescience|prescient]] vision and other methods of detection, although when in standby mode, it was visible with the naked eye. A no-ship had much greater technological capability than a no-chamber; for example, it was able to perform the functions of a [[Guild Navigator]]. Specifically, a no-ship's computer was capable of enough limited prescience that it could successfully navigate its way through a fold in the fabric of the space-time continuum.

Evidence suggested that certain individuals with [[House Atreides|Atreides]] ancestry were capable of using their prescient powers to "see" no-ships. [[Miles Teg]], a [[Bashar]] during the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]], and a descendant of [[Ghanima Atreides]] and [[Farad'n Corrino]], was cloned by the [[Bene Gesserit]], and his clone imprinted with the ability to nullify no-field invisibility after being exposed to a device called a T-Probe, an offshoot of an [[Ixian]] device.

== Vessel Size ==
The size of No-ships could vary. Early experimental No-ships were small, but later No-ships were colossal in size. Individuals were capable of living within one for years without suffering many of the undue effects one would associate with such confinement, implying a very large and luxurious living space. Even more indicative of the great size of later no-ships, these vessels were also capable of transporting multiple adult [[sandworm]]s, with enough sand for them to grow and survive for the duration of the prolonged trip. With the return from the Scattering, models of no-ships were also designed as warships, and guardian no-ships and fortress no-ships appeared.

== Technological Ramifications ==

Holtzman
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:91607857_1024-620x350-1.jpg|thumb|Holtzman -Fanart]]

'''Holtzman''', also spelled '''Holtzmann''' or '''Holzmann''', was a famed physicist and scientist of the BG era who pioneered a branch of theory relating to the repellant force of subatomic particles. Most of the discoveries in this area of physics to bear the root were named after him, since they were based on the [[Holtzman Effect]], which provided the basis of many developments throughout [[human]] history, including:

* '''The [[Holtzman shield]]:''' the Effect allowed the creation of a shielding that repelled fast moving projectiles, but allowed slower moving objects, such as hand-held [[knives]], to pass through.
* '''[[Suspensors]]:''' the Effect's repellent effect allowed physical objects equipped with a Holtzman field generator to mitigate gravitational attraction.
* '''The Glowglobe:''' Another practical use of the Holtzman Effect was the invention of the [[glowglobe]], which produced light self-powered usually by organic batteries, and float allowed by a small Holtzman field [[suspensor]] generator.
* '''Subatomic fusion:''' an unexpected byproduct of a laser hitting a [[shield]] was the release of vast amounts of energy.
* '''[[Space travel]]:''' without question the most profound effect of the Holtzman Effect was its ability to fold space and time using the [[Holtzman engine]], and thus allow for instantaneous travel from one side of the universe to the other.
Thousands of years later, [[Duncan Idaho]] realised that the mysterious entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] had found another way to use Holtzman's ancient theories.

Landsraad
{{Or-DE,Ex}}


{{Organisation_infobox|name=Landsraad|founded=c. [[2100 BG]]|dissolved=|headquarters=[[Salusa Secundus]]|image=51hEi_KSh-L._SY445_-1.jpg}}

The '''Landsraad''' was the body that represented all the [[House|Great Houses]], founded long before the [[Butlerian Jihad]] but rising to prominence during the early days of the [[Corrino Empire]]. It was ruled by the [[High Council]] and overseen by the [[Padishah Emperor]].

The Landsraad Council met regularly, and provided a forum within which Great Houses could relate with one another, to either negotiate trade agreements, create alliances or conduct [[Kanly|kanly]], the formalised processes of vendetta, or feud. It was also supposed to protect the Great Houses from being singled-out by the Imperial House and eliminated by it.

The Landsraad Council did not come into play with the destruction of House Atreides, however, in the Original Dune due to the jealousy and envy that the other Houses had for the popularity of [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]].

[[File:Dune21.png|thumb|Landsraad Hall- Storyboard for Jodorowsky´s Dune by Moebius]]

In terms of military strength, all the Great Houses, were they to unite through the Landsraad, would supposedly have been a match for the Imperial [[Sardaukar]] forces.

Upon the ascendancy of [[House Atreides]] to the Imperial Throne, the Landsraad saw a reduction in its power, but the continuation of the Great Houses meant the body remained in place for at least several hundred years into the reign of [[Leto Atreides II]], the [[God Emperor]].

The Landsraad was governed by the '''High Council'''. It presided over issues such as the forms of Kanly, and whether certain Houses should be banished for breach of the [[Great Convention]].

Motions were passed by a vote. Great Houses maintained the "lion's share" of the vote, while the Imperial House also had a powerful vote. Minor Houses had a lesser vote. However, even the Emperor had to answer to the [[High Council]] on some issues.

Great Houses continued to exist after the death of Leto II, even during the time the [[Lost Ones]] returned from [[The Scattering]]. However, it is not known whether the Landsraad continued to exist during this time. 

== Behind the Scenes ==

The word ''Landsraad'' means literally "Land Council". The word exists in several Scandinavian languages, but is now spelled ''Landsråd''; until the spelling reform of 1948 it was still written as ''Landsraad'' in Danish. In Dutch or Afrikaans the word would also be ''Landsraad'', but Herbert did borrow the word from Scandinavian. When asked, he defined the Landsraad thus:

<blockquote>Q: In the novel Dune, what is the Landsraad?<br /> 
Herbert: Well, Landsraad is an old Scandinavian word for an assembly of landowners. It's historically accurate in that it was an assembly and the first meetings of the legislative body &mdash; an early one, yes. The Landsraad &mdash; it's the landed gentry.<ref>Vertex Interviews Frank Herbert, Interviewer: Paul Turner, October 1973, Volume 1, Issue 4</ref></blockquote>

When Mother Superior [[Darwi Odrade]] decided to make the figure of surrendering to the Honored Matres' forces, she asked Suipol to dialogue with the Honored Matres in order to pass to the [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama]]'s headquarters in Planet [[Junction]], in order to distract the whores' troops from the surprise attack of [[Miles Teg]] to the Honored Matres' stronghold at [[Gammu]]. Odrade described Suipol as a ''"dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient." ''However, after interacting with Suipol, Odrade recognized that she was more capable than anticipated and that she was ready to undertake the [[Spice agony]] become a [[Reverend Mother|Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother]]. Suipol was slain by the Honored Matres along with [[Dortujla]], the commander of the Bene Gesserit Keep at [[Buzzell]], and [[Tamalane]], one of Odrade's advisors and ancient [[Mother Commander]] of the Bene Gesserit Embassy of [[Rakis]]. Odrade felt upset at Suipol's death, lamenting the fact that the talented acolyte wasn't able to share her memories with another sister.

Logno
{{Original}}

[[File:D8425f57970073e691de3903f309f980.jpg|thumb|Logno Fanart]]

'''Logno''', was an important [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] during the events of ''Chapterhouse: Dune''. She was the chief advisor to the [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama]], and often argued with her on certain matters, due to [[Dama]]'s weird behavior and attitudes, and after having the former poisoned, she took the post of [[Great Honored Matre]].
==History==

Dama ordered Logno to investigate more about "[[Weapon, the|The Weapon]]" and see if the [[Ix]]ians could duplicate it. Logno informed Dama they were unable to do it. It was during that meeting when she realized that Dama enjoyed having sex with [[futar]]s, and also realized that this Great Honored Matre had done many things her predecessors had rejected.

During the interrogation of the Jewish woman (and wild [[Reverend Mother]]) [[Rebecca]], Logno wanted to kill her, as many of the Honored Matre's council, however, Dama, whose autocratic style always prevailed, order Logno not to do so, but ''"let the crab leave"''.

When the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]], accompanied by a delegation of the [[Bene Gesserit]] conformed by [[Tamalane]], [[Dortujla]] and [[Suipol]], arrived on [[Junction]] to offer the [[Honored Matres]] the surrender of the Sisterhood, Dama ordered to her guards and advisors to leave the place where she and Odrade would discuss certain facts of the surrender. While that happened on Junction, the Bene Gesserit [[Supreme Bashar]] [[Miles Teg]] attacked [[Gammu]] with the Sisterhood's forces. On Junction, Logno assassinated Dama with poison (as she had already planned), assumed control of the [[Honored Matres]], and immediately surrendered. This surprised [[Darwi Odrade]], but she and [[Miles Teg]] soon realized they had fallen into a trap. The Honored Matres deployed "[[Weapon, the|The Weapon]]" and turn defeat into victory, destroying a great part of the Bene Gesserit's forces.

In a desperate last gamble, [[Murbella]] landed on the planet, declared her hostility towards the [[Great Honored Matre]] in front of an Honored Matre named [[Elpek]], and was taken to Logno who, unable to help herself, attacked Murbella, who killed her and took command of the Honored Matres, who were awed by her physical prowess. In the melee Elpek killed [[Darwi Odrade|Odrade]], and thought Murbella would spare her life, but the enraged new [[Great Honored Matre]] and [[Mother Superior]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]], after seeing Odrade's dead body, killed Elpek instantly.

Elpek
'''Elpek''' was a Senior Dame and [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] of the Hormu during the events of ''Chapterhouse: Dune''.

After the [[Bene Gesserit]]'s military disaster on [[Junction]], only two hopes remained for the Sisterhood: [[Murbella]] and [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]].

Sheeana was safe on [[Chapterhouse]], but Murbella decided that, in that critical moment, decisive measures were required, so she went to [[Junction]], where [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]] was held captive, to play her last card in order to save the Bene Gesserit. When she arrived on Junction, she was received by Elpek, who is described as ''"An ancient Honored Matre...her red robe stained, some of its decorations gone and a rip down the left shoulder. She was like some dried-up lizard, still poisonous, still with a bite but running on well-used angers, most of her energy gone. Disarrayed hair like the outer skin of a fresh-dug ginger root. There was a demon in her. Murbella saw it peering from orange-flecked eyes"''.

Elpek recognized Murbella as one of the [[Roc]]s, a deadly type of [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] trainee. She tested Murbella, questioning her about her former commander, [[Hakka]]. Then, when [[Murbella]] told Elpek about her new talents as both [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] and [[Bene Gesserit]], she accepted her as a gift, and took her in presence of the new [[Great Honored Matre]], [[Logno]]. Immediately after she was taken in Logno's presence, Murbella declared her hostility towards her, and Logno attacked her, but Murbella's new skills surpassed Logno's ones, and she killed her. During the melee, [[Darwi Odrade]] tried to intervene, and Elpek broke her neck. When Murbella realized Odrade was dead, her rage turned unstoppable, as Elpek thought she had done something normal by killing Odrade, however, Elpek didn't realized that Murbella wasn't any longer just an [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]], but also a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]]. Almost instantly, Murbella kicked Elpek's larynx, and Elpek's dead body sprawled across Odrade's one.

[[Murbella]], then, became the [[Great Honored Matre]] and [[Mother Superior]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]], opening the way for the [[New Sisterhood]] she would form, according to Odrade's plans.

On [[Junction]], Honored Matre [[Elpek]] recognized Murbella as one of the Rocs.

Since the Honored Matres were experts at sexually enslaving men, and kept more than one male as servants, as this realization became known, the term spread quickly throughout the Sisterhood. Also, most Honored Matres dressed in provocatively tight [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leotard leotards], with gaudy and eye-catching jewelry and clothes, which seemed to fit the stereotype of a prostitute.

'''Guild Navigator Tanks''' or '''Navigator Tanks''' as they were simply known were both used and constructed by the [[Spacing Guild]] for the main uses of containing and protecting their [[Guild Navigator]]s. Also it allowed and activated the Navigators prescience ability to navigate the complex structure of [[foldspace]].

== System Mechanics ==
Guild Navigator tanks were large, anti-gravitational tanks of [[Melange]] spice gas, in which a Navigator would be placed in at the beginning of their training as elite Guildsman. Their bodies would be [[Suspensor|suspended]] in mid-air, and a constant cloud-like flow of the gas would permeate the tank, being released in vents after use. A small speaker-like outlet, placed on the tank, usually at the side, allowed the Navigator to communicate to the outside (especially after their mutation did not allow them to use primary Human speech). Ordinarily, these tanks, and their respective Navigators, were guarded by a contingent of Guild servants.

'''Bashar''' was a [[Military ranks|military rank]] of the [[Old Empire]], perhaps above the [[Burseg/XD|Burseg]] and below the [[Supreme Bashar]]. It existed at least from the time of the [[Battle of Corrin]].

It was restored after the [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]] onwards for the [[Army of Humanity]]. For the [[League of Nobles]] the rank was equivalent to the [[Earth|Old Earth]] rank of ''General'' and it had four "levels".

For the [[Sardaukar/XD|Sardaukar]] the rank was comparable to the Old Earth rank of ''Colonel''.

The rank of Bashar is not to be confused with [[Supreme Bashar]], the most powerful military rank used by the League of Nobles during the Butlerian Jihad, as well as the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] during the time of the [[Honored Matres]].

Uliet/XD

[[File:Uliet.png|thumb|Uliet , Dune House Atreides #4, by Dev Pramanik  and  Alex Guimarães]]



'''Uliet''' ("Older Liet") [d. [[10153 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] who was an accomplished worm rider and one of the greatest fighters in [[Red Wall Sietch]], proven many times in battle against the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]]. 

When the [[Council of Elders]] decided to have [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] sacrificed, [[naib]] [[Heinar]] gave him a [[crysknife]] poisoned with the [[Water of Life]].

He approached his victim accompanied by two [[watermen]] who would collect his blood and water after his death. As Kynes was explaining his vision to the Fremen he approached Kynes, who, oblivious to his fate, told him "Remove yourself". Uliet realising Kynes' visions, did not wish to be remembered as a destroyer of dreams.

Kynes' sermon affected Uliet's mind, and started to believe that he is a messenger from God, but he knew that he could not abandon his mission; the blessed crysknife should not be scathed back before tasting blood. So he fell on it. Uliet took his own life instead of Kynes', and the watermen took his body instead to the [[deathstill]]. Seeing this event, the Fremen who listened to Kynes called him ''[[Umma]]''.

The shade of Uliet was advanced to the [[sadus]], the throne of heavenly judges.

Padishah Emperor
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:51--AdUYOkL-1.jpg|thumb|Padishah-Emperor as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

The '''Padishah Emperor''' was the title of the hereditary rulers of the [[Corrino Empire]], and later the [[Atreides Empire]], and thus the [[Known Universe]], coming from the ancient Persian meaning "Master King". They were also known as ''"Emperors of the Known Universe"''.

The title of Padishah Emperor was taken by the head of [[House Corrino]] after the [[Battle of Corrin]]. It was used by the head of that House for more than 10,000 years.

The defeat of House Corrino and [[House Harkonnen]] at the hands of [[House Atreides]] and the [[Fremen]] saw Paul Atreides, as the ruler of House Atreides, become the new Emperor in [[10193 AG]]. Theoretically, when the Atreides wrested the Imperial Seat from the Corrinos, both [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)]] and [[Leto Atreides II]] inherited the title of "Padishah Emperor". However, it would appear that neither of them actually used it.

Upon Alia's death and Leto's ascension, the title of ''Emperor'' took on a different meaning. Leto's formidable prescient abilities and slow transformation into a human-[[Sandworm]] hybrid saw him acquire the title [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]]. After his death, some three and a half thousand standard years later, the title of ''Emperor'' became at most a token title, due to the political turmoil that came with [[the Scattering]].

The title ceased to exist after the death of Leto II, when the Imperium was dissolved.

==Characteristics==
Giedi Prime had a day length of approximately 31.27 standard hours and a local year lasting 2.6 standard years. The planet was of average temperatures and maintained a low level of photosynthesis. This low level of photosynthesis was largely due to the heavy industrialisation of the planet under the Harkonnens. However, the Harkonnens did maintain some of the planet's original forests, mainly of [[pilingitam]] trees for logging and export.

During the time of the Padishah empire, the planet sported factories, arenas, and many cities. The arenas were used to hold spectacles for the populace, including gladiatorial events. During the rule of the Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], his nephew [[Feyd-Rautha]] would often perform in these arenas as a means of gaining popularity among the civilian population as well as the [[House Minor|Houses Minor]]. The main climate was harsh, industrial volcanic wasteland.

==History==
The planet became the homeworld of the [[House Harkonnen]] for many generations following that house's return from exile. After the fall of the Harkonnens and the rise of the House Atreides, administration of the planet was taken over by people of [[Caladan]]. During this time it was renamed Gammu by [[House Atreides|Atreides]] [[Warmaster]] [[Gurney Halleck]], although this name did not remain for long before it became known as Giedi Prime again. It was a historical irony that Halleck would come to have total power over Giedi Prime, as many years prior, he and his sister were slaves to the Harkonnens when they ruled there.

The Bene Gesserit had an investment there, which they had to write off as a total loss, and offset the cost by fees charged for services relating to the [[Star Jewel Project]]. As part of Caladanian (later Danian) administration of Giedi Prime (Gammu), most of the machines of industry were dismantled, and the planet's natural ecosystem was regenerated by large-scale replanting that lasted over thousands of years. Despite this however, some five thousand years after Harkonnen rule had ended, oily residue could still be found in the planet's soil.

Eventually, much of Gammu came under the control of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood. It became the base from which they grew [[Duncan Idaho|Duncan Idahos]] for their breeding programs. However, many parts of Gammu's cities were also under the control of Houses Minor and organisations returning from the [[Scattering]], organisations that had managed to amass significant wealth. Indeed, Gammu appeared to become a popular destination of people returning from The Scattering, and upon their return they brought with them many new and strange customs that found a home there.

== People ==
The Harkonnen military forces were conscripted from the general populace of Giedi Prime. These forces were fairly effective because many of them had managed to channel their oppressed upbringing into military endeavours. Indeed, much of the planet's population lived a meagre and oppressed existence due to the harsh rule of the Harkonnens. Many natives of Giedi Prime were used as slave labour to work the machines of heavy industry that occupied so much of the planet's surface.

'''Siridar-Baron Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen''' (born '''Feyd-Rautha Rabban'''; October [[10174 AG]] - December [[10193 AG]]) was the last [[Baron]] of [[House Harkonnen]], although he held the title only briefly towards the end of the [[Desert War]] after the death of his uncle, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], in whose plans to gain power Feyd had figured heavily, before being killed in a [[Duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen|duel]] by [[Paul Atreides]] shortly after the [[Battle of Arrakeen]]. While still alive, the Baron favored the intelligent and charismatic Feyd-Rautha over Feyd's older and dimmer brother [[Glossu Rabban|Glossu "Beast" Rabban]], [[Count]] of [[Lankiveil]], and so chose him as his heir.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Born '''Feyd-Rautha Rabban''' on [[Lankiveil]] as the son of [[Abulurd Rabban]] and his wife [[Emmi]], Feyd was his father's hope for a son who would not have to inherit the dishonour of the name of Harkonnen, and a worthy heir, instead of his older, more brutal son, Glossu.

Feyd was named in honour after his maternal grandfather, [[Rautha Rabban]], who had been killed at Glossu's orders. When the Baron heard of this he decided to take Feyd from his father to raise him on [[Giedi Prime]] as a possible heir of his own. This was when his surname was changed to [[Harkonnen]]. Over time, the Baron came to favour Feyd more than his older brother.

===Role in the Breeding Program===
Feyd, like [[Paul Atreides]], was also the product of a centuries-long breeding program organized by the [[Bene Gesserit]]; who planned their own marital alliance, joining a Harkonnen son to an Atreides daughter, uniting the powerful houses, ending their feud, and assuring their offspring would have a high probability of becoming the [[Kwisatz Haderach]].

For this reason, [[Jessica Atreides]]' decision to defy the sisterhood and to produce an Atreides son, Paul, established an irreconcilable tension between Feyd and Paul as the scions of their bitterly opposed noble houses. The risk of one or both of these young men being killed, destroying thousands of years of genetic engineering, was so great that the Bene Gesserit sent an envoy, [[Margot Fenring]] to seduce Feyd and conceive a child, salvaging his genetic material. During the seduction, she used a form of hypnotic suggestion (''Voice'') to make Feyd vulnerable to a command which, upon a specific word (most commonly 'Uroshnor') would cause complete muscle paralysis, a technique sometimes used on individuals who were considered highly dangerous.

=== Role in House Harkonnen ===
The Baron planned a strategic marital alliance, hoping to marry Feyd to Princess [[Irulan Corrino]], the eldest daughter of the Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], and giving the Harkonnens influence or control over the throne. To promote Feyd's power, he was to be installed as ruler of [[Arrakis]] after a period of tyrannical misrule by Glossu Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people.

Feyd's ambition and impatience to inherit the Baron's title and power allowed him to be manipulated by [[Thufir Hawat]], a counselor to the [[Atreides]] who was captured by the Baron. Both the Baron and Feyd were nearly assassinated as a result of Hawat's machinations.

=== Death ===
Feyd was famed for his prowess in single combat, and his willingness to break the formal rules of ''[[kanly]]'' that governed this type of challenge, by using a hidden poison spur in his fighting outfit. He nearly succeeded in killing Paul in ritualized single combat, while Paul was deciding whether to try the paralysis command and owe the Bene Gesserit his victory or whether to risk his life against Feyd in a "fair" fight.

Desert mouse
{{Original}}

{{disambigLink|the desert mouse also known as Muad'Dib|Muad'Dib}}

The '''Desert mouse''', also known as ''Muad'Dib'', is an adapted [[kangaroo mouse]] found on and adapted to the planet [[Arrakis]].

It is associated in [[Fremen]] earth-spirit mythology with a design visible on the planet's second moon, and is admired by Fremen for its ability to survive in the open desert.

The desert mouse's native Fremen name was chosen by [[Paul Atreides]] upon his acceptance into [[Sietch Tabr]].

Spice Melange
{{Or-DE,Ex}}{{Quote|'''melange''' ('''me-lange''' also '''ma,lanj''') n-s, original uncertain (thought to derive from ancient [[Earth | Terran]] Franzh): a. mixture of spices; b. spice of [[Arrakis]] (Dune) with geriatric properties first noted by [[Yanshuph Ashkoko]], royal chemist in reign of [[Shakkad the Wise]]; [[Arrakeen]] melange, found only in deepest desert sands of Arrakis, linked to prophetic visions of [[Paul Atreides | Paul Muad'Dib (Atreides)]], first [[Fremen]] [[Mahdi]]; also employed by [[Spacing Guild]] [[Guild Navigator | Navigators]] and the [[Bene Gesserit]].| ''[[Dictionary Royal]]'', fifth edition|Children of Dune}}[[File:230px-Melange_Snooper-Dune1984.png|thumb|Spice cylinders as depicted in the 1984 Dune Movie]]The '''Spice Melange''', commonly referred to simply as ''''the spice'''', was a naturally produced [[awareness spectrum narcotic]] that formed a fundamental block of commerce and technological development in the [[known universe]] for millennia. It also played an important role in travel and cultural development as it is vital for space travel by enabling [[Guild Navigator|Navigators]] to safely guide [[Starship|space ships]] through [[fold space]].

Since its discovery, several thousand years prior to the ascent of [[House Atreides]], it was produced exclusively on the planet [[Arrakis]]. This was because the conditions on Arrakis by which melange was created were unique to that planet. However, some 1500 years after the death of the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto II]], the [[Bene Tleilax]] had managed to successfully replicate it.

==Origins==
The spice originated on the planet [[Arrakis]], where it was produced deep beneath the sands. It was created in a process whereby the fungal excretions of [[sandtrout]] would mix with water to form a [[pre-spice mass]]. This mass would then be brought to the surface of the desert through an explosion of pressure, and under the intense heat and air of Arrakis, melange would form. When the worms died, sandtrout would be released into the sand, and the cycle of creation would repeat.

==Later Importance==
By the time [[House Atreides]] arrived on Arrakis, melange had become the single resource that was capable of creating or destroying an empire. Consequently, Arrakis had gone from being a distant, poor, and unimportant desert world to a greatly prized fief, and management of the [[spice mining]] operations were considered a prestigious but difficult task. Spice collection was hindered both by the aggressive and territorial [[sandworms]], and by the guerrilla tactics employed by the [[Fremen]], who resented the presence of off-worlders (especially [[Imperium|Imperial]] agents) who harvested the spice for themselves.

During the time of the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], spice production lessened significantly due to [[terraforming]] efforts on Arrakis, and also due to Leto II's desire to control who within his empire could consume spice, and how much was consumed. However, by this time significant stockpiles of spice had been collected and hidden by Leto II. These later prove valuable for a variety of reasons.

==Characteristics==
Spice is the basis for many of the things found in Fremen daily life - it can be processed to create things such as [[spice paper]], [[spice fibre]] or [[Spice explosive|chemical explosives]]. It could also be refined to create spice essence or spice gas. Its actual appearance is only alluded to a handful of times throughout the saga:

In ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' it is stated that [[Guild Navigator]] [[Edric]] "swam in a container of orange gas ... His tank's vents emitted a pale orange cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange"<ref name="DM">''[[Dune Messiah]]''</ref>, and in ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' [[Moneo Atreides|Moneo]] notes, "Great bins of melange lay all around in a gigantic room cut from native rock and illuminated by [[Glowglobe|glowglobes]] of an ancient design with arabesques of metal scrollwork upon them. The spice had glowed radiant blue in the dim silver light. And the smell - bitter cinnamon, unmistakable."<ref name="GEoD">''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''</ref> Throughout the ''Dune Chronicles'', it is said that melange possesses the odor of cinnamon.<ref name="Dune">''[[Dune (Novel)]]''</ref>

In ''Dune'', [[Lady Jessica]] notes that her first taste of spice "tasted like cinnamon." <ref name="Dune" /> [[Wellington Yueh|Dr. Yueh]] adds that the flavour is "never twice the same .. It's like life - it presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavour reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavour as pleasurable -; slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized,"<ref name="Dune" />

==Value==
[[File:Dune-CCG-•-Eye-of-the-Storm-•-1.jpg|thumb]]

During the days of the [[Corrino Empire]], the spice was the rarest and most valuable commodity in the [[known universe]]. It was said that it was so valuable that one briefcase full of spice would be enough to purchase an entire planet.

[[Great Houses]] of the [[Imperium]] were often considered rich and influential if their ruling members could afford to consume melange regularly, or, worse still, stockpile it. However, stockpiling melange was generally considered to be a very risky and dangerous endeavour, since the Emperor, the [[Bene Gesserit]], the [[Bene Tleilax]], the [[Spacing Guild]], and rival Great Houses could potentially regard such stockpiles as a threat to their position within the Imperium, as well as a threat to their supply.

Effects on those who consume melange are outlined below:

*'''Mind altering:''' it could awaken dormant parts of the human mind and encourage expanded sensory perceptions. In some humans (notably the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Guild Navigator]]s, and some members of the [[Atreides]] bloodline), heavy doses led to powerful abilities that include [[prescience]];
*'''Health benefits:''' taken regularly, it increased life expectancy and fortified overall health levels (in many cases life expectancy was tripled);
*'''Addictiveness:''' the spice had narcotic properties, thus increasing demand and creating a large and hungry market for it. An individual's addiction to the spice would worsen the more they consumed it.
*'''Physical effects:''' sustained use of the spice led to human eyes being discolored so that the entire eye would be stained blue - so called ''[[Eyes of Ibad]]''. Extensive exposure to the spice created a huge physical dependency that could radically alter the entire body (see [[Guild Navigator|Guild Navigators]]).

During The [[Butlerian Jihad]], all "[[thinking machines]]" were hunted down and destroyed, with a commandment against their ever being used again, "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind".  Instead, human Guild Navigators and their spice-warped abilities, serve the function normally performed by a navigational computer.  Hence, interstellar travel relies on spice.

===Groups critically dependent on the Spice===

*[[Bene Gesserit]]
*[[Spacing Guild]]
*[[Fremen]]

==Alternatives to Spice Melange==
Due to the monopoly of the spice, finding a viable alternative gradually became the focus of certain groups - most notably the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]]. Control of the spice during the [[Corrino Empire]] was later eclipsed in scope by the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]]. This led to protracted attempts to synthesize the spice, which eventually yielded positive results for the [[Bene Tleilax]], some 1500 years after Leto II's death. As a result, the Tleilaxu became spice merchants and funded many of their endeavours through sales revenue.

==Behind the Scenes==
Frank Herbert does not elaborate on how it was discovered in his original novels, [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] describe the event in the novel ''The Machine Crusade''.

In ''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]],'' one of the ‘quotes’ before a chapter is an extract from a dictionary. It begins:

melange (me’-lange ''also ma,lanj) n-s, origin uncertain (thought to derive from ancient Terran Franzh)''

Indeed, “mélange” is a French word meaning “mix” (as in “un mélange d'épices” meaning “a mix of spices / spice mix”). This raises the possibility some of the French language is still known in the Dune universe (whether as a known dead language or an active one spoken by very few people), and the prefix “[[Terran]]” may indicate that there are or were different dialects or patois of off-world French. Interestingly “Franzh” is the Breton word for “French”. This may be due to a later merging of French and Breton, or perhaps the mongrel nature of Galach incorporated Breton into it. Another possibility is that by the time of ''Children of Dune'', history has been distorted to the point where people no longer realise that there are multiple regional languages in France (as also is the case with many people today).<br />

Guild Navigator
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
A '''Guild Navigator''' was a senior rank of artificially super-evolved humans within the [[Spacing Guild]] and for many Guildsmen the pinnacle of their ambitions. Mutated through the consumption of and exposure to massive amounts of the spice [[Melange]], Navigators are able to use a mentally conditioned and trained form of prescience to safely navigate interstellar and galactic space in long-range starships called [[Heighliner]]s.

==Physical Description==
To enable their prescience, Guild Navigators not only consume large quantities of the spice, but are also continuously immersed in highly-concentrated amounts of orange spice gas housed in [[Navigator Tank|large tanks]]. Also, they were notorious for participating in massive spice orgies. This level of extreme and extended exposure causes their bodies to atrophy and mutate over time, their heads and extremities elongating. The first external sign of melange-induced metabolic change is visible in the eyes, as the drug tints the sclera and iris to a dark shade of blue. The shade of blue is known to be called "blue-in-blue" or "the [[Eyes of Ibad]]," "a total blue so dark as to be almost black." This is a common side effect in all spice addicts.

===Literary Canon===
In the original 1965 novel [[Dune (novel)|Dune]], Duke [[Leto Atreides]] notes that the Guild is "as jealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly," and that not even their own agents ever see Navigators. Leto's son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] wonders if they are mutated to the point of no longer appearing human. A Navigator is fully revealed in the first chapter of [[Dune Messiah]] (1969). Here, the Guild Navigator [[Edric]] is called a "humanoid fish," and described in his tank of spice gas as "an elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membranous hands — a fish in a strange sea." The Navigators' "elongated and repositioned limbs and organs" are noted in [[Heretics of Dune]].

In 1985's [[Chapterhouse: Dune]], [[Lucilla]] notes that "Navigators were forever bathed in the orange gas of melange; their features often fogged by the vapors," that they possess a "tiny v of a mouth" and "ugly flap of nose" and that "Mouth and nose appeared small on a Navigator's gigantic face with its pulsing temples." She also notes that their mutated voices require translation devices, describing "the singsong ululations of the Navigator's voice with its simultaneous mechtranslation into impersonal Galach."

In an unused passage from Dune Messiah published in [[The Road to Dune]] (2005), Edric is described as surviving without spice gas once a hole is opened in his tank, though his prescient abilities are practically useless in this state.

=== Film Canon ===
In David Lynch's 1984 film Dune, the Navigator's mutation affects his entire body, with 3rd stage navigators resembling either a giant whale or slug with a heavily deformed head. He also has a V-shaped mouth and vestigial limbs [[Suspensors|suspended]] in huge tanks of orange spice-gas. He is not shown to have the blue-in-blue eyes of a spice addict, however. The movie also states that it is the Navigator itself that folds space, and not the Heighliner's engines. [[Frank Herbert]] reportedly liked the idea of different stages of navigators as mentioned in the 1984 film and incorporated it into his later books.

In the 2000 miniseries adaptation and the subsequent ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune miniseries]]'', the appearance of the Navigators mostly adheres to the description in ''[[Dune Messiah]]'', resembling a semi-humanoid manta ray. Additionally, the guild agents are portrayed as bald men in flowing robes with peaked caps. They're often seen with their arms crossed or with their hands pressed together, strongly implying that they are in the process of becoming Navigators themselves.

In the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film]], Guild representatives appear humanoid, but their physical features are obscured by ornate white robes and an opaque spherical helmet, with a semi-reflective orange face. These, however, are unlikely to be Navigators, as [[Thufir Hawat]] includes three Navigators in his calculations of cost of the trip, while there are more than three of these representatives present.

== Role in the Spacing Guild ==
Guild Navigators were responsible for guiding space-faring ships ([[Spacefolder|spacefolders]]) through the mine-field of gravitational obstacles that lay between a source and a planetary or spatial target. They accomplished this feat by using prescient abilities brought on by excessive exposure to the [[Spice Melange]]. The navigators would either inhale massive amounts of orange spice gas or swallow spice pills, which would afford them the ability to see across vast distances of space, and importantly, into the near future, though spacefolding travel allowed through the application of the [[Holtzman Effect]] resulted in the loss of a ship roughly one in every ten journeys. A Navigator's keen senses would be able to plot safe courses for ships across vast distances of space by presciently determining unsafe routes, before a fold actually takes place, via [[prescience]].

Guild Navigators effectively replace Navigational computers used in the days of old. During The [[Butlerian Jihad]], all "[[thinking machines]]" were gathered and destroyed, with a commandment against their usage, "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind".  Instead humanity now relies on Navigators and their prescient abilities to determine safe routes throughout the cosmos. 

== Prescient abilities ==
Because of their limited prescient abilities, Guild navigators were capable of seeing minor aspects of [[Paul Atreides]]' grand designs. Guild Navigators perceived Paul as a threat to their power and indeed the stability of the universe as a whole. This was represented in their frenetic level of activity, panic buying of spice, and rock-bottom Guild Heighliner 1-way troop transit rates to Arrakis.

A Guild Navigator participated in a conspiracy to assassinate Paul some twelve years after he became Emperor. The Navigator was primarily used to shield the conspiracy from Paul and those others who had prescient abilities.

=== [[Edric]] ===
A prominent character In 1969's ''Dune Messiah''; '''Edric''' takes part in a plot against the emperor, [[Paul Atreides]], the other conspirators being the [[Bene Gesserit]] Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]], and Paul's embittered wife, [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan]] of [[House Corrino]]. Edric's involvement is solely to protect the conspirators from discovery by Paul's prescient sight, as the presence of a prescient such as Edric hides the activities of that person and those around him from other prescients. After the plot fails, Edric and Mohiam are executed in 10,207 A.G. by [[Fremen|Fremen Naib]] [[Stilgar]] on orders from Paul's sister [[Alia Atreides]].

In ''Chapterhouse Dune'' (1985), a "very powerful" Navigator is described as "one of the Edrics," suggesting a possible breeding plan or use of a series of [[ghola]] based Edric clones.

In Lynch's 1984 movie, Edric (who is a 3rd stage Navigator) visits Emperor Shaddam IV at the beginning of the movie and asks for information about the plot against House Atreides which Shaddam reveals. After hearing the plot, Edric adds a detail: Paul Atreides must be killed at all costs. Edric leaves, leaving Shaddam IV wondering why the Guild Navigator wants the Duke's son killed. This is overheard by Reverend Mother Mohiam who subsequently goes to Caladan.

==Trivia==
*The Guild Navigators have been the inspiration for several creatures and characters in science fiction. Examples include the Navigators from ''Warhammer 40,000'', the Advisors from ''Half-Life 2'', the Aurora Unit from ''Metroid Prime 3: Corruption'', and quite possibly Melfina from ''Outlaw Star''. Further examples might also include the Cylon hybrids who serve as navigators and central computers in the ''Re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series'' and the Tardigrade in ''Star Trek: Discovery .''

Coriolis storm
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-02-12-45-30-1.png|thumb|Coriolis Storm -Dune RPG illustration]]

A '''coriolis storm''' was any major sandstorm on [[Arrakis]] where the winds across the open deserts were amplified by the planet's own revolutionary motion. This caused them to reach speeds of up to 700 kilometers per hour.

The storms represent one of the principal dangers to settlements on Arrakis. The [[Fremen]] guard against them by building [[sietch]]es deep into the rock. [[Arrakeen]] is protected by a natural formation of sheer rock called the [[Shield Wall]].

Coriolis storms are a common reference or feature throughout the setting. In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', coriolis storms enter the story twice. The first storm is used by [[Paul Atreides]] to escape from [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] [[Ornithopter]]s, the second overloads the [[shield]]s of forces and ships stationed on Arrakeen during Paul's attack on the visiting [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], following the destruction of the Shield Wall.

Considering that all cyclones, hurricanes, etc. on Earth are caused by the [[wikipedia:Coriolis effect|Coriolis effect]], it can be accepted that the idea of "Coriolis storm" was created by Frank Herbert as a generic term to describe all tornado-like phenomena on Arrakis; amplified in violence by the presence of airborne sand.

'''Tleilax''' (also known as '''Tleilaxa''') is the sole planet in the [[Thalim]] star system, and was home to the [[Bene Tleilax]] - a society of [[Genetics|genetically altered]] highly religious and xenophobic humans.

Millennia later, the planet was called Tleilax and was known primarily for two things; Tleilax was the location of a renegade training center for [[Mentat]]s, and was noted as the source of [[Twisted mentat]]s. Tleilax was also the home of the [[Tleilaxu]], a race of humans composed of genetic scientists and [[Face Dancers]].

== Environment ==

Environmentally '''Tleilax''' was a beautiful [[Earth]]-like world, with a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere. It contained many areas of manicured terrain and vegetation.

It was home to several conurbations, chiefly the [[Tleilaxu]] holy city of [[Bandalong]], which was reserved exclusively for [[Tleilaxu]] natives. Scattered in and around the urban areas were large light industrial facilities which were used for the production of biological components and lifeforms, including [[Face Dancers]] and [[Ghola]]s.

Sandstorm
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-02-12-45-30-1.png|thumb|Coriolis Storm -Dune RPG illustration]]

A '''sandstorm''' is a meteorological feature of the planet [[Arrakis]]. Sandstorms were violent, consisting of electrically charged wind, sand and dust, flying at speeds of up to 500km/h.

Anyone cought in a sandstorm was almost guarranteed to die. The speeds at which the sand and dust were thrown would typically rip flesh from bone.

The [[Fremen]] of Arrakis typically did not traverse the desert when a sandstorm was approaching. However, they did possess some technology which could help them survive, if they found themselves in such a situation. This included [[stilltent|stiltents]], and the [[fremkit]].

When [[Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], were fleeing from the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] attack on Arrakis, Paul flew their [[ornithopter]] into a particularly vicious sandstorm, betting that the Harkonnen troops would not pursure them under the assumption that the Atreides faced certain death. However, due to Paul's piloting, the stilsuit and fremkit, Paul and Jessica managed to survive the sandstorm.

As Arrakis was in the process of being terraformed into a green and lush world, sandstorms became less frequent, and eventually disappeared.

After the death of the [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], people within the Imperium suffered [[Famine Times|famine]]. This in turn led to The Scattering, where countless individuals left the Imperium for uncharted space.

When the Lost Ones returned to the Old Imperium, they brought new technology, customs, languages, food, and political values.

Among the Lost Ones returning were the [[Honored Matres]], the [[Tleilaxu]] and their [[Face Dancers]], variants of the [[Suk School|Suk Doctor]], and many others.

*"Friends" - possibly descendants of Reverend Mothers or trained by them. Presumably a sub-class or servants of the Matres.
*[[Honored Matres]]
*"Inquisitors" - descendants of a type of human imported to [[Giedi Prime]] by [[House Harkonnen]]: not moved by agony, single-purpose to create pain without the slightest change of expression.

'''Naib Stilgar''' was a [[Fremen]] who was the [[Naib]] of [[Sietch]] [[Sietch Tabr|Tabr]] and the Governor of [[Arrakis]] from [[10196 AG]] onwards. He was a close friend and chief advisor to [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides|Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life {{C|?-10191}} ===
Stilgar was born at some point in time on Arrakis, and became Naib of Sietch Tabr after calling the previous Naib out. He had two wives, one of whom was [[Tharthar]].

=== Desert War {{C|10191-10193}} ===

==== Change of fief ====
Upon the change of the Arrakis fief in [[10191 AG]] from [[House Harkonnen]] to [[House Atreides]], Stilgar was befriended by Atreides [[Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]], who had been sent in advance by [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] to gauge and study the Fremen. In Idaho's reports to Leto, Idaho had judged Stilgar to be a 'good example' of the Fremen of Arrakis. Indeed, through Idaho's relationship with Stilgar and his tribe, he became so impressed with the Fremen and their ways that Idaho accepted dual loyalties to the Atreides and to Stilgar.

==== Open war ====
After House Harkonnen [[Siege of Arrakeen|attacked]] Arrakis and House Atreides went renegade, beginning the [[Desert War]], the remaining members of the Atreides family, namely the Ducal heir [[Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], sought refuge with Stilgar and his tribe, who spared them after trying to take their water and being bested. Stilgar soon became a good friend of Paul's. However, over time, as Paul developed his [[prescience|prescient]] powers, Stilgar became more of a religious follower. As the War reached it's climax, Stilgar fought during the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]].  

=== Later life {{C|10193-10219}} ===
Paul became Emperor in [[10196 AG]] and Stilgar was granted the stewardship of Arrakis later that same year, also becoming a commander in [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's loose Jihad]]. In [[10208 AG]], at the end of Paul's Jihad, Stilgar helped him settle the [[Tupile Treaty]] and the matter of the [[Ixian Confederacy]]. In [[10210 AG|10207 AG]], when Paul walked into the desert, blind, Stilgar executed the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Korba|Korba the Panegyrist]] and the Guild [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], disobeying Paul's prior orders against this.  

In [[10219 AG]], later in the regency of Alia, who had become possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Stilgar declared Sietch Tabr neutral in the war between the allies of the Lady Jessica and her grandchildren and Alia. However, he killed the Duncan Idaho ghola (Hayt) who was Alia's husband, after Duncan killed [[Javid]], violating sanctuary, and so was forced to turn against the Regent. After this, he was instrumental in allying the Fremen tribes with the allies of Jessica. Upon the ascension of [[Leto Atreides II]] not long after, Stilgar thought of a time earlier in the year when he thought of slaying Leto while he was sleeping, and privately noted that it was now 'too late'.   

=== Legacy ===
Stilgar lived a long and prestigious life, thanks in no small part to his diet of [[Spice Melange|spice melange]], a pervasive ingredient in all Fremen food and drink. Stilgar's descendants flourished well into the reign of [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], and probably beyond. He wrote a preface for the book ''"Muad'Dib, The Man"'' for the Princess [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]]. Long after his death, his seed cells were among those stored in the nullentropy tubes of the Tleilaxu Masters. 

== Appearance ==

Stilgar was a thin man, with darkly veined hands a thin nose and a full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard.

Pre-spice mass
{{Original}}

[[File:51N4D7i50YL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb]]

A '''pre-spice mass''' was a wild organic growth which arose deep under the surface of the desert on [[Arrakis]]. The culture was fungusoid in nature, and occurred when water mixed with the excretions of a [[little maker]], a young [[sandworm]].

The combination eventually created considerable pressure, which forced it to the surface of the planet as a [[spice blow]]. Its material was then transformed into [[spice melange]] by exposure to the sun and the air.

'''Piter de Vries''' [d. [[10191 AG]]] was a [[twisted mentat|Twisted Mentat]] developed by the [[Bene Tleilax]]. He served [[House Harkonnen]] under the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]]. De Vries was an ambitious and impatient sadist whose evil rivalled that of the Baron. The only mistake in his calculations he ever made was that [[Lady Jessica]] would bear [[Duke Leto]] a daughter, not son.

Piter De Vries was a tall, slender man with effeminate features. He had inky blue-within-blue eyes, red lips due to consumption of [[sapho|sapho juice]], a pointed chin and frizzy hair.

== Biography ==
A devious, cunning individual, de Vries was responsible for discovering how to break the [[Imperial Conditioning]] of a [[Suk]] doctor. He discovered that if he held a loved one of the Suk doctors to ransom, he could control their behaviour any way he wished. He forced the betrayal of [[House Atreides]] by Dr. [[Wellington Yueh]]. De Vries had kidnapped Yueh's wife, murdered her, and convinced Yueh that she was still alive. De Vries had promised that he would return his wife to him if he were to do the Harkonnens' bidding. The breaking of Yueh's Imperial Conditioning led to the death of Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]].

=== Death ===
De Vries was killed by Duke Leto when he mistakenly perceived de Vries to be the Baron Harkonnen. In a drugged state, Leto bit down on a poison gas tooth imbedded in his head by Yueh just before Leto was captured during the invasion of [[Arrakis]]. The Baron narrowly escaped, but de Vries was killed. In this way, Yueh managed to exact vengeance on the man that killed his wife.

Paul was born in Shaddam's 57th year. 10176 - 57 = 10119.</ref>] was the eighty-first and last [[Padishah Emperor]] of the [[Corrino Empire]], and thus the [[Known Universe]], reigning from the year [[10156 AG]], when his father Emperor [[Elrood Corrino IX|Elrood IX]] succumbed to [[chaumurky]], until replaced by the Regency set up in the name of his eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], in [[10196 AG]].

After his deposal, he was exiled to his former prison planet of [[Salusa Secundus]] along with Count Fenring and his five daughters, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], [[Chalice Corrino|Chalice]], [[Rugi Corrino|Rugi]], [[Josifa Corrino|Josifa]] and [[Wensicia Corrino|Wensicia]].  

==Biography ==

===Early years===

Shaddam was born in the year 10119 in the Imperial Palace on [[Kaitain]] to [[Elrood Corrino IX|Elrood IX]], the 80th Padishah Emperor. The ''Almanak en-Ashraf'' mistakenly listed his birthdate as 10134.

During his childhood as the Imperial Crown Prince and the heir apparent to the Imperial [[Golden Lion Throne]], Shaddam became close friends with his maternal cousin, Count [[Hasimir Fenring]] who became his closest friend.

=== Ascent to the Throne===

In year [[10156 AG]], Shaddam succeeded his father as the 81st Padishah Emperor and head of Imperial [[House Corrino]], after Elrood IX succumbed to [[chaumurky]]. A frequently discredited history of the Corrinos detailed a story that Count Fenring was responsible for poisoning Elrood.

The ranks of [[Burseg]]s were doubled in the first 16 years of his reign and appropriations for [[Sardaukar]] training went down steadily in the final 30 years.

Shaddam married [[Anirul Corrino|Anirul]], a [[Bene Gesserit]] of [[Hidden Rank]]. Their marriage resulted in the birth of five daughters:
*[[Irulan Corrino]] — The eldest daughter of Shaddam and Anirul, and the Imperial Crown Princess and the heiress apparent to the Imperial Golden Lion Throne of the Galactic Padishah Empire.
*[[Chalice Corrino]] — The second daughter of Shaddam and Anirul, who died unexpectedly on Kaitain or Salusa Secundus.
*[[Wensicia Corrino]] — The third daughter of Shaddam and Anirul, and the former Sovereign Co-regent of the Imperial [[House Corrino]].
*[[Josifa Corrino]] - The fourth daughter of Shaddam and Anirul, and the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Truthsayer]] of the [[Landsraad]].
*[[Rugi Corrino]] - The fifth and youngest daughter of Shaddam and Anirul, and the last Princess of the Imperial [[House Corrino]].

Shaddam's lack of legitimate sons ensured that he was the last ruler of [[House Corrino]].

His wife Anirul died in [[10176 AG]].

===Atreides and the Fall of the Corrino Empire===

[[File:Shaddam_alia.jpg|left|thumb|Alia the Abomination addresses Emperor Shaddam IV.]]

The events leading up Shaddam's fall from power were triggered by the Emperor himself. He reportedly felt threatened by his adoptive cousin, [[Leto Atreides I]], the Duke of [[House Atreides]]. This was because Leto was a charismatic and honourable man, and had become very popular in the [[Landsraad]]. Moreover, Leto had managed to train a small army under [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]] well enough to rival the [[Sardaukar]]. Consequently, the Emperor conspired with [[House Harkonnen]], long time rivals of House Atreides.

In secret, however, Shaddam admired his cousin Leto, and had once mentioned to Irulan that he had wished the political climate that necessitated animosity toward the Atreides did not exist. Moreover, Shaddam had secretly wished that Irulan had been old enough to marry Leto, both because he knew Leto to be an honourable and just man who possessed the love of his people, but also because he would have been an ideal choice for succeeding him, especially since Shaddam had no direct male heirs.

Despite his personal feelings for Leto, Shaddam pressured Leto to surrender the fief of his native planet [[Caladan]] to Count [[Hasimir Fenring]], and to take over the administration and spice mining operations of [[Arrakis]]. House Atreides took control of Arrakis in 10,191.

However, shortly after Leto took control of Arrakis, he and most of his army were soon slain as a result of a combined invasion by [[Sardaukar]] and Harkonnen forces. The attack was a success, and Shaddam considered the threat posed by House Atreides to have ended. However, the Lady [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], and more importantly her son [[Paul Atreides]] survived. They were given sanctuary by the [[Fremen]] and as a result of their skills, they eventually rose to their leadership.

By the year [[10193 AG]], the young Duke had managed to lead the [[Fremen]] in a battle that defeated the Harkonnen and Sardaukar forces on [[Arrakis]]. As a result, they were able to halt the [[Spice Melange|melange]] trade. Shaddam IV was forced to step down from the throne, and thus end his reign of forty years, and the Imperial reign of [[House Corrino]] that had lasted ten thousand years.

In [[10196 AG]], Shaddam was exiled to his ancestral planet of [[Salusa Secundus]] along with his four younger daughters and Count [[Hasimir Fenring]]. Princess [[Irulan Corrino]] was named Sovereign Co-regent, but Paul Atreides effectively ruled as Emperor as her husband. The ''Almanak en-Ashraf'' mistakenly listed that Shaddam Corrino IV died in year [[10202 AG]] at the age of 68. However, he was still alive in the year [[10208 AG]], and was putting his Sardaukar through landing maneuvers on Salusa Secundus. 

==Physical Appearance==

Shaddam Corrino IV was a slim and elegant man, with red hair, a thin face, and cold eyes. The aforementioned face and eyes reminded the Baron Harkonnen of Duke Leto Atreides I - Shaddam had "that same look of the predatory bird.

==In Other Media==

In both the [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film]] and the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 miniseries]], Shaddam appears older than he is described in the book, though a line of dialogue in the film suggests he is still older than he looks as the spice was said to have "allowed him to live for over 200 years".

Shaddam does not appear in the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film]], but is mentioned by the Herald of the Change during the ceremony making the transfer of House Atreides from Caladan to Arrakis official.

Christopher Walken is set to play Shaddam in ''[[Dune: Part Two]]''.

Shaddam is shown to have died during the events of the 2003 miniseries ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'' (specifically the section adapting [[Dune Messiah]]).

'''House Moritani''' was a [[House]] Major during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. Their ancestral home was the planet [[Grumman]]. House Moritani had a long-standing feud with [[House Ginaz]], which eventually saw the latter defeated in a [[War of Assassins]]. The emperors of [[House Corrino]], particularly [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]], supported House Moritani, and [[House Atreides]] supported House Ginaz.

[[Duncan Idaho]], a [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] of the Ginaz, stated that his "sword was first blooded on Grumman", indicating that his first real experience in mortal combat was part of this feud. Whether this was before or after he entered the service of House Atreides is ambiguous.

Pre-born
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-08-11-29-15-1.png|thumb]]

The term '''"Pre-born"''' was used to refer to someone who was fully aware as a personality long before actual birth, able to peruse their ancestral memories in the same way as a [[Reverend Mother]]. According to the [[Bene Gesserit]], a pre-born was vulnerable to be over-powered by a memory (or ancestor-ego) of theirs and could go insane.

==Alia==

[[Alia Atreides]] was pre-born, shocked to awareness when [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] took the [[Water of Life]] while she was pregnant. This resulted in the Sisterhood giving Alia the title of "Accursed One". She did eventually become possessed by the ancestor [[ego-memory]] of the [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]].

==Ghanima and Leto==

Both [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] and [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] Atreides were also pre-born, but each found their own way to come to terms with their internal awareness and ancestry to avoid the fate of their aunt.

==Behind the Scenes==
In the [[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|2003 ''Children of Dune'' miniseries]], all three pre-born characters (Alia, Ghanima, and Leto II) are played by actors significantly older than them, suggesting that accelerated physical maturation is a side effect of pre-birth.

The Imperial '''House Corrino''' was once the deadliest and grandest House Major found within the Known universe, and for many thousands of years the imperial family of the [[Imperium]]. The official residence of the Imperial House Corrino was the planet [[Kaitain/DE|Kaitain]] while their personal fief was the ancestral exile planet [[Salusa Secundus/DE|Salusa Secundus]]


== Origins ==
{{encyclopedia}}
According to historians, the House Corrino, descends from [[Thomas Palaiologos]], the brother of [[Constantine XI]], the last Emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[House Harkonnen/DE|House Harkonnen]] claimed descent from them too, but this was not proven.

[[Kruwl Sheivvun]] believed that the collapse of interstellar commerce caused by the [[Butlerian Jihad/DE|Butlerian Jihad]] left space for the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]] to assemble, and for House Corrino to ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]].

The House Corrino was formed when Count ([[burseg/DE|Burseg]]) [[Sheuset Ecevit]] of the [[Sardau]] wanted to ensure the position of his house and waged war against the other [[Great Houses/DE|important houses]] of the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]]. His greatest military power were his [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]], an invincible fighting force in land battle.

Eventually in the [[Battle of Corrin/DE|Battle of Corrin]] he defeated the Landsraad forces. Ecevit thought that his Sardaukar might win an extended war but their empire would be a graveyard. He decided to compromise, and with the [[Treaty of Corrin]] became the first [[Padishah Emperor/DE|Emperor]] of the new Imperium, '''Sheuset Costin I'''. His family became the Imperial House Corrino, named after the planet [[Corrin/DE|Corrin]]. Most of the Great Houses pre-dated the rise of the House of Corrino, and regarded the success of the barbarians from Salusa Secundus as a freak of history which could and should be rectified.

After the reformation of Count [[Iason Atreides]] (around [[603 AG]]) the Emperor was responsible for his actions to the [[Imperial Family]]. He managed to concentrate most of the imperial power in his hands and reorganized the government reestablishing the principles of the [[Great Convention]]; now instead of a chaotic personal rule now it became a trierarchy: The Imperial seat, the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]] and [[CHOAM/DE|CHOAM]] and the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]].

== Rule ==
{{Original}}
Over the subsequent millennia, the Imperial House Corrino maintained a firm grip on the Empire.

House Corrino's rule was defined as absolute while one of its members sat on the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Moreover, House Corrino maintained a large vote in the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]], larger than any other Great House.

During their Imperial rule, House Corrino maintained arguably the most powerful army in the known universe - the [[Sardaukar/DE|Sardaukar]]. Through their superior abilities the Corrinos were capable of crushing any military opposition. It was said that the only way the Corrino Sardaukar could be defeated would be through the combined forces of all the Great Houses of the Landsraad.

== Downfall of the Corrino Empire ==
Complacency and corruption eventually weakening the Sardaukar. That, combined with ill-considered decisions by [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]] and the scheming of the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]], eventually saw other Great Houses, particularly [[House Atreides/DE|House Atreides]], acquire significant respect and credibility in the Imperium.

In an attempt to discredit House Atreides and retain their hegemony, the Imperial House Corrino under the leadership of Shaddam IV, devised a plan to dispose of their potential rival by ordering them to take over the planetary [[fief]] of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], and then disposing of them through their hated rival [[House Harkonnen/DE|House Harkonnen]], via an audacious, and highly illegal, invasion of the planet.

Initially the plan looked to have succeeded. [[Duke]] [[Leto I Atreides]] was killed, and his family abandoned in the [[deep desert]]. However, a gradual uprising by the native [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]], led by the mysterious [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] caught both House Corrino and House Harkonnen off-guard.

After the [[Arrakis Revolt]] and the Battle of the Arakeen Plane, House Corrino was forced to relinquish the [[Golden Lion Throne]], after thousands of years of rule, to the Atreides. The Corrinos witnessed the legitimization of Atreides rule through Paul's marriage to Shaddam's eldest daughter Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan Corrino]]. Shaddam IV and the remainder of his family were then sent into effective exile on the harsh planet Salusa Secundus, where one of Shaddam's four other daughters, [[Wensicia Corrino/DE|Wensicia]] plotted the Great House's re-emergence.

== Failed Re-emergence ==
However, Wensicia's plans were also foiled by Atreides, and her son, Prince [[Farad'n Corrino]] became the official concubine of his step-cousin, the Crown Princess [[Ghanima Atreides]]. In addition to providing the Atreides offspring that were needed for [[Leto II Atreides II|Leto II]]'s [[Golden Path]], Farad'n also acted as his official scribe.

This spelled the effective end of House Corrino. Although their bloodline survived, inextricably mixed with the descendants of Paul Atreides, as a Great House the Corrinos ceased to be.

Ix
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:Ix.png|thumb]]

'''Ix''' was the ninth planet in the star system [[Alkalurops]]. The Ixian economy depended on manufacturing complex machinery, which sometimes flouts the moral-juridical proscriptions of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. The inhabitants of Ix were known collectively as the '''Ixians'''.

== History ==
It is implied that the Ixians' origin might have been some Asian culture of [[Earth|Old Earth]], likely Chinese. The planet's name originated with a misinterpretation of the Roman numeral ''IX'' (9).<ref>''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]''</ref>

Ix, along with [[Richese]], escaped the more severe effects of the Butlerian Jihad, leading to it being classed as supreme in machine culture.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Terminology of the Imperium: '''RICHESE'''</ref> 

The planet formed an [[Ixian Confederacy]] when [[Paul Atreides]] took the [[Golden Lion Throne]] and became Emperor of the [[Known Universe]] in [[10196 AG]]. Ix offered submission to House Atreides in [[10208 AG]] in exchange for a legal limit to Paul's Imperial tax, claiming that they wanted a constitution, with the [[Landsraad]] or [[CHOAM]] governing Paul. Paul forbade a constitution, claiming it would be detrimental to his people. This became an Order in Council and Paul decreed that the Guild, if they wanted his signature for the [[The Tupile Treaty|Tupile Treaty]], was to stop all trade from [[Ix]] until the Confederacy agreed to the tax. Without the Guild's transport, the Ixians eventually submitted.

Early on in the reign of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]], [[Leto Atreides II]], the Ixians, spreading their machine-based civilization, the [[Ixian|Ixians]] developed an economic technological federation with a center named the [[Ixian Core]].<ref>[[God Emperor of Dune|''God Emperor of Dune'',]] page 151.</ref> Later on they began to no longer followed the orders of the Butlerian Jihad; in secret, they produced outright computers again.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]],'' page 158</ref>

In the last centuries of the God Emperor's reign, they invented the no-field, which allowed them to grow [[Hwi Noree]], who was bred in a no-room to heavily impact upon Leto's emotions and disrupt his [[Golden Path]]. Meanwhile, they worked with the [[Spacing Guild]] to develop a mechanical subtitute for the [[Guild Navigator|Guild Navigators]]' predictive talents.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]],'' page 76</ref> The Guild-Ix project succeeded a few decades after the God Emperor's death with the development of the first generation of Ixian [[Navigation machine|Navigation Machines]], which broke the Spacing Guild’s monopoly over spaceflight.

During the [[Famine Times]], the Ixians rose up to become a major power in the [[Known Universe]]. The Ixians were the first to invent and manufacture [[no-ship]]s. Along with being guided by the new Navigation Machines, these vessels had the additional advantage of being far cheaper than traditional space ships. It was the development of this cheaper form of [[space travel]] which fueled the [[Scattering]].

By the time of the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]] in the [[Atreides Empire|Old Imperium]], the power of the Ixians was at its apex, due to their alliance with the [[Fish Speakers]], but the analysists of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood saw them as a failing power, as Ixian society had become a bureaucracy, with no great inventions coming out of the workshops of Ix for centuries. When the [[Honored Matres]] conquered the Old Empire, the Ixians were reduced to being a barely tolerated technological combine.

Malky
{{Or-DE,Ex}}[[File:Img163.jpg|thumb|Malky - Illustration by Klaus D. Schiemann]]

'''Malky''' [d. [[13728 AG]]] was the [[Ixian]] Ambassador to [[Arrakis]] during the later years of the reign of [[Leto Atreides II]], the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]].

He was known to have unofficial dispensation to discuss taboo topics with Leto, because Leto was fond of him. He apparently possessed some special insight into Leto and his [[Golden Path]]. At some stage, Malky was recalled to [[Ix]]. Shortly thereafter, [[Iyo Kobat]] was sent to take his place. 

Upon his niece Hwi Noree's arrival on Arrakis, it was discovered that Malky was involved in Hwi's conception and development. When it had been announced that Leto and Hwi were to wed, Malky was recalled to Arrakis by Leto, and murdered by [[Moneo Atreides]], the God-Emperor's majordomo.

Judaism
{{Original}}
[[File:Sixbranchedmenorah.jpg|thumb]]
'''Judaism''' was a monotheistic, Semitic [[:Category:Religion|religion]] originating from [[Old Earth]]. It was the only religion from Old Earth that survived intact throughout the millennia.  At least one Jewish community had survived on [[Gammu]] and there was evidence that others existed or had existed on [[Salusa Secundus]] and [[Nework]].

This group of Jewish survivors had survived as a secret society, protected and supported by the [[Bene Gesserit]] through a pact of both-sided loyalty, though they sometimes felt amused or dismayed by what they thought of as the Bene Gesserit copying them. Eons ago, after the many pogroms following the [[Commission of Ecumenical Translators]] and the establishment of the [[Orange Catholic Bible|Orange Catholic]] [[Ecumenism]], they had decided to completely vanish from public view and therefore hid on countless planets, some of which had been settled by no other humans than themselves. They called this practice the ''complete cover'' and it was possible for a person to work and live a lifetime beside a Jew without ever suspecting. Still they preserved their age-old practices, though somewhat altered. Their small communities were led by [[Rabbi]]s but some chosen women practiced the [[spice agony]] and were able to absorb and save other people's collective memory, making them virtually wild [[Reverend Mother]]s, a fact they had decided to hide from the true [[Bene Gesserit]].

It is notable that the term ''Kwisatz Haderach'' is an Anglicized pronunciation of the phrase קפיצת הדרך (''kefitzat haderech) w''hich translates as "the shortening of the way” or "the leap of the path"  and is used a concept mentioned in Jewish texts as a miraculously rapid transportation between two physical locations. The term is not used in reference to the awaited Jewish Messiah.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefitzat_Haderech]

Several groups or organisations that seem to be of Jewish origin sent delegates to the synode which redacted the [[Orange Catholic Bible]]: The ''Diasporic Council of Rabbis'', ''Talimidic Zabur Followers'', the ''Jerusalem Urbanite Citizens of Nework'', the ''Neomaimondist Rabbirate'' and The ''Tawrah Collegiate'', as well as a number of seemingly mixed-religions such as: The ''Christian Zionist Pilgrims'', The ''Hasidic Lutherans'' and the ''Hasidislamic Union'' but their exact relation to judaism remains obscure and it is unknown in how far these Jewish or pseudo-Jewish groups differed from the Judaism of [[Earth|Old Terra]], though of all religions, Judaism had changed the least throughout the millennia.

Sietch Jacurutu
{{Original}}

[[File:Jacurutu.png|thumb|350px|Jacurutu , Children of Dune TV Miniseries]]
[[File:Ruben-karamanites-sietch-jacurutu2.jpg|thumb]]


[[File:Fondak.png|thumb|350px|Attack on Fondak - Children of Dune TV miniseries]]

'''Sietch Jacurutu''', also known as '''Fondak''', was a legendary sietch located in the [[deep desert]] of [[Arrakis]], associated with [[Shuloch]]. For many years the [[Fremen]] thought Jacurutu was a myth, and little was remembered of its origin. It was rumored that its people had been cast out from Fremen society for stealing water.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Long before the arrival of [[House Atreides]] on Arrakis, during the times of Stilgar's great-great-grandfather, a group of renegade Fremen based in Jacurutu caused havoc on the arid planet by killing other Fremen for the water contained in their bodies. 

The other tribes called the group [[Iduali]], meaning "water insects", and banded together to wipe out Sietch Jacurutu. The name Jacurutu became taboo after the massacre. No Fremen could search for it.

The surviving Iduali rebuilt Sietch Jacurutu and named it Fondak.

=== Discovery by Leto Atreides II ===
During the rule of [[Alia Atreides]], [[Leto Atreides II]] faked his own death and set off to discover the secrets of Jacurutu. Upon discovering the location, he was captured by [[Gurney Halleck]] under Jessica's orders. Gurney believed he was testing Leto for signs of abomination, however, the true motives behind his orders are up for debate. During the testing, Leto took a frempack and escaped into a sandstorm, unaware that his heel pumps had been cut.

After escaping from Jacurutu and then [[Shuloch]], Leto used the resources of the Cast-Out to lay the foundations of his [[Golden Path]].

Spice blow
{{Original}}
[[File:41baO7uV4cL-1.jpg|thumb|Spice Blow as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

'''Spice blows''' were an event on [[Arrakis]] that resulted in the [[Spice Melange]] being pushed up to the surface of the desert. They were caused by immense pressure building up within the [[pre-spice mass]], deep below the planet's surface. A spice blow was known to have caused the death of [[Liet Kynes]].

<p class="MsoNormal">Unlike regular spice masses exposed by the elements that are harvested, it is located deep in the sand. It is characterized by the presence of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Due to this dangerous factor, worms will not approach it even after two hours of spice harvesting. The increase of gas leakage creates a resonance that is a factor in creating a spice blow. The blow itself is reminiscent of the Salusan mudpot. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Initially it can be mistaken for an ancient aquifer buried under a rock cap.</p>

Powindah
{{Original}}

'''Powindah''' was a term commonly used by the [[Bene Tleilax]] to describe any individual not born into the Tleilaxu culture, or anyone who did not believe in their very specific and esoteric religious beliefs. The term meant ''non-believer'', although it was used in a much more derogatory sense than its literal translation with terms such as infidel, apostate and heathen having similar connotations. The word was rarely spoken around non-Tleilaxu.

Kangaroo mouse
{{Original}}

A '''kangaroo mouse''' or '''muad'dib''' in [[Chakobsa]], is a small rodent from the planet [[Arrakis]]. It was associated in the Fremen earth-spirit mythology and its figure was visible on the planet's [[Muad'dib (moon)|second moon]], as well as on a [[Muad'dib (constellation)|constellation]].


[[Paul Atreides]] took the name of Muad'Dib when he was welcomed into the Fremen tribes. 

This creature is admired by Fremen for its ability to survive in the open desert. Young Fremen are required to learn from their ways of survival. Thus while Paul's new Fremen name literally meant "the mouse" (which Baron Harkonnen found amusing), on a more figurative level it meant "The Teacher".

The Imperial '''House Corrino''' was once the deadliest and grandest House Major found within the Known universe, and for many thousands of years the imperial family of the [[Imperium]]. The official residence of the Imperial House Corrino was the planet [[Kaitain]] while their personal fief was the ancestral exile planet [[Salusa Secundus]].

== Origins ==
The events after the [[Battle of Corrin]] saw the newly formed House Corrino capture rulership of the new [[Imperium]].

== Rule ==
Over the subsequent millennia, the Imperial House Corrino maintained a firm grip on the Empire.

House Corrino's rule was defined as absolute while one of its members sat on the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Moreover, House Corrino maintained a large vote in the [[Landsraad Council]], larger than any other Great House.

During their Imperial rule, House Corrino maintained arguably the most powerful army in the known universe - the [[Sardaukar]]. Through their superior abilities the Corrinos were capable of crushing any military opposition. It was said that the only way the Corrino Sardaukar could be defeated would be through the combined forces of all the Great Houses of the [[Landsraad]].

The Corrino were, presumably, just rulers of the [[Imperium]] as no known issues other than Arrakis were known, but they would backstab and use treacherous tactics in order to maintain their seat in power but without getting openly involved, such as when they supplied [[Sardaukar]] to the Harkonnen to deal with the Atreides.

== Downfall of the Corrino Empire ==
Complacency, inactivity and corruption eventually weakened the [[Sardaukar]]. That, combined with ill-considered decisions by [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and the scheming of the [[Bene Gesserit]], eventually saw other Great Houses, particularly [[House Atreides]], acquire significant respect and credibility in the Imperium.

In an attempt to discredit House Atreides and retain their hegemony, the Imperial House Corrino under the leadership of Shaddam IV, devised a plan to dispose of their potential rival by ordering them to take over the planetary [[fief]] of [[Arrakis]], and then disposing of them through their hated rival [[House Harkonnen]], via an audacious, and highly illegal, invasion of the planet.

Initially the plan looked to have succeeded. [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]] was killed, and his family abandoned in the [[deep desert]]. However, a gradual uprising by the native [[Fremen]], led by the mysterious [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] caught both House Corrino and House Harkonnen off-guard.

After the [[Arrakis Revolt]] and the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], House Corrino was forced to relinquish the [[Golden Lion Throne]], after thousands of years of rule, to the Atreides. The Corrinos witnessed the legitimization of Atreides rule through [[Paul Atreides|Paul Atreides']] marriage to Shaddam's eldest daughter Princess [[Irulan Corrino]]. Shaddam IV and the remainder of his family were then sent into effective exile on the harsh planet [[Salusa Secundus]], where one of Shaddam's four other daughters, [[Wensicia Corrino]] plotted the Great House's re-emergence.

== Failed re-emergence ==
However, Wensicia's plans were also foiled by the [[House Atreides|Atreides]], and her son, Prince [[Farad'n Corrino]] became the official concubine of his step-cousin, the Crown Princess [[Ghanima Atreides]]. In addition to providing the Atreides offspring that were needed for [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II's]] [[Golden Path]], Farad'n also acted as his official scribe. Despite this, and the reality that House Corrino had lost most of its power, the House continued to exist at least through the end of Leto II's reign.

The '''Panoplia Propheticus''' is the collective term used to describe the superstitions and prophecies laid down by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood. The Panoplia's constituent superstitions and prophecies varied depending on exactly how primitive a particular culture was and by how much control a Bene Gesserit would need to accomplish her goals. For example, the Missionaria Protectiva seeded [[Arrakis]] with the [[Mahdi]] legend, which Lady Jessica noted was reserved only for planets where conditions were so awful that a Bene Gesserit would potentially need to assume total control of the surrounding culture.

'''Groundcars''' were traditional [[vehicles]] of locomotion on a planet's surface. Groundcars could combine traditional wheels and antigravity floater bulbs or [[suspensor]]s and even jet-pod modification. Due to the fact hat [[Holtzman]] [[shield]]s would attract [[Sandworm]]s and [[Sandstorm]]s could disarm shields, Groundcars on Arrakis were mostly without antigravity systems and shields or were limited in use to the areas secured by the [[Shield Wall]]. On many [[Planets]] Groundcars had been largely replaced by faster ways of transportation such as [[universal transport pods]], [[Tube-train]]s and [[transport tubes]].

House Harkonnen
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{Houseinfo

'''House Harkonnen''' was a [[House Major|Great House]] of the [[Landsraad]]. The Harkonnen capital was [[Giedi Prime]], a heavily industrialised planet with a low photosynthetic potential. House Harkonnen was most famous for its underhanded and sinister political tactics, and for an ancient [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] it maintained with another Great House, [[House Atreides]]. In addition, House Harkonnen had a reputation for ambition, malevolence, hatred and brutality. It was typically ruled by a Siridar Baron.

== History ==
===Origins===
The Harkonnen name was believed to originate in what was northern Europe on ancient [[Earth]], and the region of Earth called Suomi, also Finland. It has been suggested that the Harkonnen name comes from Sweden as a derivation of Hakkon - but it is likely that it is indeed from Finland, as Härkönen is a 20th-century Finnish name. Moreover, the family name Härkönen is derived from the Finnish word ''härkä'' which means ox.

===Emergence as a Great House===
After many centuries toiling as a [[House|House Minor]], Harkonnen influence gradually rose within the [[Landsraad]], due mostly to shrewd manipulation of the whale fur market, which was primarily accomplished by Baron [[Dmitri Harkonnen]] and his son Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]].

House Harkonnen had built its power on maximising production output, and minimising production expenses by ignoring economically ethical behaviour. Indeed, Harkonnen governing was based upon a simple foundation of fear and terror. They were used in governance, in the day-to-day running of the Harkonnen household, and in controlling the Harkonnen armies. With a social order based on treachery and punishment, soldiers rose through the ranks through deceit, trickery and, if necessary, assassination.

In approximately [[10130 AG]], House Harkonnen won the [[fief|siridar fief]] of [[Arrakis]]. Their responsibility was to mine the [[spice melange]] and supply it to the universe. Through their persecution of the [[Fremen]], and through the minimisation of outlay on infrastructure and pay, the Harkonnens managed to pay the tithe they owed to the Emperor, as well as keep a substantial amount of melange for themselves. By [[10191 AG]], the Harkonnens had managed to amass considerable wealth through spice mining.

===Demise===
Despite House Harkonnen's relative power prior to the end of the [[House Corrino|Corrino]] Empire, Vladimir Harkonnen desired the ultimate achievement of usurping the Corrinos and forming the Harkonnen Empire. Thus, he secretly plotted against both [[House Atreides]] and [[House Corrino]], hoping to destroy the former and overpower the latter through force and marriage.

However, Vladimir Harkonnen's plans were ultimately unravelled by the rise of [[Paul Atreides]] on [[Arrakis]]. After Vladimir Harkonnen's death at the hands of Paul's younger sister, [[Alia Atreides]] in [[10193 AG]], the title of Baron passed very briefly to his nephew, [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]], before being killed by [[Paul Atreides]] in an act of [[kanly]].

After the ascent of House Atreides, what little remained of House Harkonnen saw its power and resources quickly disappear. Control of Giedi Prime was given to the people of [[Caladan]], and under the direction of [[Gurney Halleck]], once a slave on that world, its machines of industry were dismantled, its name and those of its cities were changed, and its forests and greenery replanted. House Harkonnen essentially ceased to be during the time of [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]]. However, the Harkonnen bloodline continued to exist through [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding programs for more than 1500 years thereafter, and ultimately through the mingling with the Atreides bloodline, with [[Paul Atreides]] being the grandson of Vladimir Harkonnen.

==Behind the Scenes==
* Frank Herbert said in later interviews that he modeled the fictional Harkonnens after the [[Wikipedia:Nazi Party|Nazi Party]].
* Within Frank Herbert's continuity, the official seal of House Harkonnen bore the image of a griffin. The ''[[Dune Encyclopedia]]'' altered it to a ram which was followed by video game adaptations developed by Westwood Studios.  Though it might be possible that the Harkonnen Griffin was Ram-headed.  In Finnish, “Härkönen” translates as “Oxy” or “Ox-like-person”.  Giedi Prime's name probably stems from Arabic "al-Jadii" (Lit. The Goat), so the Harkonnens connection with horned animals is evident.
*  The rise of House Harkonnen was an example of how, in the Faufreluches system, a House Minor could become a House Major through the accumulation of wealth. It could be determined, therefore, that one of the faults of the [[Faufreluches]] system was that a banished House could return if they became rich enough.
*Frank Herbert got the name "Harkonnen" from the Finnish name "Härkönen", which he found in a California telephone book. He wanted a harsh-sounding name for the villains of his novel, and "Harkonnen" sounded "Soviet".

[[File:Screenshot_2019-02-27-18-42-49-1.png|thumb]]

A '''Spacefolder''' is a space craft capable of travelling at [[Space travel#Faster than light travel|faster than light]] speeds, thanks to the [[Holtzman Effect]]. In the eras of the [[Corrino Empire|Corrino]] and [[Atreides Empire|Atreides]] Empires, spacefolder vessels were typically controlled by the [[Spacing Guild]], however, by the time of the discovery of the [[Dar-es-Balat]] hoard, Ixian [[navigation machine]]s had broken the guild monopoly on space travel.

Timeline (Original Dune)
{{Original}}

This is a timeline of [[known universe|universal]] history. The date system used in this timeline is the [[Universal Standard Calendar]].

==Timeline==
;;[[11200 BG]]
;;* The beginning of [[space travel]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]],'' Appendix II, page 543.  "Mankind's movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion during the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the Butlerian Jihad." The Jihad was 201-108 BG, so this would approximately be 11,100-11,200 BG.</ref>  <br />
;;
;;
;;c. [[11000 BG]]
;;* Following the [[Second Interspace Migrations]], the [[Jews]] hide their identity from the non-Jews.<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', page 33. "The society she had in mind had supposedly died out shortly after the Second Interspace Migrations." The name "Second Interspace Migrations" implies a wave during the very early period of space travel, which began in 1960 or 11200 BG. So circa 11000 BG or 2160. </ref>  <br />

;;<br />c. [[5000 BG]]
;;*[[Sandtrout]] are brought to water-rich [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] and begin [[Desertification of Arrakis|desertification]]. Sandtrout-[[sandworm/XD|sandworm]]-[[spice/XD|melange]] cycle begins.<ref>''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]'', page 33. The date of c. 5000 BG is attained from another broadly guessed date, that of the discovery of the spice c. 1000 BG, when Arrakis must already have become a desert.</ref>   <br />
;;<br />c. 2100 BG
;;* The [[Great Houses]] of the [[Landsraad]] are established.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Appendix II. "The major dams against anarchy in these times were the embryo Guild, the Bene Gesserit and the Landsraad, which continued its 2,000 year record of meeting in spite of the severest obstacles." The time referred to is the period after the end of the Butlerian JIhad in 108 BG. 108 + 2000 = 2108, rounded to 2100.</ref>  <br />

;c. 1580 BG
;* The [[Second Islamic Movement]] begins under the [[Second Muhammad]].  <br />
;;c. 1480 BG
;;* The [[Third Islamic Movement]] begins under the Prophet [[Maometh]], the Third Muhammad.   <br /> <br />
;;[[1381 BG]]
;;* The [[Zensunni]] led by [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] break away from the teachings of [[Maometh]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Terminology of the Imperium: '''ZENSUNNI'''. "followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of Maometh (the so-called "Third Muhammed" about 1381 B.G."</ref>  <br /> <br />
;;
;;c. 1380-1300 BG
;;* The [[Zensunni Wanderers]] roam from one world to another in search of freedom from persecution and enslavement by the [[Imperial raiders]] before ultimately landing on Arrakis, here they evolve into the [[Fremen]] people of the deep desert over thousands of years.

;;c. 1000 BG
;;* During the rule of [[Shakkad the Wise]] the scholar [[Yanshuph Ashkoko]] [[Discovery of Melange|discovers]] the geriatric [[spice]] melange on [[Arrakis]].<ref name=":0">''[[Children of Dune (novel)|Children of Dune]]'', page 18. "spice of Arrakis (Dune) with geriatric properties first noted by Yansuph Ashkoko, royal chemist in reign of Shakkad the Wise." The spice must have already been discovered by the times after the Butlerian Jihad, which produced the spice-dependent Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild. Therefore, a date of approx. 1000 BG is likely, but far from certain.</ref>
[[8th century BG]]

* [[Tibana]], an apologist for [[Socratic Christinanity]] from [[IV Anbus]], writes: ‘The hearts of all men dwell in the same wilderness’.<ref>''[[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]'', page 235</ref>
;[[201 BG]]
* The [[Butlerian Jihad]] against [[Computer|computers]], [[Thinking Machines|thinking machines]], and conscious [[robots]] begins.<ref name=":1">''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Terminology of the Imperium: '''''JIHAD, BUTLERIAN'''''. "...begun in 201 B.G. and concluded in 108 B.G."</ref>
[[108 BG]]
* The Butlerian Jihad ends<ref name=":1" /> after wiping out most of the machine-based technology and also the majority of historical documents. The god of machine-logic is overthrown by the masses and a new concept is raised: "Man may not be replaced."<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Appendix II: The Religion of Dune, page 544</ref> Culture based on the production of highly developed machines survives only on [[Ix]] and [[Richese]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Terminology of the Imperium: '''RICHESE'''</ref>
c. [[98 BG]]

* Foundation of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood.<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Terminology of the Imperium: '''BENE GESSERIT'''. "the ancient school of mental and physical training established primarily for female students after the Butlerian Jihad destroyed the so-called "thinking machines" and robots." 

''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', page 34. "We did not disturb the situation until I, Mother Superior during and after the battle of Corrin..."


Therefore, the Sisterhood was formed at some time between the end of the Jihad (108 BG) and the Battle of Corrin (88 BG). So, circa 98 BG.


</ref>
;[[88 BG|&nbsp; 88 BG]]
* [[Battle of Corrin]]. [[House Corrino]] takes its name and establishes the [[Corrino Empire]] from [[Salusa Secundus]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]],'' Terminology of the Imperium: '''CORRIN, BATTLE OF'''.

*The [[Golden Lion Throne]] is set up.
*[[Unnamed Atreides|An Atreides]] banishes [[Bashar]] [[Abulurd Harkonnen|Abulurd Harkonennen]] for cowardice, beginning the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud]].<ref name=":2">''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Appendix IV, VLADIMIR HARKONNEN.

The Order then spreads into uncounted "seed schools".<ref>''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', page 243.</ref>
*[[Norma Cenva]] marries [[Aurelius Venport]] and they have five children. Norma designs the first [[Fold space|foldspace]] ship, and gives it to Venport, who is remembered as the designer.<ref name=":3">[[God Emperor of Dune]], page 180. "You think a man designed the first Guild ship? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport? They lied. It was his mistress, Norma. She gave him the design along with five children."</ref>

It will later be expanded to include those deadly devices permitted under the [[Guild Peace]] and [[Great Convention]].<ref>''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Terminology of the Imperium: '''ASSASSINS’ HANDBOOK'''</ref>
c. 2000 AG

* The Imperial court is removed to [[Kaitain]], the new capital, and Salusa Secundus is designated the Imperial Prison Planet.<ref>In ''Children of Dune'', we learn that the laza tigers were brought to Salusa in the 2200s - so the change in the capital happened before this date.

In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', Liet has been Imperial planetologist for some time, as indicated not only by the end of Appendix I but the fact that he has had enough time to become something of a religious figure among the Fremen. An estimate of fifteen years would put his father's death at 10175 and his birth at 10156, which matches with the Children of Dune calculation as Liet must have been born, early, because of his age in dune, but not too early, because he was already a teenager when his father died, in Pardot's time with the Fremen.</ref>

Schwangyu
{{Original}}

[[File:2019-03-01_08.35.41.jpg|thumb|Chapterhouse:Dune book cover]]

[[Reverend Mother]] '''Schwangyu''' was the [[Bene Gesserit]] Reverend Mother who was in command of Bene Gesserit forces on the planet [[Gammu]] during the time of the return of the [[Honored Matres]] from the Scattering.

Schwangyu came into conflict with Reverend Mother [[Lucilla]] and [[Bashar]] [[Miles Teg]] regarding the training of the present [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]]. She believed that the ghola was too dangerous a weapon for the Bene Gesserit to wield. As a result, she betrayed Teg, the ghola, and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood by permitting the [[Bene Tleilax]] to attack and destroy the Gammu keep in order to capture the ghola. However, Teg, Lucilla, and the ghola managed to escape, while Schwangyu was killed in the attack.

[[File:Dune-ccg-eye-of-the-storm-hostage-option-119r_518qGKkcZdL-1.jpg|thumb|Bhotani]]

The term '''bhotani''' had two meanings:

* Bhotani, also known as ''Bhotani Jib'', was the name given to an ancient and long forgotten dialect from which the secretive hunting language [[Chakobsa]] evolved.
* Bhotani also referred to a culture of hired assassins who became prominent during the First [[War of Assassins]]. This group were the primary speakers of Chakobsa.

Appendix II: The Religion of Dune
{{Original}}

'''Appendix II: The Religion of Dune''' is the second of 4 [[Appendices]] found at the end of the first [[Dune]] novel. As the title suggests, it provides a brief history of the origin of the religion of Dune. It is unclear who the narrative voice belongs to. They seem within the Dune universe but outside the actual events, as though a historian's notes were somehow published long after the events had occurred. The piece is critical of the [[Bene Gesserit]], and it offers insights into subjects that are otherwise hardly mentioned.

==Early History==
The ''poison drug'' of [[Rossak]] was the first narcotic to unlock the [[Other Memory]] of a [[Zensunni]] woman (probably an old [[Sayyadina]]). The Zensunni history had been passed orally between the Sayyadinas through many times before the usage and refinement of this drug by their wild [[Reverend Mothers]]. These women started to secure their own history by [[Other Memory]] and [[Sharing]] process, because it is virtually unforgettable.

The ''Poison Rossak drug'' was surpassed by the [[Water of Life]] when the [[Wandering Zensunni]] had been forced to migrate to [[Arrakis]], probably because the [[Water of Life]] is much more efficient than it.

The empire was established in the year [[88 BG]] following the [[Battle of Corrin]], and lasted until [[Paul Atreides]] usurped [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] after the epochal  [[Arrakis Revolt]] and founded the replacing [[Atreides Empire]] in [[10196 AG]]. The seat of power of the Imperium was initially the planet [[Salusa Secundus]], the traditional home of House Corrino. However, it was later moved to [[Kaitain]].

The Corrino Empire provided a socioeconomic and political framework within which the [[Faufreluches]] class system operated.

Genetics
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-07-26-03-14-16-1.png|thumb|Genetic research - Dune CCG]]

'''Genetics''' (from the ancient Greek γεννώ [gen'no:] = give birth) was the science of genes, heredity, and the variation of organisms.

Thanks mainly to the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Bene Tleilax]], genetics played a fundamental role in [[human]] history, from before the [[Butlerian Jihad]] through to the return of the [[Honored Matres]].

==Methods of Controling Genetics==
Two methods of genetic manipulation were used by cultures within the [[known universe]].

===Breeding Programs===
Though they took millennia to run and were highly susceptible to outside forces, breeding programs were seen by many as a more socially acceptable method of manipulating human evolution.

The [[Bene Gesserit]] were the undeniable masters of this form of genetic manipulation, having sought for over 10,000 years to create and control the [[Kwisatz Hadarach]]. Through careful analysis and record keeping their goal was realized in [[Paul Atreides]]. However, the ultimate outcome proved much more complicated, and thanks to the rebellious actions of a few individuals - most notably Paul's mother [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] - their program had several unwanted major repercussions.

===Laboratory Genetics===
Laboratory-style genetic manipulations, such as those performed by the [[Bene Tleilax]], offered much quicker returns and allowed for greater control of their subjects than breeding programs. However, such methods were also not without their problems.

Despite dilligent and detailed attempts to embed control mechanisms in their subjects, the Tleilaxu often achieved only mixed results. Their plot to disrupt the [[Atreides Empire]] failed when [[Hayt]], the first [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] not only recovered his previous memories, but killed the undercover [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Bijaz]]. Further attempts to control the destiny of [[Leto Atreides II]], the [[God Emperor]], also largely failed. As did their later attempts to supersede the Bene Gesserit.

Sayyadina
{{Original}}
[[File:GW361H272.jpg|thumb]]
The term '''Sayyadina''' (meaning "friend of God" in [[Chakobsa]]) was used by the [[Fremen]] to describe their lower-ranking priestesses who had not yet changed the [[Water of Life]] and become [[Reverend Mother]]s.

Often, a woman would be consecrated as Sayyadina at the same time that the previous Sayyadina attempted the [[spice agony]], so that all would not be lost if the potential Reverend Mother failed and died. This occurred when [[Ramallo]], at the end of her life, supervised Lady Jessica's spice agony; since Ramallo was moments from death, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of Liet, was consecrated as Sayyadina in the event that Jessica did not survive.

Poverty grass
{{Original}}
'''Poverty grass''' is a thin-leafed plant found on the planet [[Arrakis]]. This grass was used by [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] in his terraforming program of that planet.
{{encyclopedia}}
It was a mutated version of the plant which had been engineered by [[Salim]], one of [[Pardot Kynes/DE|Kynes]]'s first [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] students. 

It was tested in the Station facilities, and had shown the ability to survive on only basic nutrients, airborne moisture, and a minimum of supplementary watering. 

Poverty grass was planted in 12 planting zones, along the downwind sides of old dunes, where it stabilized the sand against the prevailing westerly winds. Each stabilized area accumulated a higher windward crest after each sandstorm, which would in turn be planted with poverty grass, until ''[[sif]]''s (barrier dunes of more than 1,500 meters' height) were produced. In all but 4 of the test zones — in which the grass refused to take root — three barrier dunes were ready in a matter of months.<ref>Ecological transformation of Arrakis</ref>

Whistling language
{{Original}}

The '''whistling language''' was a complex and covert method of communicating, via a series of differently pitched and paced whistles. It was used primarily by the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]].

The language was famously used by the [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Bijaz]] to gain subliminal control of [[Hayt]], the first of the [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho gholas]].

Deep desert
{{Original}}

[[File:Dune-final-dunes-1.png|thumb]]

The '''Deep Desert''' was the name used by many, including the [[Fremen]], to describe the vast and most inhospitable deserts on [[Arrakis]].

It was a broad term that mainly included the collective deserts close to or on the equator of the planet. However, it was also used to describe deserts closer to the inhabited polar regions.

The deep desert was typically the abode of the largest and most ferocious [[sandworm]]s, and a location avoided by all humans except for the wild Fremen.

Suk Doctor
{{Original}}

[[File:DuneWorld.Yueh.web.jpg|thumb|Dr Yueh - Illustration by John Schoenherr]]

'''Suk Doctors''' or graduates of the Suk School were the pre-eminent physicians of the Known Universe. They were highly valued for their advanced knowledge and for the mental [[Imperial Conditioning|conditioning]] which supposedly prevented any betrayal of patients or the possibility of taking human life. Since it would appear that Suk doctors were only ever in the employ of wealthy families and organisations, it could be assumed that their services came at a high price. Moreover, their conditioning against taking human life was of particular importance for [[House|Great Houses]] and other high-profile organisations, as there would supposedly be no chance of Suk doctors ever being used as assassins.

The Suk School was one of the many institutions that arose out of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. It was a way for humanity to maximise its potential to learn of its own physiology, and ways in which to cure its ailments.

== Appearance ==
Suk doctors had a diamond tattoo on their forehead, which was meant to be a symbol of their conditioning. The tattoo was generally black; however, Suk doctors returning from [[The Scattering]] sported an orange tattoo. They would also at times have long hair, tied at the back with a metal ring.

== Etymology ==
Historical texts use the word ''suk'' as meaning "marketplace," offering one possible explanation for the doctors' name, which is supported by their almost mercenary nature. However, this connection was never made explicit in the historical texts.

== Notable Suk Doctors ==

*[[Wellington Yueh]], who served [[House Atreides]] until he betrayed and delivered them to [[House Harkonnen]] in [[10,191]]AG.
*[[Solitz]], who served the [[Honored Matres]] on [[Gammu]]

Spice orgy
{{Original}}

[[File:Spiceorgy.png|thumb]]

A '''Spice orgy''' is the culmination of the [[Fremen]] [[Water of Life]] ritual. Once a [[Reverend Mother]] has converted the water from its poisonous state, the Fremen then drink of the changed water, which has narcotic properties.

Their inhibitions are lowered, some of their latent prescient and telepathic abilities come to the forefront, and the Fremen receive release from some of their pent-up emotions. Often wild dancing occurs, as well as sexual activity.

One of these occurred involving the Lady Jessica when she became the new Reverend Mother for the Fremen after she and Paul-Muad'Dib joined the group. Mother Ramallo who had served before Lady Jessica was too old in physical form to journey with the Fremen as they retreated to a new sietch and so passed on the water of life, Kan, on to Jessica who was with child at the time. Jessica then passes the converted drug on to Paul and the rest of the tribe which prompts a much heightened prescience in Paul.

Sandworm
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{FeaturedArticle}}
:''This article is about the creature, Sandworm. For information on the novel ''Sandworms of Dune'', see [[Sandworms of Dune (novel)]].''
[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|A sandworm of Arrakis.]]
The '''sandworm''' was an autotrophic animal that inhabited the planet [[Arrakis]]. Where they originated is unknown, but were introduced to Arrakis before the events of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. It lived in the vast deserts and sand dunes that stretched across the surface of the planet. Most importantly, sandworms are an essential factor in the creation of the [[Spice Melange]].

Sandworms lived beneath the sand. Attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations. This was an effort to defend their territory, of which they were highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, was extremely rare, save for the mysterious [[fremen]], who had achieved some kind of mastery over the beast.

== Physical Characteristics ==
The Sandworm was the predominant lifeform on Arrakis, both honored and feared; vital and deadly. [[File:Dune-sandworm.jpg|thumb|276px|Art by Nathan Rosario]]The sandworms were extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sensed each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats.

===Size===
By anyone's standards, Sandworms could grow to an enormous size. Dr. Yueh cited that specimens "up to 450 meters long" were spotted by observers in the [[deep desert]]. To make a comparison, the largest animal of Earth was believed to be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale Blue whale] measuring in at only 33 meters, or about 7% of a large sandworm's length.

Many things commonly associated with [[Arrakis]] are surrounded in myth and mystery, and the sandworms are no exception. Some people believe that worms from 700 to even 1000 meters existed in the southern pole regions, but this could not be confirmed. See [[Paul Atreides]] during his trial of the [[sandrider]] for further reading regarding their maximum observed size.

<br />

===Age===
Due to the difficulty of studying these creatures, not much was originally known about the wild sandworms. The longevity of the sandworm was supposedly extreme, estimated in the thousands of years.

===Appearance===
[[File:Hr-giger-dune-worm-xii.jpg|thumb|Sandworm as envisioned by H.R. Giger]]
[[File:Big-sketch4.jpg|thumb|[[Dune 2000]] concept art]]
Their skin was thick, rough, and orange colored. It served the simple function of armor and was comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size. These scales overlapped and interlocked to form the armor that protected it against internal sand invasion.

As the [[Fremen]] discovered, this armor, while all but impenetrable, could be exploited. By prying open the edges of one or more of the scales, the integrity of the armor would be compromised; sand was now free to enter into the sandworms softer insides. This would cause intense irritation for the sandworm. The beast would then roll itself until the prone scale was at the highest point from the desert floor, thus minimizing the amount of sand that could enter.

A fremen poised to "ride" the beast as it rolled its open scale towards its highest point could literally mount the worm. As long as the scales remained open, the sandworm would not submerge. [[Maker hooks]] were then placed towards the front of the beast to control lateral movement. As a result, [[wormriding]] became a viable, even sacred, method of transport for the Fremen across the surface of the planet. Indeed, distances were even measured in "sandworms", the distance one could ride a worm until it was exhausted and allowed to submerge. A 20-worm ride would be a far and difficult journey.

A sandworm's internal workings resembled that of a massive blast furnace, producing intense heat and flames. This in turn provided the environmental link of supplying oxygen to the nearly plantless Arrakis. The mouth was positioned at the forward end of the creature and could easily consume gigantic objects such as [[spice harvesters]].

===Smell===
The smell of the sandworm has been particularly documented. A strong, flinty, cinnamon smell exuded from the beast, especially from the mouth. Some said it could be smelled before seen. The presence of the [[spice melange]] was intense and so was its odor.

===Lightning===
[[File:ShaiHulud.jpg|thumb|400px|Painting of Oldman]]

The approach of a sandworm towards its breach-point was often indicated by the dry lightning that frequently occurred in the area; a result of static electricity being discharged into positively-charged air.

===Diet===
The main component of the sandworm's diet was sand, and other inorganic and dry components of the Arrakis crust. It is also believed they sifted the sand-plankton for nourishment.

==Water Poisoning==
Water was fatal to a sandworm, even in small doses. Water that entered a sandworm's body would act as catalyst to accelerate its metabolism to the point that it became unstable and its vital biological functions failed. This was a violent and presumably painful death for the sandworm. It was occasionally necessary however, since the byproduct of the sandworm/water mixture was the highly toxic poison called the [[Water of Life]], which the [[reverend mothers]] used on various occasions.

== Creation of Sandworms ==
The process of sandworm creation began when [[sandtrout]] banded together after converging on a store of water deep beneath the surface of [[Arrakis]]. Indeed, water did occur naturally on Arrakis. However, due to the aforementioned process, it was always destroyed. The [[sandtrout]]/water mixture was then converted into a liquid chemical that the sandworm was capable of digesting without being poisoned. On a side note, this chemical could erupt up to the desert's surface in a violent explosion called a [[pre-spice mass]].

The [[sandtrout]] that survived this event would then coalesce and complete the metamorphosis into a young sandworm.

== Cultural Impact of the Sandworm ==
[[File:Dune Chronicles of the Imperium RPG front cover (art by Mark Zug).png|thumb]]
Insofar as the sandworm was essential to the creation of the [[spice melange]], on a macro scale the sandworm had an enormous impact on humanity.

To the planet's [[Fremen]] population, the creature was a spiritual symbol of their faith and saw them as physical embodiments of the One God of their original [[Zensunni]] religion. Within [[Fremen]] culture the sandworm had several additional names, notably [[The Maker]] and [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously meant ''Old Man of the Desert'', ''Old Father Eternity'', or ''Grandfather of the Desert''

Young sandworms were used by the Fremen for special ceremonies. Inducting new [[Sayyadina]]s or [[Reverend Mother|reverend mothers]] was a prime example of the sandworms essential cultural role.

===Decline of the Sandworm ===
After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the [[Zensunni]] religion across the [[known universe]], the reverence paid to the sandworm spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II]], due to the fact that he had become something of a hybrid, both man and worm.

The terraforming of [[Arrakis]] posed a grave risk to the sandworm, which found life outside the arid desert fatal. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the sandworm once again thrive on Arrakis for approximately another 1500 years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during [[the Scattering]]. This exercise yielded questionable success.

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on [[Arrakis]], including, it was believed, the remaining sandworms. However, this was not before [[Miles Teg]] and [[Darwi Odrade]] had managed to capture a sandworm. Held in an artificial environment on [[Chapterhouse]], the secret and temporary base of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood, this worm would have been the key to re-seeding its population.

===On Chapterhouse===
The first place that Odrade's sandworms began a new [[spice cycle]] was on the [[Bene Gesserit]] homeworld of [[Chapterhouse]]. After their introduction, the [[sand trout]] began to turn the once-lush world into a desert.

== Conception ==
Author Frank Herbert conceived the sandworms based on dragon mythology, particularly fictitious dragons that guard some sort of treasure, such as the creature in ''Beowulf'' and the Dragon of Colchis from the greek myth of Jason. The sandworms of Arrakis will attack humans who attempt to harvest the Spice, as if guarding it (even though the Spice is of no interest for these creatures, since it is waste matter). The sandworms are referred to as "the dragons on the floor of the desert" in ''Children of Dune''. 

Illustrator John Schoenherr gave the sandworm three triangular lobes that form the lips of its mouth. They are also depicted as colossal lampreys or leeches (lacking the three mouth as descripted), as well as terrestrial annelids. 

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
In the 1984 film, the sandworms were portrayed as having the three triagular lobes from their lips. In addition, they were also capable of devouring humans, as can be inferred by Vladimir Harkonnen's ultimate fate in said film courtesy of Alia. For the 2021 adaptation, director Denis Villeneuve spent a year designing the look of the sandworms to make them look "possible" and "prehistoric enough", working "from the texture of the skin, to the way the mouth opens, to the system to eat its food in the sand". Their teeth are more spike in shape, in comparison to previous live-action iterations.

Crysknife
{{Original}}
[[File:Crysknife (art by Matt Howarth, The Dune Encyclopedia).png|thumb|Crysknife illustration in ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'']]
[[File:Crysknife.jpg|thumb|Fan art recreation of a crysknife]]

A '''crysknife''' was a [[knife]] whose blade was made from the tooth of a dead [[sandworm]] of [[Arrakis]]. It was the weapon of choice for the [[Fremen]], the natives of Arrakis.  It was a curved and double-edged like a [[kindjal]], and 20 centimeters long, milky white in color and iridescent, and had a black handle with deep finger ridges separated from the blade by a slim round ring instead of a shearing-guard. The tip of a crysknife was also commonly poisoned, with an unnamed poison residing where the nerve of the tooth used to be. This poison is quick-acting and powerful as shown with the killing of the [[Laza tiger]]s by [[Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].

Crysknives usually came in two forms:
* '''Unfixed:''' [[Knives]] where the [[blade]] would disintegrate unless they were kept close to a human body's electrical field,
* '''Fixed:''' Knives that had been treated so that they would not disintegrate, and could be put into storage.

To the Fremen, the crysknife was sacred, and they maintained much tradition around it. If it was drawn, it could not be resheathed until it had drawn blood. Moreover, the blade was not allowed to be seen by those considered to be outsiders by the tribe; otherwise they would have to die by it, or be "cleansed" in an elaborate ritual.

The sharpness of a crysknife was unparalleled. It was usually perceived to glow with a faint light. They averaged 20 cm in length.

Blades were considered a necessity on Arrakis. This was because neither [[Energy shield|shields]] nor [[Lasgun]]s could be used in the Arrakis desert, due to the Holtzman field attracting sandworms.

Neither knife used in the movie's (1984 or 2021) looked the way described in the books. The 1984 version resembled a large trailing-point knife, while the 2021 movie knife resembled a yatagan.

==Behind the scenes==

In ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]'' "fixing a crysknife" is explained as "keyed to the body of the owner so it would dissolve upon his death" which contradicts the above definition.

==Trivia==
*The "crys-" part of the term might be a reference to the crystallic structures of a sandworm's "tooth". These are not like the typical teeth of vertebrates, and are more comparable to a single strand of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen baleen structures] in the mouth of a filter-feeding baleen whale. Like the baleen strands, they are keratinous, horn-like in origin, rather than a true bony structure.
*A similarly named real bladed weapon is the assymetrical ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris kris]'' dagger of Javanese origin, historically used mainly by Malay people in modern day Indonesia and Malaysia, and more rarely in other parts of southeast Asia. Aside from the vague similarity of the name, it is an entirely different style of fighting knife compared to the fictional Fremen crysknife. It's unclear whether Frank Herbert invented the fictional name as something of an in-joke nod to the historical dagger, or if it's just a coincidence.
*The computer game ''Spelunky'' references the Crysknife by adding it as a ingame powerup, found in the Worm level, the worm's design being a reference to ''Dune'' as well.

Pundi rice
{{Original}}

[[File:51YxFTq7eSL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Pundi Ricefields on Caladan -Dune CCG]]

'''Pundi rice''' is a type of edible grain that was grown and cultivated by [[House Atreides]] while they ruled the planet [[Caladan]]. They grew in the lowland marshes on the southern continent.<ref>''[[Dune: House Atreides]]''</ref>

A typical pundi rice grain was approximately 4cm long.

Pundi rice was part of the Caladani staple diet, as well as an export that generated huge profits for Caladani farmers, as well as the Atreides family, who also owned and cultivated farmland on the planet.

Upon the change of [[fief]] from Caladan to [[Arrakis]] in [[10191 AG]], House Atreides took with them an amount of pundi rice for their meals, as was [[pongi rice]], another grain cultivated on Caladan.

'''III Delta Kaising''' was one of only two planets in the entire [[Known Universe]] where [[shigawire]] was grown. The other planet was [[Salusa Secundus]].

==Name's Analysis==
The Star System's name is probably related to a constellation called (apparently in Chinese) "Kai Sing". There is a Kien Sing, an asterism in Sagittarius.

The '''Butlerian Jihad''', also known as the '''Great Revolt''' as well as commonly shortened to '''the Jihad''', was the crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots that begun in [[201 BG]] and concluded in [[108 BG]].<ref name=":0">''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''</ref> 

== History ==
After two generations of chaos led by the Butlerians, the god of machine-logic was overthrown by the masses and a new concept was raised: "Man may not be replaced." After two generations of violence, humanity took pause. Following this, their gods and rituals were looked upon in a different, perhaps even jaded, light. Both were largely seen to be guilty of using fear as a means of control. Hesitantly, the leaders of religions whose followers had spilled the blood of billions began meeting to exchange views. It was a move encouraged by the embyro [[Spacing Guild]], which was beginning to build its monopoly over all interstellar travel, and by the Bene Gesserit, who were banding the 'sorceresses'.<ref name=":0" />
===Legacy===
By 108 BG, the Jihad itself had finished with the complete destruction of all intelligent machines that were originally built by humans throughout the worlds, but it proved to have many profound impacts on the socio-political and technological development of humanity throughout the new empires that emerged, including a large technological reversal of the entire human civilization. The Butlerians who had begun the Jihad left armies in their wake.

The most dramatic long-lasting result was the ensuing commandment from the [[Orange Catholic Bible]] held sway to humans against the creation of machines which bore the human mind's exact image: ''Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind'', after the destruction of the man-made intelligent machines throughout the human worlds. Even the simplest computers and calculators were banned, with the penalty for building or owning such a thinking machine technology being put to trial and sentenced to immediate death.

This lack of thinking technology created a severe gap in humanity's quality of life, revolving around a need for humans to perform complex logical computations and calculations. This gap led to the creation of the [[mentat]] order (which would be later outlawed by [[Leto Atreides II]] in an attempt to realize [[the Golden Path]] strategy), the [[Bene Gesserit]], and the [[Spacing Guild]]. Non-thinking machines, however, were still utilized. As centuries passed, two fringe worlds, [[Ix]] and [[Tleilax]], brought technological heights of the [[Ixian]]s and the [[Bene Tleilax]]. [[Ixian]]s specialized in the creation of non-thinking mechanical devices; while biological technology was provided by the [[Tleilax]] to replace the mechanical thinking technology used prior to the Jihad.

Aside from the long-lasting effects of the Jihad, the belief in the spiritual divinity of humankind was renewed and strengthened as a component of the Jihad, specifically in contrast to the "evil [[Thinking Machines|thinking machines]]".

The last major impact of the Jihad was the rise of a [[faufreluches|new system]], a feudal-arranged galactic order that lasted for several thousand more years under the rule of [[House Corrino]] before [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] and the rise of [[God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]]. This order, known as the [[Corrino Empire]], was comprised of several new and powerful groups, including the [[Spacing Guild]], the [[Bene Gesserit]], [[CHOAM]], the [[Landsraad]], and the [[House#Known Houses|Great Houses]].

=== Possible revival ===
Toward the end of the reign of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], there was talk on [[Parella]] and the planets of [[Dan]] about another Butlerian Jihad. These "empty dreams", as Leto called them, never came to pass.<ref>''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''</ref>

==Behind the Scenes==
In literature, the Butlerian Jihad is a useful plot device for Frank Herbert. By creating a universe which has rejected conscious machines and has reversed into a quasi-feudal organization, Herbert can focus on social and philosophical issues, rather than the technological issues. Consequently Herbert uses the Dune saga to comment about the human condition and makes direct and accurate parallels to current socio-political realities. The Jihad also provides a reason why we never see computers, calculators, and all forms of "thinking machine" in the original Dune novels by Frank Herbert.

The name could very easily be a literary allusion to Samuel Butler, whose 1872 novel ''Erewhon'' depicted a people who had destroyed machines for fear they would be out-evolved by them.

From ''Erewhon'', Chapter 9,

: ''"... about four hundred years previously, the state of mechanical knowledge was far beyond our own, and was advancing with prodigious rapidity, until one of the most learned professors of hypothetics wrote an extraordinary book (from which I propose to give extracts later on), proving that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life. So convincing was his reasoning, or unreasoning, to this effect, that he carried the country with him and they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years (which period was arrived at after a series of compromises), and strictly forbade all further improvements and inventions"''

Another, more subtle justification for the Butlerian Jihad is also found in Frank Herbert's original novels, specifically Heidegger's thesis that the use of technology trains humans to think like machines. The problem is that machines are deterministic; thus, training people to be machines is self-limiting. Herbert seemed to think that to be human is to be essentially 'open-ended', capable of undiscovered, indeterminate evolution, both personally and as a species.

None of the screen adaptations directly reference the Butlerian Jihad, though the TV Prologue for the [[Dune (film)|1984 film]] renames it to the Great Revolt and places it 4,050 years before the events of the film.

Alma Mavis Taraza
{{Original}}

[[File:Img164.jpg|thumb|Taraza - Illustration by Klaus D.Schiemann]]
{{Quote|We can always trust on the Atreides Genes|Mother Superior Alma Mavis Taraza}}
'''Alma Mavis Taraza''' was the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Mother Superior]] approximately 1500 years after the death of [[Leto Atreides II]]. She was in control of the Bene Gesserit when the [[Rakian Priesthood]] discovered that a village girl named [[Sheeana]] could command the [[sandworm]]s. Upon discovering this, Taraza ordered [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]] to take the girl under her wing and train her as a Bene Gesserit.

Taraza was a close friend to Odrade at the Bene Gesserit School, and both girls developed a strong friendship, using the nicknames of Dar (of Darwi) and ''Tar ''(of Taraza). Later, when Taraza become a [[Reverend Mother]] and a Bene Gesserit breeding mistress, she was chosen because of her beauty to the most difficult lovers, whose genetic material was ambitioned by the Sisterhood.

As Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit, Taraza realized the menace represented by the [[Lost Ones]] that came from [[the Scattering]], especially of the brutal and warlike [[Honored Matres]], whom she analyzed with the help of Odrade. She also purchased many [[gholas]] of [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho]] (twelve of them) from the [[Bene Tleilax]], most of whom were killed before recovering their memories. For the safety of the twelfth ghola of Duncan Idaho, she went to [[Lernaeus]] and asked the help of the Old Bene Gesserit [[Supreme Bashar]] [[Miles Teg]], whose almost identical appearance to Duke [[Leto Atreides]] was important in order to help the ghola recovering his past memories as soon as possible. She also entrusted the Bene Gesserit Imprinter [[Lucilla]] to gain the loyalty of the young Duncan for the Sisterhood.

Many Bene Gesserit sisters, headed by Reverend Mother [[Schwangyu]], declared their open hostility towards Taraza's ghola project. Schwangyu, the commander of the Sisterhood's Keep at [[Gammu]], tried to win Lucilla to her side. However, the young Lucilla had already received warnings from Taraza concerning Schwangyu's policy, and she refused her proposals.

Taraza decided to investigate more about the mysterious Honored Matres and their talents. For that reason she let her ship be captured by an [[Honored Matres]]s male commander, who transported her and her crew directly to the orbit of Gammu, where the young Idaho ghola was being trained under Bashar Teg's guidance. She was rescued with her companions by the clever Teg, who threatened the Honored Matres' male commander of destroying the [[Heighliner]] the no-ships he had on Gammu's orbit. Among Taraza's crew was Reverend Mother Odrade, who was on her way to Rakis, in order to train the young Sheeana and to take the opportunity to reveal to Miles Teg that she was his natural daughter.

Taraza had an interview with [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff]], and, with the help of Odrade, made an alliance with the [[Bene Tleilax]] in order to defend themselves against the [[Return of the Honored Matres|threat of the Honored Matres]].

When the Honored Matres landed on [[Dune (planet)|Dune]] and began attacking both the Bene Gesserit sisters on the Planet and the guardians of the [[Rakian Priesthood]], Taraza was injured by [[Lasgun]] shots fired by the Honored Matres. The Mother Superior realized that her end was near, and it was then that Darwi Odrade reached the place where Taraza laid dying, and [[Other Memory|shared minds with]] her. In that way, Taraza's memories were preserved in Odrade's [[other memory]], and she died on Rakis. At the end, the Honored Matres used their [[Weapon, the|Weapon]] to destroy the Desert Planet, killing Miles Teg and his veterans, as well as disintegrating Taraza's body.

'''Edric''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Guild Navigator|Navigator]] in the [[Spacing Guild]], and a conspirator in a failed plot to kill [[Paul Atreides]] and end the young [[Atreides Empire]].

== Biography ==
Due to his relative power within the Guild, and his ability to elude Paul's [[prescience]] abilities, Edric was a principle conspirator. However, the group's plot was discovered and revealed to Paul by his [[Fremen]] friend and faithful follower [[Otheym]]. After Paul was blinded by a [[stone burner]] and disappeared into the desert, Edric was killed by [[Stilgar]], along with all the participants of the Conspiracy orchestrated by the [[Bene Gesserit]] (lead by [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]]), the [[Bene Tleilax]] (headed by [[Scytale]]), the [[Spacing Guild]] (headed by [[Edric]] himself), [[Fremen]] detractors (headed by [[Korba]]) and [[Princess Consort]] [[Irulan Corrino]].

Even after his execution, Edric's lineage survived for many years, even after the [[Famine Times]] and the [[Scattering]]. The Jewish [[Rabbi]] who gave sanctuary to the fugitive [[Reverend Mother]] [[Lucilla]] informed her that the Honored Matres had under their command a Navigator who was ''"one of the Edrics"''. Later, the Guild Navigator [[Edrik]] claimed in presence of the [[Mother Commander]] [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]] that among his ancestors was the Edric who engaged negotiations with Emperor Paul Muad'dib.

== Behind the scenes ==

* In the 1984 [[David Lynch]] film [[Dune (1984 movie)|Dune]] Edric was classified as a Class 3 Navigator and had a small but vital role in the film. He visited Emperor Shaddam IV in the beginning of the film and asked information about the plot against House Atreides. After Shaddam explains it, Edric adds a detail: Paul Atreides must be killed. He leaves after that, leaving a confused Shaddam and Reverend Mother Mohiam behind(Mohiam subsequently goes to Caladan). Later in the movie, Edric is seen to be the Guild Navigator who takes House Atreides to Arrakis.
* In the Sci-Fi miniseries ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'', Terrence Stone voiced the [[Guild Navigator]] Edric. On the miniseries, Edric appears as the ambassador of the [[Spacing Guild]], offers the [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]] as a gift to [[Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]], and tries to intervene in favor of [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam|Mohiam]]'s fate, but his claims are rejected by [[Alia Atreides|Alia]]. Later, he's executed by [[Fremen]] soldiers who make a hole on his chamber with a hammer, and thus the spice leaves the Navigator's chamber, killing him.
* In the Sci-Fi Miniseries Dune, a Guild Navigator, possibly Edric, is seen taking House Atreides to Arrakis though he appears completely different from the Edric in the sequel. In this version, he has hair, a green face, blue eyes, giant wings and a skeleton underneath.

Gaius Helen Mohiam

'''Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]]. Mohiam trained the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] in the Bene Gesserit chapterhouse on [[Wallach IX]]. Two decades later, Mohiam had become the Truthsayer to Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV and tested the young [[Paul Atreides]] before his departure for [[Arrakis]] with the [[gom jabbar]]. The test was to discover whether Paul was "truly human" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.

Mohiam travelled to Arrakis with the Emperor Shaddam during the last year of the Desert War two years later, in which Paul was the religious leader "Muad'Dib" of the Fremen. After the Battle of Arrakeen, she was involved in the final confrontation. She recognized to Jessica that Paul was indeed the Kwisatz Haderach, but was both angry at him and terrified of him.

Mohiam joined the conspiracy to topple the rule of Paul Atreides after he ascended the [[Golden Lion Throne]] and unleashed his [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|Jihad]] upon the Empire. She, along with [[Scytale]] (a [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Face Dancers|Face Dancer]]), [[Edric]] (a [[Guild Navigator]]), and [[Irulan Corrino]] (embittered wife of Paul Atreides), plotted to insinuate, as the Emperor's Reverend Mother, the Tleilaxu ghola [[Hayt]] into the court to weaken Paul's confidence in his [[prescience]] and thereby ruin him. When the plot failed, she was executed in the retaliation initiated by [[Alia Atreides]] after Paul walked into the desert after the death of [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], ignoring Paul's instructions that Mohiam be spared.

==Behind the Scenes==

Reverend Mother Mohiam was played by [[wikipedia:Siân Phillips|Siân Phillips]] in David Lynch's [[Dune (1984 film)|adaptation]] and Zuzana Geislerová in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 miniseries]] and its sequel [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|''Children of Dune'']]. Charlotte Rampling portrays her in Denis Villenueve's [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 movie]] and was interested in portraying [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] in [[Dune (unreleased film)|Alejandro Jodorowski's production]]. She eventually turned the role down due to a scene that involved 2,000 extras defecating at once.

The prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] reveal that Mohiam was secretly the mother of Jessica and grandmother of Paul. The lineage occurred as a result of a vicious rape by the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Harkonnen]], although she had already been commanded by the Sisterhood to become pregnant with the Baron's daughter for their breeding program. In revenge for the attack, she gave the Baron a degenerative disease that he covered up through his gluttony. According to Herbert and Anderson, this twist was discovered in notes left behind by Frank Herbert.

A '''Steersman''' was another name for [[Guild Navigator]]s of  the [[Spacing Guild]]. They are deformed because of the deep exposure to [[Spice Melange]] and the zero-gravity life in space. The high exposure to spice is necessary to develop the linear prescience to guide the spaceship through the safest path during the folding space.

The concept was further fleshed out in that advanced Navigators were steersmen, and that Navigators with far less experience were called [[pilot]]s.

Honored Matres
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Chapterhousedune-2.jpg|thumb|Dune Chapterhouse book cover]]

The '''Honored Matres''' were a powerful all-female group who emerged from uncharted space to become [[War of the Sisterhoods|formidable rivals]] and a sinister reflection of the [[Bene Gesserit]], some two thousand years after the death of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]].

== History ==
=== Origins ===
During the departure of countless people during [[Scattering|the Scattering]], the [[Bene Gesserit]] sent out many exploration and colonization teams from within their own ranks. Nothing was heard of the groups again. However, it was later discovered that some did survive, and indeed thrived in numbers and power. However, the experiences of this group, and their interactions with other groups from The Scattering, triggered fundamental changes in their beliefs, customs and objectives.

According to the evidence of [[Reverend Mother]] [[Bellonda]], the Honored Matres were formed in the Scattering by the Sisterhood's Reverend Mothers who had been sent out in these groups and the [[Fish Speaker|Fish Speakers]] that used to serve Leto II in extremis. 

=== Return to the Old Empire ===
The Matres eventually fled back into the [[Atreides Empire|Old Atreides Empire]] from the [[Ones of Many Faces|Enemies of Many Faces]] who hunted them. Around ten years into their flight from the Enemies, they established base on [[Gammu]]. After two years on Gammu, the Matres were taking over control of an increasing number of planets. In the meantime the loose economic federation kept together by CHOAM slowly fell apart as a side effect. 

=== War with the Bene Gesserit ===
After thirty years on Gammu, the Honored Matres attacked the Bene Gesserit Keep there in an attempt on the life of a [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola who was designed by the Bene Tleilax as a weapon against them, initating [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|a war between the two Sisterhoods]]. Meanwhile, the Matres attempted to kill [[Mother Superior]] [[Alma Mavis Taraza]] and [[Bashar]] [[Miles Teg]], but failed. During the following period, one of their number, [[Murbella]], joined the Bene Gesserit. 

The Matres ultimately attacked the planet of [[Arrakis|Rakis]] using [[Weapon, the|the Weapon]] (which they had stolen from the Ones of Many Faces), killing Taraza. Miles Teg led his troops out on [[Battle of Rakis|a last suicidal defense of Rakis]], designed to attract the rage of the Matres. They decided to destroy the planet and the sandworms.

== Customs and Ideologies ==
While some [[Bene Gesserit]] ideologies remained a part of the Honored Matre identity, they incorporated outside customs and philosophies that made them very distinct from &ndash; and often at odds with &ndash; their ancestral origins. Key to these was their general opinion of control. While the [[Bene Gesserit]] used subtle and often-deceptive methods to retain their power base within an existing balance of power, the Honored Matres sought to supersede the ''status quo'' and gain absolute control over all other groups.

This aggressive strategy required the enslavement or destruction of all other power brokers, and consequently demanded the group possess powerful control mechanisms. The most effective method used by the Honored Matres to infiltrate and overwhelm other groups was a form of "sexual enslavement." During their evolution in uncharted space, the Honored Matres perfected sexual intercourse into a narcotic process.

By using carefully crafted skills, an Honored Matre practitioner learned how to coerce an outsider &ndash; typically of the male gender &ndash; into total subservience. This action, performed often, and upon the right individuals, allowed them to conquer many other groups in uncharted space, and build a formidable military and resource base.

The Honored Matres hungered for intimidation and violence, a trait that encompassed their entire culture. Evidence of this was visible in their frequent use of assassination to gain power.

Leadership of the Honored Matres was executed via the absolute control of one member, who typically rose to the top by killing the previous leader and any other colleagues who got in her way. This method was the established rite of ascension. Thus, the title of "leader" changed frequently, and loyalty between Honored Matres was conditional at best.

Seeking [[Bene Gesserit]] skills such as cellular-control, which would render the [[Omnius Scourge|Scourge]] powerless, the Matres continued on in violence, and destroyed planets and civilizations with their stolen [[Weapon, the|Weapons]]. The Matres returned to the core of the [[Old Empire]], during the leadership of Bene Gesserit Mother Superior [[Alma Mavis Taraza]]. They wrought havoc in an attempt to instill fear and gain absolute power over all. After conquering many planets, they made [[Junction]] their capitol in their war of conquest.

Though most groups of the Old Empire were conquered or infiltrated (including the [[Bene Tleilax]]), the [[Bene Gesserit]] mounted strong resistance, thanks in no small part to their immunity to the Honored Matres' enslavement-skills and the efforts of [[Miles Teg]] and one of the [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho gholas]].

Witch
'''Witch''' was a derogatory title given to the [[Bene Gesserit]] by people who didn't like them. It had to do with their mystical abilities in combat, uncanny knowledge of people and events, and, in the [[expanded universe]], probably their origins as the [[Sorceress]]es.

Daniel
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:240px-Grant_Wood_-_American_Gothic_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb]]
'''Daniel''' was an entity who appeared in the visions of the final incarnation of [[Duncan Idaho]]. The character appeared as a homely elderly man alongside his companion [[Marty|Marty.]] Duncan knew for a [[Mentat]] Projection datum that they were strong enough to drive out [[Honored Matres]], and strongly suspected them to be the [[Ones of Many Faces]] who had forced the Matres to flee back into the [[Atreides Empire|Old Empire]]. He was also certain through a Projection that they had found another way to use [[Holtzman]]'s ancient theories. He suspected, although was not sure, that they were independent [[Face Dancer|Face Dancers]].

When Duncan Idaho fled [[Chapterhouse]] on a no-ship with [[Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh]], [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Tleilaxu Master|Master]] [[Scytale]], [[Miles Teg]], a few [[Bene Gesserit]] and a few [[Judaism|Jews]], Daniel and Marty tried to stop him, attempting to trap the ship in [[Net, the|the Net]]. However, they failed; Daniel knew he saw them but he didn't suspect he saw the Net, and was taken aback by Duncan, who deleted the navigation records of the no-ship in order to escape.

Anderson]], Marty and Daniel are revealed to be representations of ancient [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligences]] [[Erasmus]] and [[Omnius]]. It is unknown whether or not Frank Herbert himself actually ever intended this, given that his final novel implies them to be advanced [[Tleilaxu]] creations.

Face Dancer
{{Original}}
[[File:Facedancer.jpg|thumb|Tleilaxu Face Dancer as depicted in the Computer game Emperor: Battle for Dune]]

A '''Face Dancer''' was a member of a race bred by the [[Bene Tleilax]]. Their standing in Tleilaxu society fell below that of [[Tleilaxu Master]], and their ability to mimic other individuals made them popular for numerous roles, including spies and assassins.

== Physical Attributes ==
Tleilaxu Face Dancers had the ability to take on the physical appearance of other individuals. Their name came from the fact that when they changed shape their faces would appear to 'dance' as the flesh moved.

Despite Face Dancers being neither male nor female, they had the ability to take on the physical sex of the individual they were copying. However, they were incapable of breeding.

== Limitations ==
Face Dancers could generally mimic individuals to an almost perfect level of precision. As a result, the [[Bene Tleilax]] would often use them to infiltrate other organisations and governments. Ideally, the Bene Tleilax could replace almost whomever they wished with a Face Dancer and would often do so, with some of these impostors acting successfully for many years.

However, the use of Face Dancers was not an infallible manoeuvre. There were two significant limitations.

The first limitation was that their pheromones could be detected by a [[Bene Gesserit]] adept. A Bene Gesserit Sister or [[Reverend Mother]] could detect them by a subtle but distinct odor emitted by their pheromones. Indeed, the Bene Tleilax generally were not aware that the Bene Gesserit had this ability and used it to their advantage. As a result, Face Dancers were not as effective as the Tleilaxu had hoped when the Bene Gesserit were involved.

By the time of the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]], the Tleilaxu had developed Face Dancer talents so perfectly that even the Bene Gesserit had difficulty detecting them. These new Face Dancers were also capable (through a touching of foreheads) of acquiring some of the memories of those who had just died, so that when they were copying those dead individuals, they were also able to discover some of their secrets and play their role as impostor even more convincingly.

The second limitation in the use of Face Dancers was that at times, if a Face Dancer had been acting in a certain role for a long time, the Face Dancer would become delusional and start to believe that they were in fact the person they were mimicking. When this happened, they would fall outside Bene Tleilax control and would need to be killed, often exposing the Tleilaxu infiltration in the process. This happened with the [[Rakian Priesthood|Rakian Chief Priest]] [[Hedley Tuek]].

Scytale
{{Or-DE,Ex}}{{Character_infobox|name=Scytale|birth=|death=[[10210 AG]]|title=[[Face Dancer]], [[Tleilaxu Master]], [[Masheikh]]|debut=[[Dune Messiah]]}}

'''Scytale''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Face Dancers|Face Dancer]] of the [[Bene Tleilax]], and later the youngest [[Masheikh]] and the last [[Tleilaxu Master]], who played a prominent role in major historical events that spanned more than five thousand years.

== Biography ==

=== Face Dancer ===
Scytale was originally born as a Tleilaxu Face Dancer during the last decades of the [[Corrino Empire]].

At the end of [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|Muad’Dib’s Jihad]], the Tleilaxu directly participated through Scytale in the plot to destroy the royal family with the gift to [[Paul Atreides|Paul-Muad'DIb Atreides]] of [[Hayt]], the ghola of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], secretly hoping to use Hayt to finally figure out how to restore a ghola's memories rather than using him to kill Paul. 

Scytale was first sent to [[Wallach IX]] as the Tleilaxu representative in the conspiracy, and then to the Imperial capital of  [[Arrakis]], where he killed [[Farok]], his blind [[Farok's son|son]] and their neighbor's daughter [[Lichna]], who he impersonated, coming to the Emperor Muad’Dib as her to arrange his own collection of the secret Tleilaxu Master [[Bijaz|Bijaz,]] who was instrumental in reawakening Hayt’s memories as Duncan by getting him to attempt and fail to kill Paul.

When [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]] died; giving birth to the twins [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], [[Scytale]], seeing how Duncan had been successfully reawakened, revealed to Paul that this had been the plan all along, unleashing his ultimatum: he would kill the newborn children, or Paul could make a deal with the Tleilaxu by giving them Chani’s flesh with which they would make and reawaken a ghola. Scytale was, however, killed by Paul with the help of his newborn son.

=== Rebirth and promotion ===
The Tleilaxu, who had now learned how to renew the flesh and reawaken the memories of a ghola, had now achieved a kind of immortality through gholas, although they cndensed this new power into a single government whose potency was confined lest it be demanded everywhere. Scytale, as the one who had made this new eternal life possible, was the first to be brought back to life, reawakened and promoted to a Tleilaxu Master.

=== Masheikh  ===
By the time of the return [[Honored Matres]] to the Old Empire, Scytale had become the youngest and most junior member of the nine [[Masheikh]]s who made up the Tleilaxu ruling Council. He armed the faithful on the order of the [[Mahai]], [[Tylwyth Waff|Twylyth Waff]], as the Bene Tleilax set out to conquer humanity and convert it to their Great Belief.

Shortly before the Mahai Waff died in the [[Battle of Rakis]] and the Honored Matres destroyed Tleilax and all of the planets of the Bene Tleilax, practically ending Tleilaxu civilisation, Scytale left Bandalong and sought sanctuary on the planet [[Junction]] and sought sanctuary with the Spacing Guild or [[CHOAM]], but was taken aboard a Bene Gesserit spy ship and brought to [[Chapterhouse]].

=== Last Tleilaxu Master ===
On Chapterhouse, Scytale was imprisoned aboard a huge planet-bound [[no-ship]]. He informed the Sisters of how to grow a ghola in an [[Axlotl Tanks|axolotl tank]] but not how to use a tank to make the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. He remained imprisoned on Chapterhouse for a decade.

However, when [[Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana]], the Sisterhood's [[Miles Teg]] ghola, and a Duncan Idaho ghola escaped on the ship he became a willing passenger in their flight into uncharted space. Within his body lay a vial containing genetic samples of numerous individuals, including the Tleilaxu Masters, making it possible for him to recreate his culture, as well as many of the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] line and their servants.

*[[Otheym]] {{C|formerly}}|image=Bijaz-Children-of-Dune-Miniseries.jpg}}

'''Master Bijaz''' [d. [[10210 AG]]] was a [[Tleilaxu Master]] and a [[Prescience|prescient]] dwarf, who was immune to others' prescience. He spoke cryptically in riddles and rhymes.

== Biography ==
Bijaz had lived many previous [[ghola]] lives. He was bought by [[Otheym]] during [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]], who believed that the [[Bene Tleilax]] had "thrown him away", he was given to [[Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]] in [[10209 AG]] as a means of aquiring the names of the conspirators in [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|the plot]] against him. 

He had a hidden purpose: to control the first [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Hayt]]. When the dwarf was confined to the keep, Hayt was ordered to question him, but all of Bijaz's answers were at first as obscure as his usual manner of speaking. During the conversation, Bijaz refused to call the ghola Hayt, insisting that he was Duncan Idaho, and implanted in him the command to kill the Emperor when he was in the depths of grief, using the secret whistling language of the [[Bene Tleilax]]. Duncan also did, however, manage to get from him a full list of the conspirators against Paul.

When Idaho confronted Paul after the death of [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], the trauma restored his pre-ghola memories and he spared Paul. It was, however, revealed that this was in fact only a contingency, and the [[Tleilax]]u were planning to use Idaho as proof of gholas regaining memories, plotting to use Chani's ghola as a bargaining chip. The [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]] bargained with Paul but was killed by him.

After Scytale's death, the plan had still not failed, however. Bijaz escaped his confinement and came to a worn out Paul and Duncan, giving him the same deal once again. Paul refused and ordered Idaho to kill Bijaz to prevent any more temptation. It is possible, however, that his body was returned to [[Tleilax]] and restored to life via axoltl technology, such as occurred with [[Scytale]].

== Relationships ==

=== Duncan Idaho ===
{{Quote|We are like brothers. We grew in the same [[Axlotl tank | tank]]: I first and then you.|Bijaz describes his connection with Duncan while imprisoned in the keep in [[Arrakeen]]|Dune Messiah}}
Duncan first met Bijaz as Hayt, before he regained his original memories. He took an instant dislike to him, mistrusting the dwarf and being wary in his presence and particularly distraught at Bijaz's provocative use of his original name of Duncan Idaho. However, Hayt and Bijaz also had a fundemental connection in that they had been grown in the same Tleilaxu axolotl tank, making Bijaz compare them to brothers.

During Hayt's conversation with Bijaz after their initial meeting, the ghola noted that he radiated a charismatic alertness that made the observor think of ancient idols and threatened to order a guard to strangle him in an attempt to indimiate the dwarf, who also was not fond of Hayt, calling him a callous lout. When Hayt asked what Bijaz planned to do with him, he said that he would do him a simple kindness. Following the reawakening of Duncan's memories in Hayt, Paul ordered him to kill Bijaz before he succumbed to the Tleilaxu plan, and Duncan obeyed without hesitation, saying that he had been the one to do Bijaz the 'kindness.'

=== Paul Atreides ===
{{Quote|You’ve sired, Sire. You are much more than the base [[Usul]]<nowiki>. You’re the [[House Atreides | Atreides </nowiki>[[Padishah Emperor | Emperor]], [[Paul Atreides | Paul Muad'dib]]. And you are my finger.|Bijaz to Paul|Dune Messiah}}

Bijaz clearly did not respect Paul as the Emperor of the Known Universe, at least at first. Bijaz openly talked to Muad'Dib despite addressing him as "Sire" and comparing him to his finger. During their initial encounter, he also mockingly asked, "Usul, that’s the base of the pillar. How can Usul be base when I’m the basest thing living?" 

=== Scytale ===
While the exact relationship between Bijaz and the Face Dancer Scytale is unclear, it is certain that at some point either prior to Otheym's buying or earlier during his ownership in secret they met and conspired for the plan against Emperor Muad'Dib. Despite Bijaz being a Tleilaxu Master and thus originally higher in rank within the hegemony of the Bene Tleilax than Scytale, the latter would later become the youngest ever [[Masheikh]] and thus postthumously outrank the dwarf.

'''Tleilaxu Master''' was a rank in the social system of the [[Bene Tleilax]] are rated above [[Face Dancers|Face Dancer]], with Face Dancers often used as mules to do their bidding. They were known to use a specialized humming or whistling language to control Face Dancers and gholas.

The nine [[Masheikh|Masheikhs]] who governed Bene Tleilax through the Ruling Council were chosen from the Master ranks.

At times, if Face Dancers lived enough serial lives as gholas, they were elevated to Master status. [[Scytale]] was one example of this.

Genetic memory
{{Original}}

[[File:Pic171730-1-1.jpg|thumb]]

'''Genetic memory''' is the concept, present in the original novel, where an individual may possess the memories of their ancestors, hidden away within their genetic code.

== Core concept ==

The idea behind genetic memory is that an individual's experiences would become imprinted upon their cells, and would in turn be hidden within the cells of their descendants. This theory is also used to explain the mystery of benevolent mutation.

While an individual's genetic memory was not normally available to them, exposure to various [[awareness spectrum narcotics]], such as the [[spice melange]], could cause an individual's genetic memory to surface.

== Awareness ==


[[File:9781849830287-1.jpg|thumb]]

Members of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood became exposed to their genetic memories (on the female side only) after their consumption of the [[Water of Life]]. The Bene Gesserit called this [[Other Memory]], and used it as a source of immense knowledge that had otherwise been lost to history. Through their [[breeding program]], the Bene Gesserit hoped that they could one day bear a male who could possess the genetic memories of both female and male ancestors. Such an individual would be called the [[Kwisatz Haderach]].

The [[Bene Tleilax]] used psychological trauma to restore the memories of [[ghola]]s up until and including the time of death of the original individual. This would not be possible were it not for genetic memory.

== Hazards ==

Dangers existed with the possession of genetic memory. A [[Bene Gesserit]] adept could possibly become overpowered by the [[ego-memory]] of one of their ancestors. (This would also more frequently happen with [[pre-born]] children, who had access to their genetic memory since before their birth; their undeveloped psyches were more susceptible to these ego-memories.) Their personality would ultimately become supplanted by that [[ego-memory]], and become possessed by them. This was called [[Abomination]]. Bene Gesserit general policy was that anyone found to be Abomination should be killed, regardless of how benevolent or powerful the ego-memory was considered to be.

Spacing Guild
{{Or-DE,Ex}}{{Organisation_infobox|name=Spacing Guild|headquarters=[[Junction]]|intentions=To serve commerce throughout the Imperium|image=200px-Guild_Small.jpg}}

The '''Spacing Guild''', also called the '''Guild of Navigators''' on rare occassions, was an interstellar shipping and trade conglomerate during the years of the [[Corrino Empire]] and later the [[Atreides Empire]], and one leg of the political tripod maintaining the [[Great Convention]]. The Guild was the second mental-physical training school established after the [[Butlerian Jihad]], the first being the [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]], and the Guild monopoly on space travel and upon international banking was taken as the beginning point of the [[Standard Imperial Calendar|Imperial Calender]].

==History==
===Post-Butlerian Jihad===
After the [[Bene Gesserit]], the Spacing Guild was the second major mental-physical training school established following the [[Butlerian Jihad]] which survived into the [[Corrino Empire]]. It had already begun to build its monopoly over all interstellar travel shortly after the end of the Jihad when the [[Orange Catholic Bible]] was compiled following the leaders of religions meeting to exchange views - a move which had been encouraged by the embryo Guild along with the Bene Gesserit.<ref>''Dune'', Appendix II</ref> The genesis of the Guild's eventual monopoly on space travel, transport and interstellar banking was taken as the beginning point of the Imperial Calendar (1 AG). Details of the Guild's emergence were contentious, although it was believed they emerged as a serious political and economic force around the time of the [[The Great Convention|Great Convention]] in the 1st century AG.

===Corrino Empire===
=====Arrakis Affair=====
In the year 10191 AG, when the Arrakis Affair boiled up, the Guild made overtures to the Bene Gesserit. The Guild hinted that its Navigators were "bothered about the future" or saw "problems on the horizon." Two years later, the Guild lowered its price so that every Great House's army headed to Arrakis with the Emperor Shaddam IV to stop the rebellious Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides. However, Paul threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. They had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul was capable of it – and they sent everyone home, yielding to the control of the man who quickly became the new Emperor. 

While the exact evolution of the Guild's monopoly on faster-than-light [[space travel]] is not given, they do nonetheless wield this formidable power throughout the history of the Corrino Empire, a time known as the Guild Peace. Paul Atreides was the first emperor to check the power of the Guild through control of the spice melange, although they remained a significant political power.

===Impact of the God-Emperor===
New problems for the Spacing Guild were created by the ascendancy of [[Leto Atreides II]] to the title of [[God Emperor]]. [[Leto Atreides II|Leto's]] extremely long lifespan, coupled with his decision to realize [[the Golden Path]] strategy, saw him hoard the [[Spice Melange]] with no concern for short-term problems.

Thus, over the many centuries of his rule, the Spacing Guild was forced to do his bidding and their unique powerbase of old was significantly diminished.

===Post-God-Emperor Role===

While the Spacing Guild remained a powerful body even after the death of [[Leto Atreides II]], their power gradually eroded over time. By the time of the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]] the success of the groups sent out in [[The Scattering|the Scattering]] had created new but largely unknown threats to their hegemony. This was because [[Ixian]] [[no-ships]], which could perform the same functions of a Guild Navigator, were in common use. As a result, the Guild no longer had a monopoly on space travel.

==Structure==

===Hierarchy===


The Spacing Guild was by its very nature a secretive organization that took up functions previously covered by the [[Thinking Machines]], just as [[mentat]]s and the [[Bene Gesserit]] did. Their very existence rests on the proprietary knowledge they had clung to for thousands of years.

The inner structure of the Guild during and after the time of [[Paul Atreides]] was never fully revealed. However, it is known that the role of [[Guild Navigator]] was most prestigious, and the ambition of almost all of those who joined the Guild.

Other known '''Guild''' roles included the Chief [[Administrator]], the administrative staff, Navigator attendants, Guild ambassadors, and technical support staff.  Members of the Guild commonly wear gray uniforms with the Guild's analemma sigil of infinity emblazoned on the sleeves.

===Dependency===

The [[Guild Navigator]]s were utterly dependent on the [[Spice Melange]] to safely deliver a vessel via the [[Holtzman Effect]]. Even a partial restriction on the '''Guild's''' [[Spice Melange|spice]] requirements rendered them powerless, and reduced long distance trade and transport to a snail's pace.

Prior to the discovery of the [[Spice Melange]]'s prescient powers, the use of the [[Spacefolder]] was very dangerous. One in about every eight [[Spacefolder]]s was destroyed during travel, because of the lack of a viable method for avoiding gravitational hazards.

The '''Fremen''' were a sub-culture of [[human]]s descended from the [[Zensunni Wanderers]] who considered the planet [[Arrakis]] their home. They formed an integral part in the establishment of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] launched by [[Paul Atreides]], their adopted leader.

== History  ==
Despite their keen sense of oral history, the history of the Fremen prior to their arrival on [[Arrakis]] was distorted and partially lost over the millennia. They concluded that [[Arrakis]] was the final stop on the migration of the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], a journey that they mistakenly believed started on the planet [[Poritrin]].

In the [[Standard Year]] 10,191 [[A.G.]], Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] ordered [[House Atreides]] to replace their enemies [[House Harkonnen]] in the administration of Arrakis. Upon arrival on Arrakis, House Atreides, lead by Duke [[Leto Atreides I]] sought to befriend the Fremen. However, because of years of harsh Harkonnen rule and dealings with Imperial agents, the Fremen were at first distrustful of the Atreides. After a short while however, the Fremen came to develop a relationship with the Duke through his even-handedness and generosity. Moreover, the Duke sent his [[Warmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]] as an ambassador. Through Duncan's abilities as a warrior the Atreides managed to gain the trust of the Fremen, and the Duke quickly learned that the Fremen were a powerful force with which to align his House. However, when the Harkonnens and Corrinos invaded Arrakis, House Atreides went renegade and sought refuge with the Fremen.
After their adoption of the Duke's son [[Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the Fremen saw a rapid and dramatic change in their fortunes. Upon determining that [[Paul Atreides]] was their [[Mahdi]] - or prophetic savior - they readily followed his leadership and engaged in guerilla warfare against [[Imperium|Imperial]] elements on [[Arrakis]]. The Fremen had developed such formidable fighting abilities through years of surviving both the harsh environment and attrition wars against the Harkonnens that they were deemed superior even to the Corrino [[Sardaukar]] forces. Within a few years they had gone from being perpetually harassed by elements within the [[Corrino Empire]] (most notably [[House Harkonnen]]) to being the foot soldiers of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Paul Atreides]] powerful jihad. In twelve Standard Years the Fremen overran the Imperium.

===Museum Fremen===

[[File:Img149.jpg|thumb|Museum Fremen - Illustration by Klaus D. Schiemann]]

From the time of the [[God-Emperor]] onwards the cultural impact of the Fremen ebbed, thanks in no small part to the terraforming of [[Arrakis]]. By the time of the God Emperor's death, the Fremen were relegated to being no more than 'museum' pieces, their ancient and purposeful traditions diluted into honorary forms without meaning. After [[The Scattering]] and during the time of the [[Honored Matres]], the Fremen possessed little of the distinct identity of their past, although a few individuals, such as [[Sheeana]], continued to adhere to some of the old Fremen attitudes and traditions.

It is believed that most, if not all of the Fremen (excluding Sheanna) were killed during the Honored Matre attack on Rakis that essentially destroyed the planet, approximately 1500 Standard Years after Leto II's death.

== Culture ==
To the Fremen, the fight for survival had long dominated their cultural identity. The brutal environment of [[Arrakis]] necessitated the frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. Additionally, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge. These two aspects saw them emerge as efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of [[Arrakis]] to fend off off-world opponents who often possessed far superior technology and formal training. 

The Fremen typically lived in patriarchal collectives, known as [[sietch]]es, which were led by a [[Naib]]. Each sietch resides within one of the numerous rocky formations that dot the sands of Arrakis. Collectively, all Fremen belonged to the [[Ichwan Bedwine]], or broad brotherhood. Polygamy was commonplace in Fremen society, with more prominent men having several wives and children with each of them. Also integral to their community was their [[Reverend Mother]], who was created after drinking the [[water of life]] and sharing the regurgitated bile with her sietch members.

Water was a central part of Fremen culture. Indeed, for Fremen, water ''was'' life. To conserve against the unnecessary loss of water in the desert, Fremen wore complex full-body filtration systems called [[stillsuit]]s, which reclaimed the body's moisture. Additionally, specialized headgear prevented most of the normal loss through the scalp and forehead via perspiration, while masks and noseplugs reclaimed moisture from the wearers' breathing. Gloves were also available, too, but many Fremen opted instead to rub the juice of the [[creosote bush]] on their hands to inhibit perspiration. With a Fremen stillsuit in proper working order, the wearer lost only about a thimbleful of water per day.

The Fremen rule was that one's water belongs to the tribe. Thus when a Fremen died or was killed in combat, rather than being buried or cremated, he or she was rendered down into water. In the case of ''[[amtal]]'', or ritual combat to the death between two disagreeing Fremen, since they fought without stillsuits, the water of the loser went to the victor to replenish him. What remained was measured and allocated to him, but the water itself was turned over to the watermasters.

== Appearance ==
Due to living on [[Arrakis]], the typical Fremen appeared as a sinewy [[human]] with leathery tanned skin. These effects were less pronounced on those Fremen who live in cities such as [[Arrakeen]]. In addition, Fremen eyes were colored entirely blue ("[[Eyes of Ibad]]"), due to their excessive ingestion of the [[Spice Melange]].

== Religion ==
{{Stub}}{{Religion infobox|name=Fremen religion|headquarters=[[Arrakis]]|theology=Monotheism/Polytheism|deities=*[[Shai-Hulud]]|collapse=Gradually in the years following [[10219 AG]]}}
Religiously, the Fremen were deeply spiritual, to the point of being superstitious. Before the coming of Muad'Dib, the Fremen of Arrakis practiced a religion whose roots in the [[Maometh Saari]] were there for any scholar to see. Many also traced the extensive borrowings from other religions. The most common example was the [[Hymn to Water]], a direct copy from the [[Orange Catholic Liturgical Manual]], calling for rain clouds which Arrakis had never seen. But there were more profound points of accord between the Kitab al-Ibar of the Fremen and the teachings of Bible, Ilm, and Fiqh.

Over the centuries the Fremen had adapted their blend of [[Zensunni]] faith to their desert environment, and adopted the [[sandworm]] of [[Arrakis]] (or [[Shai-Hulud]] as they called it) as a physical manifestation of a [[God]]. This, combined with the sparse natural resources on [[Arrakis]] led to the [[Spice Melange]] becoming an integral part of their diet and culture. As with many traditionalist and mystic [[religion]]s, the faith of the Fremen relied heavily on prophecies. These beliefs were used by some, including the [[Bene Gesserit]] to further their own ends.

== Behind the Scenes ==
Though further details are not chronicled by [[Frank Herbert]], the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] give a detailed explanation of how the Fremen came into being. In these novels they are an amalgamation of at least two separate groups: the Zenshi'a, who came during the rise of the Evermind or possibly during the Time of the Titans, and the Zensunni, who arrived during Butlerian Jihad after events on Poritrin led to the second slave uprising. Both fled to [[Arrakis]] to escape slavery brought on by the harsh reaction of the free humans to the Buddaislamics refusal to fight the thinking machines as they further encroached on humanity.

Placido Salat
{{Original}}


[[File:Placidosalat.jpg|thumb]]

'''Placido Salat''' was a beefy man with prominent cheekbones and a florid face. He was a teaching chef at the [[Bene Gesserit]] complex on [[Chapterhouse]], and was regarded by the Mother Superior [[Darwi Odrade]] to be one of history's greatest chefs, his signature dish being beef placido (low case his choice). As a special treat for Darwi Odrade, Placido would create an oyster stew that reminded Odrade of her youth before being taken away for [[Bene Gesserit Training]].

One of Placido Salat's students was [[Duana]], Darwi Odrade's personal chef.

Reverend Mother
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:51mgnhsvu2L-1.jpg|thumb|Reverend mother illustration from the Dune CCG]]

A '''Reverend Mother''' was a title held by female members of the [[Bene Gesserit]] who had completed training to an advanced level. Typically, Reverend Mothers had three names: The first was a Latin male name, the second an English female name, the third an Arabic or exotic name. Examples of such naming include [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], and [[Alma Mavis Taraza]]. The leader of the Bene Gesserit, the [[Mother Superior|Reverend Mother Superior]], was always chosen from the Reverend Mother ranks.

== Spice Agony ==
After completing many years of intellectual, physical, and psychological training with the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, a prospective Reverend Mother underwent a dangerous ritual that involved a significant amount of [[awareness spectrum narcotics]]. Specifically, the poison used was the [[Water of Life]] - the liquid exhalation of a [[sandworm]] produced at the moment of its death by drowning in regular water.

The drug entered her body as a poison, and it was her task to consciously transform the chemical into a benign substance in a process known as the spice agony. If the subject survived the process, the physical and mental trauma caused by the spice agony would cause their [[Other Memory]] to emerge, that is, she would gain the memories of all her female ancestors, resulting in a sudden and immense accumulation of knowledge and power.

The Water of Life will turn the eyes of a Reverend Mother completely blue, even if she was not addicted to melange prior to her spice agony.

==Mentat Bene Gesserit==
All Bene Gesserit [[Mentat]]s (like [[Tertius Eileen Anteac]] and [[Bellonda]]) were pre-conditioned Reverend Mothers, who, in addition to the standard abilities of a Bene Gesserit, and the unlocked [[Other Memory]] of a Reverend Mother, also possessed the skills of supralogical strategizing, tacticizing, and hypothesizing of a Mentat (skills which surpassed even those of the pre-Butlerian Jihad [[Thinking Machines]]). 

== Male Bene Gesserit ==
Until the rise of [[Paul Atreides]], the [[Water of Life]] ritual had been fatal to every male who had attempted it. In an extensive [[breeding program]], the Bene Gesserit produced a single male who survived the transformation, a male version of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (a 'Reverend Father' of sorts), the so-called [[Kwisatz Haderach]] (who posses the male and female genetic memories as well as total prescience). By the original plan of the Bene Gesserit, the Kwisatz Haderach would have been born from the union of a son of [[House Harkonnen]] and a daughter of [[House Atreides]]. Paul Atreides was the final, albeit unexpected, result of this strategy. 

[[Miles Teg]] was also a product of the Bene Gesserit [[breeding program]], down the line of the [[House Atreides]] genes, and (though his mother, Reverend Mother [[Janet Roxbrough]]) received much of the Bene Gesserit learning instilled in Reverend Mothers, as part of his training to eventually become the [[Supreme Bashar]] of the Sisterhood. Therefore, while not a Kwisatz Haderach, Miles, like Paul Atreides, was both a [[Mentat]] and a Bene Gesserit adept.

[[Farad'n Corrino]], while never an official Bene Gesserit adept, was briefly trained in the Sisterhood's ways by the Reverend Mother [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]]. 

<u>
Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam to Lady Jessica Atreides</u>

: ''"You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?''

: ''... Desires don't figure in this! An Atreides daughter''

: ''could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach.''

: ''We may lose both blood lines now."''

== Wild Reverend Mothers ==
===Sayyadinas===
Unbeknown to many in the [[Imperium]], some fringe cultures produced wild Reverend Mothers who possessed many of the skills of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, but without the official training. It should be noted that even these "wild" Reverend Mothers ultimately owed their status to the Bene Gesserit anyway, with most of them owing their positions to the religious engineering orchestrated by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]].

Such groups included the [[Fremen]], who had their own independent tradition that emerged from the Missionaria. Such individuals were called [[Sayyadina]]. These Sayyadina went through the spice agony and had access to their ancestral female memories; however, they lacked the other skills (such as the [[Weirding Way]]) that the Bene Gesserit had developed.

===Other Wild Reverend Mothers===
Another similar group was a sect of conservative [[Judaism|Jews]], located on [[Gammu]]. Though they still retained their ancestral religious traditions, they also learned many Bene Gesserit secrets, and started to produce their own Reverend Mothers (such as the Jewish Reverend Mother [[Rebecca]]). These Jewish Reverend Mothers did not emerge until the time of the [[Honored Matres]], however.

== Limitations of Sex ==
Typically, when women survived the [[Water of Life]] and unlocked [[Other Memory]], only the female line of ancestors were visible to them. It was believed that the male side terrified them, for reasons unknown. The Bene Gesserit [[breeding program]] was aimed specifically at breeding the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] - a male version of a Reverend Mother, who could potentially unlock the memories of both the female and the male ancestral lines. 

As explained by [[Paul Atreides]], the first Kwisatz Haderach, every human has within themselves "an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives" - a female (such as a [[Bene Gesserit]]) is able to fairly easily face her internal "giving force", but is utterly unable to see into her internal "taking force" without changing into something other than a woman, while the exact opposite is true for a male, who, while remaining a man, can fairly easily see into his internal "taking force", yet is unable to peer into his internal "giving force". Hence, Paul claims that he, as the Kwisatz Haderach, is something other than just a male, which allows him to see into both of his ancient internal forces as "the fulcrum", who "cannot give without taking, and cannot take without giving."   

===Exceptions===
There were, however, exceptions to this rule - [[Alia Atreides]] and her niece [[Ghanima Atreides]] were both capable of seeing the male and female ancestral lines. It should be noted, however, that both women were close relatives of the first [[Kwisatz Haderach]], [[Paul Atreides]] - Alia was his sister (who also suffered [[Abomination]], getting possessed by her inner [[Ego-memory|Ego-memories]]), while Ghanima was his daughter.

== Abomination ==
The possession of a multitude of ancestral [[Ego-memory|Ego-memories]] was both a blessing and a curse for those who possessed them - while they provided the individual with immense knowledge from past experiences, the Ego-memories of the person's ancestors could sometimes assert themselves, and eventually govern the person's behavior. At times, this would happen to such an extent that the individual was considered possessed. The term the Bene Gesserit used for this condition was [[Abomination]]. The only known cures for Abomination were a Trial of Possession, or death. Avoiding Abomination was actually as simple as waiting until adulthood to undergo the spice agony - once a Sister's personality and individualism were fully developed and matured, there was little danger of possession.

[[Paul Atreides]]' sister, [[Alia Atreides]], was accidentally transformed into a Reverend Mother [[Pre-born]]: while still in her mother Jessica's womb. The shock and trauma this brought on to the unborn child was catastrophic, and when she was in her early twenties, Alia ultimately succumbed to Abomination, and became possessed by the [[Ego-memory]] of her maternal grandfather, the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Harkonnen]].

Paul's twin children, [[Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]], were also pre-born like Alia, however, they strove to escape possession. When Leto was apparently killed, Ghanima constructed a mental wall of grief, which induced her conscious self to believe that Leto was indeed dead. This process also cut off her [[Ego-memory|Ego-memories]] to a level that prohibited possession. Leto, however was forced to consume great quantities of spice, and while claiming he was not possessed, much later admitting this to be a lie, by the definition of the [[Bene Gesserit]]. In order to control his inner Ego-memories, Leto turned to one Ego-memory in particular, that of the ancient king [[Harum]]. However, this appears to be more of a ruling personality within the personalities Leto contained, rather than one personality taking over his flesh.

Kanly
{{Original}}

[[File:MaY4NfkEqIdN1Jqx3i8it5Q-1.jpg|thumb]]
'''Kanly''' was the enactment of a formal feud or vendetta in a manner that complied with the [[Great Convention]]. It often resulted in an official war of attrition between two opponents, usually Great Houses during the days of the [[Old Imperium]].

== Origins ==
The act of kanly was originally created as a way of allowing bitter disputes to be resolved without any harm being brought upon innocent bystanders. It was similar in many ways to the ancient duels made on [[Earth]], although it usually had much broader ramifications.
Kanly (kanlı) is a Turkish word meaning sworn enemy (bloody, from the stem ''kan'', blood). This animosity continued from father to son, until the last child was dead or the two families made peace.

== Examples of Kanly ==
Kanly has occurred most famously between [[House Atreides]] and [[House Harkonnen]], and between [[House Moritani]] and [[House Ecaz]], the Atreides/Harkonnen feud having gone on for millennia, since the end of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. In both situations, Kanly resulted in the dramatic success of the former party over the latter.

Kanly required that certain forms of conflict were permitted, while others were not. The use of nuclear weapons was forbidden, for example. Usage of nuclear weapons usually meant a sentence of exile.

Carryall
{{Original}}
A '''Carryall''' was a large winged, planet-bound [[Aircraft|aircraft]] or ship of [[spice mining]] teams on [[Arrakis]]. Carryalls are usually piloted by a crew of six spice miners or "[[dunemen]]", and could carry [[spice harvesters]] from one area to another.

Carryalls were a vital part of spice production. [[Spotters]] would be used to locate a [[spice blow]], while the carryall would lift the harvesters from the surface and release them on the spice blows for mining. Moreover, since [[sandworm]]s attacked all rhythmic vibrations, carryalls were required to lift the harvesters to safety when a worm attacked, a constant threat as harvesters generated considerable vibrations. Typically, the spotters would be used to locate [[wormsign]], electrical charges and ripples in the sand indicating a worm was on its way.

When [[House Atreides]] took control of Arrakis, there were just over a thousand carryalls in the equipment inventory. The vast majority were in dire need of repair, leaving about a third of the adequate number required to cover all the harvesters.

At one point, a party including the Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] was nearly killed when a worm attacked a harvester the party was observing. A [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] agent among the crew had overpowered the others and tried to offload it to [[spice smugglers]]. The smugglers in question belonged to [[Esmar Tuek]], and had turned over the man and carryall to Atreides forces. This gesture on the part of Tuek earned the gratitude of the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]].

==Notes==
*The descriptions of Carryalls seem contradicting, while at one time they are described as giant wings, another time they are described as disc-like, and a third time they are likened to oversized [[Ornithopter]]s. In most computer games the carryalls seem to work rather like [[levs]] or [[flyers]] rather than ornithopters or "wings".
*The fictional term used for them is an obvious English portmanteau of "carry" and "all", indicating their role as heavy-duty aerial vehicles capable of transporting even the largest loads.

Ghanima Atreides
{{Original}}

[[File:Ghanima2.jpg|thumb]]
'''Ghanima Atreides''' (b. [[10210 AG]]) was the daughter of [[Paul Atreides]] and his [[Fremen]] concubine [[Chani Kynes]]. She was born a little time before her twin brother [[Leto Atreides II]], the [[God-Emperor]]. [[Farad'n Corrino]], heir to [[House Corrino]], was her consort.

==History==
===Upbringing===
Ghanima, or Ghani as she was also known, was born on [[Arrakis]] in [[Sietch Tabr]] twelve years after the ascent of Paul Atreides to the role of Emperor. Ghanima's mother was Paul's official concubine [[Chani]], a [[Fremen]], though the children never knew their mother in person. Shortly after the twins' birth their mother died due to labor complications.

Ghanima (Arabic "غنيمة"), was named for the [[Fremen language|Fremen term]] 'spoil of war', a cynical reference by her father for the joy she brought in such a painful and destructive time. Paul's prescience had revealed to him Ghanima’s birth, but not that Ghanima  would have a twin brother, Leto II.

Ghanima was to be raised without her father, for shortly after her birth he walked into the desert, as was the custom for blind Fremen. As a result, she was raised by her aunt, Regent [[Alia Atreides]] and her stepmother, Princess [[Irulan Corrino]].

Ghanima lacked the assertive streak and degree of prescience of her twin brother. However, thanks to the pair's genetic heritage and the large consumption of [[Spice Melange]] by their mother, Ghanima was [[pre-born]] and came into being with a full, adult consciousness. Thus she possessed wisdom far beyond her years, and a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]]'s skills and ability to recall knowledge from her female ancestors (there is some indication that she had access to her male-line Other Memory as well).

As the twins grew their extraordinary powers became more visible. The Bene Gesserit feared they had been born into [[Abomination]], like their aunt [[Alia Atreides|Alia]]. However, the twins proved able to control the consciousness of the countless ancestors that lurked in their minds, although they occasionally played with fire by calling upon and assuming their parents' personalities as a game.

=== The Golden Path ===
For a while Ghanima provided her brother with guidance on the formation of the [[Golden Path]]. However, as they approached Fremen adulthood, Leto began to conceal aspects of the Path from Ghanima, primarily for her own protection. Leto knew that if he were to reveal the full extent of the Golden Path, that out of her love for her brother, Ghanima might try to prevent him from making it a reality.

Ghanima was the target of an assassination attempt orchestrated by the Princess [[Wensicia Corrino]]. The plot involved providing Ghanima and her brother with a royal gift of fine cloaks. The cloaks had transmitters in them that would attract [[laza tiger]]s when they would next be in the desert. After this assassination attempt, Leto knew that if Ghanima believed Leto to be dead, that this may make the conspirators reveal themselves. Ghanima therefore agreed to Leto's request of being conditioned to believe him dead, thus leaving him free to take the next steps on the Golden Path alone.

===Life in Hiding===
Fearing for Ghanima's safety, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]] placed her step-daughter under [[Stilgar|Stilgar's]] protection, where she largely remained until Leto reappeared several months later. Having revealed himself, the transformed Leto quickly took over leadership of the Empire from Alia, who had by that time fallen totally under the control of the late Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Vladimir Harkonnen's]] personality.

===Life as Empress===
Leto controversially decided to marry his sister, making Ghanima Empress and consolidating House Atreides' hold on the Imperial Throne. The pair never consummated the marriage. The decision was political, born out of a desire to prevent another of the [[Great Houses]] from marrying his sister and thereby attempting to wrest control from him.

However, for the good of the [[Golden Path]], Leto made [[Farad'n Corrino]], the heir of [[House Corrino]], Ghanima's official and exclusive consort. From this union, Leto wrested control of the [[Bene Gesserit]] breeding program, and Atreides, Harkonnen and Corrino genes were seeded throughout the Empire through Ghanima and Farad'n's descendants. As Leto had planned, these descendants became countless over the next few thousand years, and formed a strong genetic basis for such traumatic historical events as [[the Scattering]]. Among Ghanima and Farad'n's descendants were [[Siona Atreides]].

Usul
{{Original}}
{{DE}}
'''Usul''' was a [[Fremen]] word meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar".

It was the name given to [[Paul Atreides]] when he was given sanctuary with [[Sietch Tabr]] by its [[naib]], [[Stilgar]]. Openly Paul was to be referred to as [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]]. However, Usul was the private name used within the Sietch. It was to be the name his beloved [[Chani]] would use for him, and the last word she cried before she died giving birth to their children.

Stilgar gave Paul this name after witnessing him defeat one of their finest warriors, [[Jamis]]. It would appear that Stilgar saw a certain strength in the boy.
==Etymology==
Like various other Fremen words, the term "[[wikipedia:Usul|Usul]]" comes from the Arabic word أصول, meaning "fundamental principle(s)".

House
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:Dune2_houses.png|thumb|Great Houses in ''[[Dune II]]'']]

A '''House''', or a '''Great House''', in the time of the [[Imperium]], was a dynastic seat of power, sometimes limited to a [[Planet|world]] and sometimes spanning several worlds. Numerous Houses existed within the imperial hierarchy, and collectively they formed the [[Landsraad]], which was governed by the [[High Council]]. Houses could be differentiated into ''Houses Major'' and ''Houses Minor.'' 

==Balance of Power==
Each House usually maintained a base of operations on a specific [[planet]] - typically their ancestral homeworld. Banished Houses were exiled to the set of planets collectively known as [[Tupile]]. Banishment was usually decreed by the [[Emperor]], or by a ruling of the Landsraad. This would usually occur because the House in violated the [[Great Convention]] by employing [[atomics]] against human beings or because the offending House committed a terrible crime, such as high treason.

Not surprisingly, some Houses possessed more power and influence than others. Some even possessed enough power to rule entire planetary systems. These were known as ''Great Houses'', ''Major Houses'', or ''Great Families''. It was from one of these Houses that control of the [[Imperium]], the official realm of the [[Known Universe]], was maintained. For more than 10,000 [[Standard year|standard years]], the Imperium was ruled by [[Imperial Family|imperial]] [[House Corrino]].

As a consequence of this governmental structure, there was a near-constant state of plotting conducted between the various noble Houses, though on occasion two or more Houses would form an alliance with one another to thwart or destroy a rival House.

This House system represented the nobility of the Imperium, and formed part of the [[Faufreluches]] class system: ''"A place for every man, and every man has a place."''

== Houses Major ==
Typically, a Major House was a familial dynasty that ruled a planet or a planetary system. During the time of the [[Padishah Emperor]]s, this usually took the form of a [[Fief|fiefdom]] handed down by the Emperor himself. 

A Major (or Great) House that ruled a planet was ruler of that world, and charged by the Emperor to uphold the laws of the [[Imperium]], and the galactic order of the Faufreluches. A Great House would usually have its own standing [[army]], flag, symbol, coat-of-arms, and representative colors. It was said that only the combined military power of all the Great Houses in the Imperium would have been enough to defeat the [[Sardaukar]] armies of the Corrino Emperors. Thus, a delicate balance was struck between the Great Houses and the Imperial House, since all the Great Houses were never expected to ally themselves together against the Emperor, or anyone else. Indeed, during the time of the Corrinos, the majority of Great Houses seemed to be preoccupied with petty squabbles.

Each Great House maintained trade and business interests, and some Minor Houses could, over time, be granted Great House status through amassed [[Solari|wealth]] from enterpreneurial endeavors.

== Great Houses and the Bene Gesserit ==
Some of the richer Great Houses paid the [[Bene Gesserit]] to train the females of the household. The Bene Gesserit also incorporated members of Great Houses into their [[Breeding program|Breeding Program]] over the course of the millennia. Bene Gesserit sisters also became part of Great Houses by either being taken as wives or as [[Concubine|concubines]] by male members of Great Houses.

== The Landsraad ==
Titles for the heads of Great Houses were usually [[Duke]], [[Archduke]], [[Viscount]], [[Count]], or [[Baron]]. Collectively, the Great Houses decided matters among themselves through the [[High Council]], which was overseen by the Emperor. Great Houses also maintained a stake in [[CHOAM]] through the Landsraad.

== Houses Minor ==
Houses Minor, or the [[Richece]], were aristocratic dynasties that were largely planet-bound. They did not rule planets but were regarded as nobility nonetheless, either through bloodlines or through the accumulation of wealth. They also enjoyed a small vote on the Landsraad. Houses Minor were frequently guests in the dining halls and entertainment events of Great Houses.

Presumably, Houses Minor would be found in large numbers on planets with strong trade or planets where the Great Houses ruling them maintained large extended families. Some Houses Minor were more famous than others, depending on the items they were known to trade.

== Houses Under Paul Atreides ==
During the imperial reign of Paul Atreides, very little was revealed about the fate of the Great Houses. It was believed that the majority of them managed to maintain their status, provided that they recognised Atreides ascension to the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. Some, however, appeared to fall under the [[Fremen]] Jihad that swept the universe after Paul's ascension.

== Houses Under Leto II ==
Shortly into his reign, [[Leto Atreides II|Emperor Leto II]] dissolved the Landsraad. During the 3500 years that Leto ruled the Empire, many of the Great Houses had disappeared, since Leto's control over space travel and monopoly on melange meant that trade and political maneuvering was virtually impossible. Particularly in the last 1000 years of Leto's reign, the Great Houses experienced a significant downturn. Though he permitted them to exist, Leto regarded the remaining Great Houses as "degenerate".

In one Bene Gesserit reporting period just prior to Leto's death, 31 Great Houses experienced complete economic collapse. Of these 31, six managed to maintain House Minor status through heavy investment in the [[Star Jewel Project]] and diversified investment portfolios.

It was also during this time that the fees charged by the Bene Gesserit for the schooling of Great House females were doubled.<ref>'''God Emperor of Dune, page 72'''</ref>

== The Scattering and beyond ==
In the 1500 years after Leto's death, it appeared that some Great Houses continued to exist, and some of them managed to re-emerge and reaccumulate power and wealth to some degree. This was possibly because the lack of a central power figure and rigid structure in the Old Imperium had left a power vacuum.

==Behind the Scenes==
While [[Frank Herbert]] named a few Houses, the fact that others exist (more than 31) is mentioned in ''[[God Emperor of Dune (novel)|God Emperor of Dune]]''. Some of these Houses were later named through other sources, such as ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'', and the novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]].

Frank Herbert mentions in ''[[Heretics of Dune (novel)|Heretics of Dune]]'' that Great Houses were beginning to re-emerge some 1500 years after the death of [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]]. However, it is not known whether these re-emerging Great Houses were the same as those that existed during the days of the Imperium, or whether they were new ones.

The list of known Great Houses has been embellished from ''The Dune Encyclopedia''. These are officially [[Canon|non-canon]], despite the book being "authorised" by both the publishers and Frank Herbert at the time.

Orange Catholic Bible
{{Or-DE,Ex}}


{{Book_infobox|title=Orange Catholic Bible|book name=[[Dune (novel)]]|published=[[Commission of Ecumencial Translators]]|date published=c. [[50 BG]]|next=[[Revised Orange Catholic Bible]]|image=Orange-catholic-bible-515794a5-254a-4ee9-84a4-0fd3790784c-resize-750.jpg}}

The '''Orange Catholic Bible''' (or '''OC Bible''' or '''OCB''' for short), also known as the '''''Accumulated Book''''', was one of the most important religious texts in the [[known universe]].

It was supposed to be a fusion of all significant religious thought in human history, with a strong emphasis on religious beliefs originating on [[Earth]]. These included the [[Maometh Saari]], [[Mahayana Christianity]], [[Zensunni]] Catholicism, and [[Budislamic]] traditions. It was produced by the [[Commission of Ecumenical Translators]] in the wake of the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. Its supreme commandment was:

"''Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.''"

==Devotees of the Orange Catholic Bible==
Among the more prominent devotees of the Orange Catholic Bible were:
* Doctor [[Wellington Yueh]]
* [[Gurney Halleck]]

==Selected Quotes from the Commission's Orange Catholic Bible Commentaries==
*''&mdash; and on the seventh day He rested.''
*''Thou shall not suffer a witch to live.''
*''The meek shall inherit the universe.''
*''Men, finding no answers to the sunnan [the ten thousand religious questions from the Shari-ah] now apply their own reasoning. All men seek to be enlightened. Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of God's universe. Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.''
*''When law and religious duty are one, your selfdom encloses the universe.''
*''Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.''
*''Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.''
*''Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future.''
*''The Universe is God's. It is one thing, a wholeness against which all separations may be identified. Transient life, even that self-aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness.''
*''Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you've always known.''
*''Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind.''
*''Some Lies are easier to believe than the truth.''
*''Knowledge is pitiless.''
*''Fate and Hope only rarely speak the same language.''
*''Beware the seeds you sow and the crops you reap. Do not curse God for the punishment you inflict upon yourself.''
*Psalm 29
*''Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? (5.44)''

==Behind the Scenes==
The date of the compilation of the OCB has not been established by Herbert, although according to ''[[Sisterhood of Dune]]'', it was compiled in 25 BG. Also, no explicit listing of the books contained within the Orange Catholic Bible are given in the ''Dune'' novels, although ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'' provides such a list.

The Orange Catholic Bible is said to have been a book of only 1800 pages.

"Orange" appears to be an etymological corruption of the part of the official designation, Koranjiyana, using only the first two syllables and dropping the first consonant.

"Orange" could also refer to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangism_%28Northern_Ireland%29 Orange Institution], a Protestant Christian movement that was often at odds with the Roman [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church Catholic Church].

==In other media==

In Denis Villeneuve's 2021 ''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune: Part One]]'', [[Gurney Halleck]] is seen reading the Orange Catholic Bible and quotes from it several times, as he did in the novel (The book prop Josh Brolin is seen holding as Gurney in the movie is a copy of "[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vier_B%C3%BCcher_vom_wahren_Christentum Vier Bücher vom wahren Christenthum]" by 16th century German theologian [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Arndt Johann Arndt]). The name "Orange Catholic Bible" isn't mentioned on screen. Villeneuve admitted that he scripted the scene from the novel of Dr. Yueh giving Paul his wife's old copy, explaining in dialogue that it is the "Orange Catholic Bible", but it was cut for time and pacing reasons.

'''Siridar-Baron''' '''Vladimir Harkonnen''' ([[10110 AG]] - December [[10193 AG]]), commonly known as the '''Baron Harkonnen,''' was the penultimate ruler of [[House Harkonnen]], and the chief architect in the demise of [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] of [[House Atreides]] during the latter part of the reign of [[Shaddam IV]]. 

==Biography==

===Early life===

Born the son of a Harkonnen Baron, Vladimir showed an early interest in attaining power, and was trained to become the heir to [[House Harkonnen]], ahead of his more mild-mannered half-brother [[Abulurd Rabban|Abulurd]]. During this time, his father served as head to the House Harkonnen and as [[Siridar]] and [[Baron]] of the planet [[Giedi Prime]].

Vladimir built upon the earlier success of his predecessors, gradually making [[House Harkonnen]] more successful through blackmail, subterfuge and treachery.

===Leadership ===

However, his expectations in this sense were not easily achieved. He deemed [[Glossu Rabban|Glossu]] too brutish and stupid to be an effective successor. And despite showering [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen|Feyd-Rautha]] with praise and the promise of eventual leadership, his hold over the cunning and impulsive youth remained tenuous, with Feyd-Rautha even attempting to poison the baron by surgically placing a needle containing what was presumably a slow-acting toxin into the thigh of Harkonnen's male child sex slave.

The Baron recognized efficiency and talent in people, and he has shown remarkable insight in knowing people. This was shown plainly in his use of the twisted Mentat, [[Piter de Vries]]. This was also implied in the way he, aged 81, developed the roles his nephews (Feyd and Glossu) eventually took, in an ultimate, yet unsuccessful plan to reinstate Harkonnen power in Arrakis. He also was at least capable of recognizing weaknesses towards himself that bar him from pursuing otherwise advantageous strategies, as implied by when he snapped at Feyd-Rautha when the latter asked why he never got a Bene Gesserit slave despite the obvious advantages it would bring him due to their truthsayer nature "You know my tastes!", implying that he knew his homosexual tastes would bar him from making any effective use of one regardless of their benefits to him.

As a leader of a [[House|Major House]], Vladimir proved to be incredibly cruel, earning House Harkonnen its notorious reputation. He has been described as a seeker of thrills and pleasures, and showed sadistic pedophilic tendencies. At least once, he has even arranged for a male sex slave he had previously purchased at [[Gamont]] to be drugged before retiring to his chambers due to "not feeling like wrestling." He had no qualms in using widespread torture, murder and slavery to maintain power, as is shown, for instance, in his mistreatment of [[Wellington Yueh|Yueh]] and [[Thufir Hawat]]. The cruelty also characterized the way House soldiers and administrators handle subordinates and prisoners. He was also known to exploit his cruel and ruthless reputation by doing executions perceived to be the result of extremely trivial matters as a way to subtly get rid of threats. This was especially evident in how he dealt with Feyd-Rautha's co-conspirators in the attempted assassination of the baron, where he had the Slave Master summarily executed under the pretense of losing a chess game against Feyd-Rautha, as well as two guards being summarily executed shortly afterward due to their carrying the Slave Master's corpse away without dignity. His cunning elements were also emphasized with his method of handling [[Wellington Yueh]] and his role in Duke Atreides' betrayal, where he twisted the words in such a way where he simultaneously kept the letter of the agreement and broke the agreement by "adhering" to his promise of freeing Yueh's wife by "freeing her from her mortal bonds" (ie, killing her) as well as "reuniting" Yueh with her by having him die immediately afterward, and implied he chose this method precisely because a traitor, even one of his own making, is never to be trusted. He is also demonstrated to be very callous towards his own forces, as he did not hesitate to leave his men to die in Leto's holding area just to escape the latter's suicidal attack towards him, either by locking the door behind him (book) or by floating away (miniseries), and celebrating his own survival over those of his men. And though he was generally cunning, his arrogance and intense hatred of [[House Atreides]] proved to be his un-doing.

===Death on Arrakis===

Vladimir Harkonnen died, aged 83, during the defeat of [[House Harkonnen]] and [[Sardaukar]] forces at the hands of the [[Fremen]] on [[Arrakis]] in the year 10,193. While watching the looming [[Fremen]] forces he was poisoned with a [[Gom Jabbar]], wielded by a young [[Alia Atreides]], his granddaughter.

When he was killed by Alia, House Harkonnen passed to his na-Baron, [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnon|Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]]. He challenged [[Paul Atreides]] to a duel, which Paul won. After Paul defeated Feyd, House Harkonnen passed to the next living heir, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], who declined the title. Paul then ruled that House Harkonnen passed to himself as the last living heir, and became subsumed into the throne.

However, death was not the end for Vladimir. Paul's sister, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], was born with her ancestral memories in the womb, including Vladimir himself. Alia fell victim to the Bene Gesserit prediction and initially shared control of her body with the Baron, gradually falling under his power. The vengeful desires of the residual Vladimir Harkonnen persona proved fruitless due to [[Alia Atreides|Alia's]] eventual success in overcoming her possession by suicide.

== Appearance ==

In his later years, the Baron's most notable feature was his corpulent frame. Vladimir's sheer weight required belt-mounted suspensors to retain mobility, which allowed him to float in midair from place to place, as he was unable to walk under his own power unassisted. It's implied that the Baron's weight was simply the result of his unchecked gluttony, but in the [[Expanded Dune]] universe, it's attributed to the Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] purposely infecting him with a degenerative disease when he raped her. The suspensors also allowed for some levitation to a certain degree, as when he died, his corpse hung inches from the floor while lying sideways.

He was originally a tall, muscular man with red-gold hair in a distinctive widow's peak. Later, he was so morbidly obese that he required suspensors harnessed to his flesh in order to walk. He had spider-black eyes, cheeks like two cherubic mounds, protruding lips and bobbing jowls. 

In the David Lynch movie, the baron is hefty, has blue eyes, but is much more unsightly. He has been experimenting with diseases and willingly infecting himself, causing pulsating boils and cysts to sprout all over his skin. His hover suit now appears to be woven into his flesh. He is also much less sane than the other versions of his character, often reduced to a near-psychotic state when overexcited.

In the 2021 movie, the baron's hover suit is now an implant in his spine, and he is ghost-pale (due to the lack of sunlight on the Giedi Prime) and bears a shaven head. While obese, he is also broad-shouldered and has thick, well-muscled limbs, and is structurally quite handsome. On a similar note, because he tends to wear lengthy robes, the robes combined with his implant causes him to appear abnormally tall (appearing at least nine feet tall while hovering).

==Discrepancies between Encyclopedia and Prelude material==

In [[The Dune Encyclopedia|The Dune Encyclopedia,]] the Bene Gesserit Reports suspect he was not homosexual, but was rather suppressing his Oedipal Complexe, after having sex with his own mother prior to her death. While his affection for boys and young men was the result of a deep narcissism, he himself suffered from psychosomatic impotence. It is implied that he originally had been in love with [[Tanidia Nerus/DE|Jessica's mother]], but later eventually tried to kill her. However, in [[Prelude to Dune]] he displayed pederastic tendencies from the beginning, but was blackmailed by [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]]. He submitted to the blackmail, but attained revenge by raping her..Prelude to Dune also alleges that his obesity is not the result of his general insatiable personality but rather the result of a genetic disease inflicted upon him by the Bene Gesserit, which also serves as the genesis of his enmity towards them.

== Behind the Scenes ==

Alejandro Jorodowski wanted famed actor, director and screenwriter Orson Welles to portray Harkonnen in his [[Dune (unreleased film)|unsuccessful attempt]] to produce a film adaptation of ''Dune''.

In the 1984 [[Dune (1984 movie)|movie adaptation]] of ''Dune'', Vladimir Harkonnen was played by the late Kenneth McMillan. In the 2000 ''Dune'' and 2003 ''Children of Dune'' mini-series the character was played by Ian McNeice. In the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 film adaptation]], the character was played by Stellan Skarsgård. In the 1984 movie, Harkonnen was given more gritty and hideous appearance, including the presence of black pustules that constantly require draining, as well as made significantly more unstable than in the original book. His fate was also altered slightly in the 1984 film as well: Alia, instead of merely poisoning him, proceeded to also telekinetically shove him through a damaged wall during the climactic battle, resulting in a giant worm devouring him. In the 1984 movie, miniseries and 2021 movie, he was also shown to levitate due to his suspensors, whereas in the book, save for the narration for when he is killed, the suspensors are only stated to be necessary for him to walk.

Bi-lal kaifa
{{Original}}

'''Bi-lal kaifa''' is a ritual intonation of the [[Fremen]]. 

==Definition==

It is used similarly to the Christian "[[wikipedia:Amen|Amen]]!"; in [[Chakobsa]] the literal meaning is "nothing further need be explained".

==Behind the Scenes==

Bi-lal kaifa is Arabic, بلا كيف, roughly: 'without asking how' or 'without [knowing] how'. It was a way of resolving theological problems in Islam over apparent contradictions in verses in the Qur'an by accepting without questioning. In Islamic theological discourse, it refers to an ancient dispute on the attributes of God (e.g. face, hand, ...etc.), and how different groups interpreted them. Another was the question of how the Quran could be both the word of God, but never have been created by God because (as many Hadith testified) it has always existed. The traditionalists (e.g. Ash'ari) chose to accept them as is, 'without how'. The rationalists (e.g. Mu'tazili) chose to interpret them allegorically. The phrase Bi-La Kaifa means "without a how". This term is not used often in modern times, except in theological circles. It is amazing that [[Frank Herbert]] would be exposed to this term, and make use of it.[http://baheyeldin.com/literature/arabic-and-islamic-themes-in-frank-herberts-dune.html]

Another possible literal definition could be "Any other explanation is useless".

Chapterhouse
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Chapterhouse_by_spacefriend_t_d2e8r84-350t.jpg|thumb|Fan Art :Chapterhouse by Spacefriend-T on DeviantArt]]


'''Chapterhouse''' is the term used by the [[Bene Gesserit]] for the planet considered to be their home base. This planet has changed over the centuries of the existence of the Bene Gesserit. Speculation would put the original Bene Gesserit home base on the planet [[Rossak]].

The planet used as the secret headquarters of the Bene Gesserit is seen as a temporary base, and because of this  the planet is never quite 100% settled and if needed, the Bene Gesserit can completely abandon the planet in very short notice leaving very little trace of their time spent.

Chapterhouse has been the same planet for more than 1500 years, which means "temporary" headquarters is somewhat of a loose term.

This current planet had been used as the Bene Gesserit headquarters from approximately the time of [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II's]] death onward. They utilized [[No-ship]]s in a defensive, encapsulating perimeter around the planet to mask its existence from prescient individuals who may be searching for the location of their headquarters, such as the [[Honored Matres]].

The planet was largely an average photosynthesis range, maintained through the use of Weather Satellites. However, after the planet [[Arrakis|Rakis]] was destroyed by the Honored Matres, the Bene Gesserit turned much of Chapterhouse into desert, so that the last surviving [[sandworms|sandworm]] could survive on the planet. This was done so that the [[spice melange]] would continue to be produced, which became all the more vital since the [[Bene Tleilax]], the largest producers of melange were also destroyed by the Honored Matres.

Chapterhouse was also where the Bene Gesserit maintained their main library. However, because the loss of information and historic records was far too great a risk, the majority of information kept by the Sisterhood was maintained through [[Other Memory]].

Settlements on Chapterhouse included [[Central]], where the [[Chapterhouse Keep]] was, [[Pondrille]] and [[Eldio]].

Dar-es-Balat
{{Original}}


[[File:Daresbalat.jpg|thumb]]

'''Dar-es-Balat''' was a site on [[Arrakis|Rakis]] where the God-Emperor [[Leto Atreides II]] constructed the [[no-chamber]] that held his account of his millennia-long reign. This site was discovered and excavated by [[Hadi Benotto]], but the excavation reports were suppressed on the orders of the [[Rakian Priesthood]]. The [[Bene Gesserit]] Archives acquired copies despite the suppression.

Later a city was built at Dar-es-Balat with the Rakian Priesthood having a presence there - the senior priest being [[Albertus]].

==Behind the Scenes==
The name Dar-es-Balat is improper Arabic—often an apparent source language for place names and elements of Fremen culture on Arrakis. In Arabic, Dar-es-Balat would properly be Dar el-Balat. The usage in [[God Emperor of Dune (novel)|''God Emperor of Dune'']], [[Heretics of Dune (novel)|''Heretics of Dune'']] and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'' is most probably based on the Arabian place name Dar es Salaam, where the article ''el- ''or ''al-'' is assimilated to the following consonant, so that both words contain "s" rather than "l" and "s".

Deathstill
{{Original}}

[[File:Funeral.jpg|thumb]]

A '''Deathstill''' was a place where the water of a person's dead body could be reclaimed. On [[Arrakis]], water was the most precious commodity. According to [[Fremen]] tradition, a man's water belonged to his tribe. As a result, the Fremen developed deathstills as a way of reclaiming the water of their dead, since it belonged to the tribe, and the dead had no further use of it.

The Fremen also put the deathstills to use for reclaiming the water of their enemies. It was usual practice for Fremen women and children to go through a battlefield when fighting was over, killing the wounded soldiers of the enemies with their [[crysknife|crysknives]], so that their water could be reclaimed in the deathstills.

Presumably, the water reclaimed from the deathstills would be used to water the sietch, and possibly go toward the terraforming of Arrakis begun by Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]]. It was stored in [[catchbasin]]s.

The only way in which someone's water would not be reclaimed by the tribe through the deathstills is they were found guilty of something so heinous that their water was considered tainted. An example of this was the people of [[Sietch Jacurutu]], and [[Alia Atreides]] (whose water was poured onto the sand due to her possession).

Desert hawk

[[File:Hawk-drawing-desert-hawk-6.jpg|thumb]]

A '''Desert Hawk''' is a bird-of-prey whose natural habitat was the open desert on the planet [[Arrakis]].

Upon the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] arrival on Arrakis in [[10,191]] [[A.G.]], The [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] came to believe that true power over the planet of Arrakis lay within the desert. As a result, the Desert Hawk developed significance, since the Atreides symbol had always been the [[Hawk]].

{{Original}}

[[File:701182d0df88df03ccfc1c2f27117586--dune-book-frank-herbert-1.jpg|thumb|Chapterhouse:Dune book cover]]

'''Dortujla''' is a banished [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother]] on [[Buzzell]], having been sent to the cold aquatic planet years before as punishment for the so-called "[[Jessica crime]]" — a love affair, forbidden by the Bene Gesserit as a weakness that could compromise their performance. She is tasked by [[Darwi Odrade]] to make contact with the [[Honored Matres]] on [[Junction]] and set up a meeting between [[Mother Superior]] Odrade and the [[Dama|Great Honored Matre]]. 

Dortujla, the head of a Sisterhood keep on Buzzell, arrives on [[Chapterhouse]] reporting that [[Handler]]s and their enslaved [[Futar]]s have offered alliance, though Dortujla's Mentat analysis suggests they intend dominance. She speculates that if the Handlers found Buzzell then Matres may found it too, because [[smugglers]] would have sold their information indiscriminately. Odrade sees an opportunity and orders Dortujla to return to Buzzell with the Sisterhood's offer of surrender. Dortujla is to set up a meeting at Junction — the old Spacing Guild complex — which the Honored Matres control.

Odrade goes to meet the Great Honored Matre with Dortujla and Tamalane.

Unfortunately, Dortujla dies due to an infection by a strong biological weapon.

Ego-likeness

[[File:Gunseng.jpg|thumb]]

An '''Ego-likeness''' was the portraiture of one or more people, reproduced through a [[shigawire]] projector, that was capable of showing subtle movements said to convey the mannerisms and ego essence of the subjects.

During his reign as [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] kept a collection of Ego-likeness projections he called his ''Hall of Portraits'' that featured various prominent figures, including Duke [[Leto Atreides I]].

The [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood also possessed a similar hall of portraits of people throughout history. When the [[Bashar]] [[Miles Teg]] examined the ego-likeness of the long-dead Duke Leto, he likened the experience as looking into a mirror.

Ghola
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-02-12-50-32-1.png|thumb|Ghola -Dune RPG illustration]]

A '''ghola''' was an artificially created human, who was replicated from a dead individual. Gholas were created in [[Axlotl tanks]] and could be reconstructed from as little as one cell from the original being. They were created almost exclusively by the [[Bene Tleilax]], although at least one (based on [[Miles Teg]]) was created by the [[Bene Gesserit]] shortly before the '''[[Return of the Honored Matres]]'''.

== Differences between gholas and clones ==
Though a ghola would at first seem synonymous with a clone, there were some key differences:
* To be considered a true ghola, the cells used to grow the ghola were collected after&nbsp;the original human had died, whereas a clone is grown from cells collected&nbsp;while the original human was still alive. Clones do not possess a "death memory" when the original memories are restored.
* Gholas possessed most (if not all) of the memories of the source human, thanks to a combination of conditioning and a variant on [[genetic memory]].
* Gholas originally possessed artificial 'metallic' eyes, due to an initial problem with the method of ghola production. This was later resolved, resulting in them possessing natural eyes.

== Awakening of Original Memories ==

[[File:Img172.jpg|thumb|Ghola Memories - Illustration by Klaus D.Schiemann]]

Up until the time of '''[[Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]]''', gholas were created to give people some comfort from the grief they experienced after the loss of someone close. However, this relief was limited because the gholas never remembered anything from their original lives. However, the Tleilaxu had long theorised that it was indeed possible to reawaken a ghola's original memories. This theory was based on the concept of '''[[genetic memory]]''', as well as collected evidence that gholas could experience "echoes" of their past life, namely feelings stirred up from sounds or smells.

To test this theory, the Tleilaxu had provided Muad'Dib with a ghola of Duncan Idaho. He possessed none of his original Idaho memories, and had been given the name of '''[[Hayt]]'''. Hayt was conditioned by the Tleilaxu to assassinate Muad'Dib. However, because of Idaho's innate love for the Atreides, Hayt could not reconcile this feeling with his conditioning. The psychological trauma that ensued from this paradox caused his Idaho's memories to emerge. As a result, the theory was proven correct.

After that, a similar process was used to '''reawaken pre-ghola memories''', whereby the ghola would be forced to experience some kind of psychological trauma to force the memories to the surface. This process continued until [[Miles Teg]]'s pre-ghola memories were awakened by [[Sheeana]] with sexual imprinting techniques, at the suggestion of [[Duncan Idaho]], who didn't like the original method.

== Recurrence of gholas ==
Gholas played an increasingly important role throughout the history of the [[known universe]], starting during the reign of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]]. Individuals who have been noted as being the source of one or more gholas included:

* '''[[Duncan Idaho]]''', who was replicated as a ghola countless times over the course of several thousand years. The last Idaho ghola of the [[Bene Gesserit]] had the memories of the original ''and'' the memories of all the other gholas; how this came about was never explained. Each Idaho ghola was produced by the [[Bene Tleilax]] and always possessed some deep-seated conditioning that was intended to assist the Tleilaxu in their political and cultural endeavors. The success of such conditioning was often poor or resulted in unforeseen consequences.

* '''[[Miles Teg]]''' was replicated once by the [[Bene Gesserit]] shortly before the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]]. As was the case with Idaho, Teg was conditioned to assist his sponsors' efforts, again with limited success. Though he was created using the same method as gholas, he was actually a clone due to the cells being taken before the original Teg's death.

* '''Various [[Tleilaxu Master]]s''' including [[Tylwyth Waff]] and [[Scytale]], were recreated as gholas.

Ixian Confederacy

The '''Ixian Confederacy''' was an organization which ruled the planet [[Ix]] for a time, formed when [[Paul Atreides]] took the [[Golden Lion Throne]] and became Emperor of the [[Known Universe]].

Ix offered submission to House Atreides in exchange for a legal limit to Paul's Imperial tax, claiming that they wanted a constitution, with the [[Landsraad]] or [[CHOAM]] governing Paul.

Paul forbade a constitution, claiming it would be detrimental to his people. This became an Order in Council and Paul decreed that the Guild, if they wanted his signature for the [[The Tupile Treaty|Tupile Treaty]], was to stop all trade from [[Ix]] until the Confederacy agreed to the tax. Without the Guild's transport, the Conferderacy eventually submitted.

Jihad
{{Original}}

[[File:Dune 1968 book cover front artwork (by Bruce Pennington).png|thumb]]

'''[[wikipedia:Jihad|Jihad]]''' is struggle for justice against oppression, a fight against evil by the masses, even by rebellion or armed resistance. The [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] and the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]] are seen as oppressors, and the [[Fremen]] (especially the [[Fedaykin]]), use armed resistance against them. This is labeled by [[Frank Herbert]] as Jihad, and is very close to the real meaning of the concept.

A Jihad is a verb meaning to "struggle" or to "strive". One can have an internal jihad, family jihad, or religious jihad, which may or may not include violence towards non-Muslims. A comparison may be made with the term "crusade", which is sometimes considered by Muslims to mean Western violence against Islam, when it is more often used as a metaphorical struggle; for example, "a crusade against drugs". However, Jihad can refer to a holy war, in the sense that it is ordained by God and is the only kind of warfare not considered a sin in Islam. The aim of such a religious jihad is not to convert non-Muslims to Islam but rather to defend the Islamic state.

[[Paul Atreides]] sees the jihad in some of his earliest prescient visions, and struggles to find a way forward that will not ignite the conflict throughout the universe. He fails, however, as when he achieves victory, the Fremen move forth throughout the universe, bringing "The Peace of Muad'dib" with them, forcing their religion on billions by the [[sword]].

It should be remembered also that in Dune, Jihad is not solely associated with Islam, or religion as a whole. As in the case of the [[Butlerian Jihad]] the use of the term Jihad was used to describe the plight of humanity as a whole.

[[File:House Atreides lasgun rifle (1984 Dune film).png|thumb|Lasgun rifle of House Atreides (''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'', 1984)]]
{{Original}}

A '''lasgun''' was a continuous-wave laser projector [[weapon]] that was perhaps the most widely used hand weapon in the [[Imperium]]. It commonly took the form of a pistol or rifle. Its firing pattern was typically a constant, narrow beam, but the nozzle could sometimes be adjusted to alter the width and spread of the beam. Its power source was a cell cartridge that could be replaced when depleted.

Size and form could vary from small, handheld lasguns to long field-models and large and armored heavy duty models. The [[Cutteray]] was essentially a Short-range version of a lasgun used mostly as a cutting tool and surgeon's scalpel.

During the days of the [[Old Imperium]], lasguns were often ornate in their design, with detailed scrollwork embedded into their handles, which were usually some exotic wood. However, by the time of the [[Honored Matres]], the designs had become less intricate and more functional.

Lasguns were the preferred weapon for armies. However, when [[shield]]s were being employed, lasguns were generally not used because contact reaction between a lasgun beam and a shield created a nuclear explosion that often killed everyone within a large radius.

During the time of the [[Faufreluches]], many soldiers and assassins preferred [[knives]] and [[sword]]s in combat, both because they safely penetrated personal shields, and because of newfound appreciation for the art of swordsmanship.

[[File:The Sardaukar Warriors (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb|Painting by John Schoenherr]]

'''Ornithopters''', also commonly referred to as ''''thopters''', were the most common small transport vessels in the [[Imperium]]. These [[Aircraft|aircraft]] were capable of carrying 6 passengers, 9 if the back seats were removed.

'Thopters were also very versatile. While they were capable of space travel over short distances, these small vessels were mostly operated in planetary atmospheres. Their uses varied from human transport between cities and continents, to light cargo transport across long distances.

'Thopters were often used for military purposes and equipped with weaponry. Usually these weapons were [[lasgun]]s, but they could also carry small missiles and repeating [[maula pistol]]s. With the exception of the planet [[Arrakis]], and for heavier cargo transportation, most ornithopters were equipped with [[shield]]s.

Most 'thopters were winged vessels that were capable of flight through jet propulsion, as well as by mimicking the movements of birds. While the jets were the primary propulsion system, the wings assisted in maintaining altitude, as well as maneuvered the vessels.

[[Carryall]]s were essentially large ornithopters.

'''Salusa Secundus''' is a planet of grim ecological and social conditions mostly famous for being the originator of [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]] and for serving as the imperial prison.

The planet suffers from both a rigorous climate and marginal natural resources. The temperature ranges between -45° and 60°C.

Its planetary name clearly implies that, like [[Giedi Prime/DE|Giedi Prime]] and [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], Salusa Secundus was named after a star. Secundus (Latin for "second") is a term sometimes used with the lesser of the two components of a binary star. One would expect a "Salusa Prime" somewhere.
==Flora==
This combined with the infertility of the soil favor a jungle ecology. Gigantic plant growth make efficient use of what nutrients are available, returning little to the soil as waste. 

After clearing the ground, the soil was poor and soon depleted. Only the hardiest crops survived the scorching summers. 

==Fauna==

The [[ganja]], a partially domesticated form of buffalo, supplied meat and skins. 

==Resources==

The chief ore was iron, in limited quantities.  Iron lodes were one of the reasons of the warring tribes. Smelters and foundries were special prizes because they provided the weapons needed for war. A tribe that controlled enough pasture for its herds and a reliable source of iron was self-sufficient.

==Population==

The population of the planet was always small. The native population were the [[Sardau]] until they left the planet and expanded. At the time of the [[Battle of Corrin/DE|Battle of Corrin]], the population probably did not exceed 5 million. 

It was divided in tribes who waged perpetual war over iron lodes and the scanty pasture land. Smelters and foundries were special prizes because they provided the weapons needed for war. A tribe that controlled enough pasture for its herds and a reliable source of iron was self-sufficient.

While the [[Zensunni/DE|Zensunni]] dwelt there, a language spoken on the planet was [[Tamashek]] which could have been the original language of the Sardau.

==History==

The ruthless natural selection of Salusa Secundus bred the [[Sardau]] tribe who came to dominate first their planet and later the inhabited worlds of the Imperium. The grim conditions forged their military prowess; the Sardaukar were master swordsmen and deadly unarmed combatants, comparable respectively to Ginaz tenth-level fencers and Bene Gesserit adepts. 

In [[388 AG]] usurper [[Saudir III]] designated the planet as a prison colony in order to deal with the captives of the recent [[Lishash Confederation]]. In [[390 AG]] [[Wallach I]] decided to use it as an experimental laboratory.

Knowing that the prisoners would not survive if exposed to the depredations of the native tribes, he provided them with training in the most ruthless fighting techniques and weapons while shielded by Sardaukar troops (who were later withdrawn). This technique begun the use of the planet as the training center of the Sardaukar. 

The descendants of the prisoners admired rather than hated the Sardaukar who had protected them. And when the colonists were given the opportunity to join them and thus leave Salusa Secundus forever, the choice was easily made.

In [[4495 AG]] [[Hanin Dart Famun]] became [[siridar]] of the planet.

Half the [[Zensunni]] of [[Poritrin]] were forced to migrate to Salusa Secundus in [[4492 AG]] <ref>''DE, page 513''</ref> They were to be slaves on this planet for nine generations until [[5295 AG]], when  they went to [[Ishia]].

Salusa Secundus and Dune were in fact analogous: as Salusa Secundus was to the Saudaukar and House Corrino; so Dune, to the Fremen of the Jihad and [[House Atreides]].

In [[5295 AG]], [[Ezhar VII]] released them, and the Zensunni were allowed to emigrate to [[Ishia]].<ref>''DE, page 514''</ref>

[[Thufir Hawat/DE|Thufir Hawat]] asked the question, "Were there people on Salusa Secundus before the Emperor sent his first contingent of prisoners there? Even the [[Leto I Atreides]], a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure." <ref>''Dune, page 37''</ref> He was but trying to lead the Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/DE|Vladimir Harkonnen]] into drawing the proper conclusions about the role this planet had played in Galactic history and understanding how badly the baron had erred in his interview with [[Hasimir Fenring/DE|Hasimir Fenring]] two years before.

=== Under Shaddam IV ===
{{original}}
In [[10193 AG]], [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] wrested the Imperial Throne from House Corrino. Before taking the throne, Paul promised [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]] that he would keep a throne on Salusa Secundus, and that the planet would be transformed into a pleasant and beautiful world. This move was outwardly to show that he maintained respect for Shaddam, but in truth the move was to rob the deposed Emperor of the training grounds for his Sardaukar.

Shaddam IV then went into retirement, ruling over Salusa Secundus with the majority of his Household in accompaniment. From his deposed home, Shaddam witnessed the birth of his grandchild, [[Farad'n Corrino]]; sired by [[Dalak Fenring]], whose mother was [[Wensicia Corrino]]. It was also from the planet that Shaddam continually tried to encourage [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring]] to re-join him, so that together they could wrest the Imperium back to [[House Corrino]].

After the aborted attempt on Paul's life on [[Arrakis]], by Hasimir's daughter, [[Marie Fenring]], who was killed by [[Alia Atreides]]; and the subsequent second attempt on his life by the Count himself; Hasimir and his wife, [[Margot Fenring]], were exiled permanently to Salusa Secundus.

==Name==

Salusa appears to be a Latin noun. There is a Latin noun salus, meaning "healthful"-but is a feminine noun of another declension.

The constellation Aries was known among the Jews as Shalish (variant Shalisha), the name of some sort of musical instrument. Herbert was aware of this, for the planet [[Chusuk]] is said to circle Theta Shalish.

Gamma Arietis is a binary star. If this can be taken to be (Gamma) Shalisha Secundus, then we possibly have our namesake for Salusa Secundus. 

One may also note that Herbert makes reference to the "golden light" of Salusa Secundus.<ref>''CD, page 179''</ref> This is, at least, not in contradiction to the spectral type of Gamma Piscium.

{{Succession|Title= Station of the [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|Zensunni Migration]]| Previous=[[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]]| Years=[[4492 AG]] - [[5295 AG]] | Next=[[Ishia]]}}

==Contradictions==

Salusa secundus is sometimes described as a Jungle Planet, at last once as a desert planet and a third time as cold and covered by great steppes.While a Planet may have extreme conditions and various climate zones which can include jungles as well as steppes and deserts,extreme hot and cold zones designations such as "Jungle Planet" or "Desert world" are at best misleading and inaccurate.

'''Shadout''' was a [[Chakobsa]] word meaning "well-dipper". It was often used as an honorary title for the head of household staff.

A known Shadout was [[Mapes]], who was head housekeeper at the Imperial Residence at [[Arrakeen]] on [[Arrakis]] in [[AG 10191]]

Shai-Hulud
{{Original}}

[[File:1e6f6fdedbdd9ab1ed3dc1a107a1b87e--dune-frank-herbert-melange-1.jpg|thumb|Shai-Hulud as depicted in Dune]]{{Quote|Over here sand blows, over there sand blows. Over there a rich man waits, over here I wait.|The Voice of Shai-Hulud, from the [[Oral History]]|God Emperor of Dune}}
'''Shai-Hulud''' (Arabic: شَيْء خُلُود ''Shayʾ-Khulud'') is the [[Fremen]] term for the [[sandworm]] of [[Arrakis]].

As with many [[Fremen]] terms and words, Shai-Hulud is more than a descriptive term for a physical entity. Specifically, it often alludes to the [[Fremen]] belief that the [[sandworm]] is a physical embodiment of the One God that created and governs the universe. Thus to the [[Fremen]] Shai-Hulud is a sacred term that is usually spoken with a tone of awe, fear, or respect.

Linguistically, Shai-Hulud has many poetic translations, all of which speak of the size, age, and power of the [[sandworm]]. Among the noted translations are:
* "Old Man of the Desert"
* "Old Father Eternity"
* "Grandfather of the Desert"

Arabic ''Shayʾ-Khulud'' translates as "Thing of Eternity" or "Thing of Immortality", consisting of ''Shayʾ'' "thing of" (in [[wikipedia:construct state|construct state]]) and ''Khulud'' "eternity" or "immortality".

Shai-Hulud is not to be mistaken with [[Shaitan]], a similar-sounding [[Fremen]] term that carries a very different meaning. 

Shai Hulud play a massive role in Fremen culture. The Fremen are known to ride sandworms and even capture them, their teeth being made into Crysknifes, the Fremen weapon of choice.

Siaynoq
{{original}}
[[File:Meeting_the_Emperor_by_Klausmasterflex.jpg|thumb]]

'''Siaynoq''' was a religious orgiastic, ecstatic sexual experience involving [[Fish Speaker]] leaders who were called to [[Arrakis]] every ten years to commune with the God Emperor [[Leto II]] in his Festival City of Onn.

Every 10 years the women leaders were gathered together from all over the Imperium, in a large amphitheater that Leto had built on Arrakis. The women were arranged in a giant circle, and the [[God Emperor]] would appear. After 3 to 4 hours of chanting Leto's name, and hearing him speak to them in intimate ways, the women would crescendo in an ecstatic ritual with Leto as their focus.

It is rumored that after Leto's death, and the subsequent colonization of planets by the Fish Speakers during [[The Scattering]], that the remnant and corruption of the concepts of Sianyoq, became one of the foundations of the [[Honored Matres]] sexual enslavement of males.

[[File:Img154.jpg|thumb|Siaynoq - Illustration by Klaus D. Schiemann]]

[[Leto II]] explained to [[Moneo Atreides|Moneo]] the many subtle meanings of the word 'Siaynoq':

:''"The ritual is called Siaynoq -the Feast of Leto. It is the adoration of my person in my presence."''

:''"An ancient ritual, Lord?"''

:''"It was with the Fremen before they were Fremen. But the keys to the Festival secrets died with the old ones. Only I remember them now. I recreate the Festival in my own likeness and for my own ends."''

:''Then the Museum Fremen do not use this ritual?"''

:''"Never. It is mine and mine alone. I claim eternal right to it because I am that ritual."''
:''"It is a strange word, Lord. I have never heard its like."''

:''"It has many meanings, Moneo. If I tell them to you, will you hold them secret?"''

:''"My Lord commands!"''

:''"Never share this with another nor reveal to the Fish Speakers what I tell you now."''

:''"I swear it, Lord."''

:''"Very well. Siaynoq means giving honor to one who speaks with sincerity. It signifies the remembrance of things which are spoken with sincerity."''

:''"But, Lord, doesn't sincerity really mean that the speaker believes... has faith in what is said?"''

:''"Yes, but Siaynoq also contains the idea of light as that which reveals reality. You continue to shine light on what you see."''

:''"Reality... that is a very ambiguous word, Lord."''

:''"Indeed! But Siaynoq also stands for fermentation because reality-or the belief that you know a reality, which is the same thing-always sets up a ferment in the universe."''

:''"All of that in a single word, Lord?"''

:''"And more! Siaynoq also contains the summoning to prayer and the name of the Recording Angel, Sihaya, who interrogates the newly dead."''

:''"A great burden for one word, Lord."''

:''"Words can carry any burden we wish. All that's required is agreement and a tradition upon which to build."''
:
:Moneo even added his own meanings to the word.
:
:''It means mystery and prestige. It means power. It envokes a licence to act in the name of God.''

Sietch Tabr
{{Original}}
[[File:Sietch Tabr (Frank Herbert's Dune, 2000, Sci-Fi Channel).jpg|thumb|Tabr in the Dune miniseries]]
'''Sietch Tabr''' was a major [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] [[Sietch]] on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. Its most famous native-Fremen leader was [[Naib]] [[Stilgar]].

Sietch Tabr was the Fremen community first encountered by [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and [[Jessica Atreides]] after their escape from [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] assassination attempts following the fall of [[House Atreides]] on Arrakis. As a result, it became their adopted home, and the foundation of the [[Arrakis Revolt]]; the resistance movement that eventually took control of Arrakis, and launched Paul's  [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|Jihad]].

Although Sietch Tabr lost some of its new-found authority after Paul became Emperor and moved his base of operations to [[Arrakeen]], it remained a powerful locale in Fremen culture and politics.

Eventually, and as with all Fremen sietches, Sietch Tabr was abandoned after the terraforming of Arrakis, and its exact location remained a mystery for thousands of years, until entered by [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]], shortly before it's destruction along with the rest of the planet following the [[Battle of Rakis]].

Siridar
{{Original}}

[[File:Dune-Ccg-Judge-Of-The-Change-2-Jotc-1-1.jpg|thumb|Siridar-Governor as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

'''Siridar''' is a [[Galach]] term for ''"planetary"''.

The term was used to describe planetary [[fief]]s during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. It was also a prefix for [[Baron]]s who were planetary governors (i.e., "Siridar Baron").

==Etymology==

It is possible that the Galach siridar, [[Fremen language|Fremen]] ''al-asiridar'' derive from the original Arabic ''as-sadar'' i.e. "voice" [of the Emperor], this usage presumably referring to the fact that the designated official speaks in the Emperor's name to stipulate what will happen. It could also come from Persian [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sirdar Sirdar/Sardar], signifying a military or political leader, and literally meaning "head holder".

Perhaps, the Galach term might also derive from English ''sidereal'' ("astral", "stellar", "of the star"), which itself originates in the Latin term ''sidus'' ("star"). In this context, it would refer to those who rule a star system.

Smuggler

[[File:51vLLh0XuDL._QL70_-1.jpg|thumb|Smuggler Ship as depicted in the Dune CCG]]


A '''smuggler''' was anyone who sold or transported contraban or controlled substances in the [[Imperium]].

Smuggling was common during the imperial rule of the [[House Corrino|Corrinos]], but became less practiced during the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] rule of [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]], who used [[prescience]] to maintain strict rule over the [[Known Universe]].

== Smuggling on Arrakis ==
Smugglers were common on the planet [[Arrakis]]. They usually dealt in the [[spice melange]], as well as other foodstuffs, weapons, and narcotics.

During [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] rule on Arrakis, smugglers tended to remain covert for fear of retribution. However, when [[House Atreides]] took over the Arrakis fief and all spice mining on that planet, Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] attempted to establish détente with the smugglers by informing them that he would ignore their operations, on the provision that they forwarded to Leto a percentage of their profits. This worked to some degree, as some of the smugglers assisted in capturing Harkonnen agents left behind from the previous fief, and turned them over to Atreides authorities.

[[Esmar Tuek]] was a known spice smuggler during the time when House Atreides took over spice mining on Arrakis in 10,191 A.G. When House Atreides was attacked by House Harkonnen in 10,191AG, some of Duke Leto's men managed to escape the ensuing onslaught by allying themselves with smugglers. The hope was that by remaining on Arrakis among the organised underworld, they would one day be able to exact retribution for the way in which their beloved Duke was defeated. Of particular note among the Duke's men to do this were [[Gurney Halleck]], the Atreides [[Warmaster]], and several men under his direct command.

Many years after returning to [[Caladan]], Halleck once more went to his smuggler friends on Arrakis to obtain information.

T-Probe
{{Original}}
A '''T-Probe''' is a torture/interrogation device used by the [[Honored Matres]] against [[Miles Teg]]. The device was designed to read the [[Genetic memory]] of the subject. It was this device that caused Teg's [[wild Atreides genes]] to kick in and allowed him to escape [[Giedi Prime]].

It is described a non-[[Ix]]ian interrogation device brought by the Honored Matres from [[The Scattering]]. The probe builds a 'digital framework' of the person which can be subjected to stimuli, and will respond as the person would. The T-Probe also causes massive, virtually unendurable pain in a living subject.

It is attached to the body through a series of "medusa contacts" placed around the skull and on major nerve centers. An operator can increase or decrease the power supplied to the probe to maximize its efficacy while at the same time not overloading the nervous system of the subject. While being subjected to the probe, Miles Teg's [[Mentat]] thinking deduces that not only can it "command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior," but also "The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified ... The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him."

[[Shere]] only prevents the T-Probe from recovering memories directly (as it does for the Ixian Probe) and does not impede any of the other features. Memories can still be guessed at from the model the probe constructs. The T-Probe is what causes Miles Teg's brain to change its structure, giving him the blinding speed and amazing abilities. This mental alteration continues in Teg even after being 'reborn' as a [[Tleilaxu]] [[ghola]].

The Life of Muad'Dib
{{original}}
'''''The Life of Muad'Dib''''' was the first publication printed by [[Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan Corrino]], the wife of Emperor Paul Atreides, after the [[Ascension of House Atreides/XD|Ascension of House Atreides]] to the throne of the [[Imperium]].

{{expanded}}
In the publication, Irulan presented what came to be known as a streamlined version of the life of [[Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] prior to his and including his victory over [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. Irulan wrote, and this version was published in the year [[10193 AG]] ''The Life of Muad'Dib'' was considered holy and religious reading for many of the loyal [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Jihad]]is who followed Paul after his takeover of the Golden Lion throne.

Later, after Irulan questioned the some of Paul's childhood accomplices, such as [[Swordmaster]] [[Whitmore Bludd]], about Paul's involvement in the [[War of Assassins of 10,187 AG]], Irulan had doubts about the publication, and questioned her husband. Paul calmly explained that this particular version of his life was streamlined, and that this version of his biography was made for mass consumption.

After Irulan questioned all of Paul's childhood friends and accomplices about Paul's early years, Irulan renamed this version of Paul's life, ''The Life of Muad'Dib, Volume 1''. The Princess found out that Paul had been born on [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], not [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]; that at 12 years of age he had been involved in the [[House Ecaz/XD|Ecaz]]i/[[Moritani]] struggle; and that he had run away to join a traveling [[Jongleur]] [[face dancer]] group.

To reconcile such differences, further details about Paul's birthplace and youth were fleshed out in Irulan's ''[[The Life of Muad'Dib, Volume 2]]''.

Thumper
{{Original}}

A '''thumper''' is a short stake with a spring-loaded clapper on one end. With the catch released, the thumper would pound repeatedly. It was used to summon a [[sandworm]] on the planet [[Arrakis]].

Some thumpers also had a candle, which, when lit, would last for approximately one hour. After the candle burned out, the catch would automatically be released, and the thumper would begin to pound.

The Water of Life originated on the planet [[Arrakis|Dune]]. It began its life as the bile of a young [[sandworm]], and, if it did not kill the [[Bene Gesserit]] or [[Sayyadina]] who ingested it, was converted into an [[awareness spectrum narcotic]] that was used in [[spice orgy|spice orgies]].  

== Cultural Importance ==
The untreated liquid was retrieved from the [[sandworm]] as it was drowned in water. The liquid exhalation only emerged right before the creature's moment of death. The typical reason for performing such an act was for the purposes of elevation of a Bene Gesserit Sister to [[Reverend Mother]] status.

In [[Fremen]] culture the event took on a more urgent tone: it normally occurred when a [[Sayyadina]] was dying and a replacement was required to receive her [[genetic memory]] before her demise. Typically a woman would be chosen from within the tribe for this task.

== Conversion Process ==
In the Bene Gesserit tradition, the bile was fed to a Sister after she had received many years of training in [[prana]]/[[bindu]] body control. This was because it was only the Bene Gesserit abilities of altering metabolism and slowing heart rates that could possibly neutralise the lethality of the chemical. The Sister regresses into a coma-like trance, and converts the toxic elements on a molecular level. If the Sister failed to metabolise the chemical, the poisonous bile would kill her. Were the Sister successful, however, the process would amplify her awareness to the point where it would unlock her [[genetic memory]], and along with it many secrets of the Sisterhood.

== Converted Water ==
Upon completion, the converted [[sandworm]] bile was regurgitated by new [[Reverend Mother]] or collected from perspiration on her skin. The chemical collected then officially declared the Water of Life. In [[Fremen]] culture it was then consumed by members of the [[sietch]]. The narcotic qualities resulted in the sietch members partaking in a [[spice orgy]].

== The Kwisatz Haderach ==
Since its inception, the taking of the Water of Life could only be conducted by women appropriately trained in [[prana]]/[[bindu]]. Any man who had attempted to consume the Water of Life met their untimely end. Bene Gesserit plans had it that the culmination of their [[breeding program]] would result in a male Bene Gesserit who could successfully convert the Water of Life. This man would be the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. 

In [[10193 AG]], [[Paul Atreides]] was the first male to succeed in converting the Water of Life, in a process that kindled new and immense powers in the young [[House Atreides|Atreides]] Duke. Before, and even after this attempt, many men had attempted the process and died. Paul had consumed only one drop of the bile, and it had put him into such a deep coma that he was believed dead. After three weeks, however, he emerged, having successfully converted the bile into the Water of Life. Along with it came many powerful abilities, such as perfect [[prescience]]. Paul informed Chani and his mother that not only could he see the past and future, but also the present, into the space above Arrakis, where the Emperor's invading fleet was orbiting the planet.

Abomination
{{Original}}

[[File:C20e758d596e8c082d1190b85e9d49b5-1.jpg|thumb|Heretics of Dune cover art]]

'''''Abomination''''' was a term used most commonly by the [[Bene Gesserit]] to describe individuals who could not control the [[ego-memory|ego-memories]] that had surfaced within them. These ego-memories usually surfaced after consumption of the [[Water of Life]], or through direct genetic inheritance in [[pre-born]] children.

Abominations, along with those who possessed [[genetic memory]], had access to vast knowledge. This, when combined with their psychological instability, those deemed ''Abomination'' were feared and considered very dangerous by the Sisterhood. Standing orders existed for Bene Gesserit that anyone believed to be Abomination were to be immediately killed.

The classic example of ''Abomination'' was [[Alia Atreides]], who was a fetus when her mother the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] converted the [[Water of Life]] and became a [[Reverend Mother]]. Being too young and weak to control the plethora of dynamic personalities that invaded her body via [[genetic memory]], Alia was never able to adjust to her situation and eventually succumbed to the personality of [[Vladimir Harkonnen]].

Other individuals manifested similar qualities, and thus were temporarily considered ''Abomination'' by some in the Bene Gesserit order. [[Leto Atreides II]] and his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides]] were examples of this. As the children of the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] [[Paul Atreides]], they possessed similarly formidable knowledge from their inception (they were [[pre-born]]) and would even play games together and temporarily allow the [[ego-memory|ego-memories]] of the Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] and the Lady Jessica to surface and interact with each other. Unlike their aunt, [[Alia Atreides]], [[Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]] were able to control these memories and avoid the depths of ''Abomination ''exhibited by Alia using disparate methods (Ghanima through the use of self-hypnosis, Leto II through a complex council/spokesperson). While Ghanima's escape of ''Abomination'' appears to have been successful, Leto II hints at the end of Children of Dune of the possibility that an ancient personality, [[Harum]], may either have or share power over the actions of Leto II.

Mentat
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[File:51b2t7c0V7L-1.jpg|thumb|House Mentat as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

A '''Mentat''' was a profession or discipline that was developed as a replacement to the computers and [[thinking machines]] following the [[Butlerian Jihad]] that banned the creation of machines in the human mind's image, just as the [[Spacing Guild]] and the [[Bene Gesserit]] took up similar functions.

==History==
===The first Mentat===
[[Gilbertus Albans]] displayed the first cognitive thinking and computer-like calculation capacity necessary for a Mentat, and founded the [[Order of Mentats]]. In the aftermath of the [[Butlerian Jihad]], computers and other forms of thinking technology were banned due to the [[OCB]]'s commandment against thinking machines ("''Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind''") and, at the same time, the anti-AI laws had been placed in effect; the punishment of owning such AI device or any kind being immediate death. Human computers, also known as Mentats, trained as replacements to the mechanical thinking technology, just as the all-female [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Spacing Guild|Guild of Navigators]] took up the same functions that had been previously covered by the Thinking Machines prior to the Jihad which banned all thinking technology.

===Impact of God-Emperor rule===
Along with the Spacing Guild and the Bene Gesserit, the rise of [[Leto Atreides II]] to the title of [[God Emperor]] brought with it new problems for the entire Mentat order. Leto's extremely long life, coupled with his goal to realize the [[The Golden Path|Golden Path]] in order to ensure humanity's survival, saw him hoard the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] seemingly without much concern for short-term problems. During the 3,500-year rule, the Order of Mentats formed a nucleus of independent opposition. They, like many other groups, were dispersed in the [[Scattering]]. Mentats were outlawed by God Emperor Leto II and any renegade training schools crushed. The art of being a Mentat was not eliminated, however. It survived through underground schools. The Bene Gesserit preserved the art, assuming that Leto knew of this and allowed it.

==Use of Mentats==
[[File:51z7QhQ11VL-1.jpg|thumb|Guild Mentat-Navigator]]

Mentats were used extensively by the [[Great Houses]], primarily as political advisors before the rise of God-Emperor Leto Atreides II to the throne. Thanks to their vast memories and ability to organize huge amounts of data, they often provided valuable insights that would otherwise be lost. Limited Mentat training was also used to augment individuals destined for other political or military roles.

Mentats were also used, to a lesser extent by the [[Bene Gesserit]]. Though unlike the Mentats employed by the Great Houses, all Bene Gesserit Mentats (like [[Tertius Eileen Anteac]] and [[Bellonda]]) were pre-conditioned [[Reverend Mother]]s.

==Mentat training==
The role of Mentat required a certain degree of mental ability and strict mental conditioning. Though not all Mentats were of equal ability, all were typically able to guarantee employment with one of the power brokers of the [[Known Universe]].

Unlike computers, however, Mentats were not only human calculators, since in addition to immense mathematical skills, Mentats also possessed the exceptional cognitive abilities of memory and perception, which were the foundations for supralogical hypothesizing, strategizing and tacticizing (skills in which the Mentats surpassed even those of the pre-Butlerian Jihad [[Thinking Machines]]). Thus, Mentats were able to gather large amounts of data and devise concise analyses in a process that went far beyond logical deduction: Mentats cultivate "the naïve mind", a supralogical mind without preconception or prejudice, one that can extract the essential patterns or logic of data and deliver, with varying degrees of certainty, useful conclusions. The hypothesizing, strategizing and tacticizing of highly skilled Mentats (like the first [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]], or [[Miles Teg]]), when provided with sufficient data, allowed for the deduction of probable future outcomes, akin to [[prescience]] (though with somewhat less clarity). This ability saw many military commanders and political leaders (such as [[Paul Atreides]], the [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho gholas]] and [[Miles Teg]]) undergo some form of Mentat training. [[Thufir Hawat]] was one of the few individuals whose innate Mentat abilities were immense enough for him to be an exclusive adviser to [[House Atreides]], with even the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] fearing Thufir's Mentat capabilities. 

The ability to become a Mentat was a talent limited to a small number of people; thus, those with the discipline were prized in whatever role they choose. There are also varying degrees of ability. Moreover, a Mentat's capabilities can be greatly increased by taking [[sapho]] juice, but using it leads to addiction. Sapho is extracted from the root of the Ecaz tree and its use doubles or even triples the Mentat's immense processing power. However, repeated use turns the user's lips a shade of red.

===Twisted Mentats===
Mentats were required to operate within an ethical framework, which for some purposes was not desired. Thus, the [[Bene Tleilax]] were known to condition some Mentats to be 'twisted'. These [[Twisted mentat|Twisted Mentat]] individuals, such as [[Piter de Vries]], were able to supralogically hypothesize, strategize and tacticize trends free of any ethical restraints or limitations.

==The Mentat Mantra (From David Lynch's movie as well as a game made by Westwood)==
''"It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, the stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion."''

Mahdi
{{Original}}

[[File:Paul Administers the Oath of the Fedaykin (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb|Painting by John Schoenherr.]]

'''[[wikipedia:Mahdi|Mahdi]]''', Arabic "المهدي" (al-Mahdi, lit. "the Guided One") or "المنقذ" (al-Munqidh, lit. "the deliverer" ), was the name used by the [[Fremen]] to describe their saviour in their messianic legend. The term equated roughly to ''"The one who will lead us to paradise".''

==History==
In conjunction with the wider Fremen legend of salvation, the Mahdi was also known to be an off-worlder (i.e. not a native of [[Arrakis]]), and the child of a [[Bene Gesserit]]. Thus, after [[Paul Atreides]] fell in with the Fremen and first displayed his [[prescience]] and fighting skills, many Fremen gradually began to see the young [[Duke]] as the Mahdi.

The legend associated with the Mahdi was at least partially influenced by a long-standing [[Panoplia Propheticus]] by the Bene Gesserit's [[Missionaria Protectiva]] wing. Lady Jessica noted that the Mahdi legend's presence on Arrakis was an indication of just how awful conditions there were, since it was reserved only for those cultures where a Bene Gesserit would need to assume total control.

Bela Tegeuse

'''Bela Tegeuse''' was the fifth planet in the Kuentsing star system.

It was reputed to be the third stopping place of the [[Zensunni]] forced migration.

While "Kuentsing" is often identified with Alpha or Beta Leporis, it in fact refers to the star Iota Leporis. The Chinese asterism of Kuentsing (army well) specifically refers to Iota, Kappa, Lambda, and Nu Leporis. Of these, Iota is the first in the sequence (1st army well) and is the most reasonable distance from Old Earth at 231.81 light years away.

It was later conquered by the [[Honored Matres]].

A '''prison planet''' is any planet where the entire world is dedicated to the incarceration of criminals. Under the rule of [[House Corrino]], the Imperial Prison Planet was designated [[Salusa Secundus]] after the removal of the royal court to [[Kaitain]].

During the rule of [[House Corrino]] nobles and loyalists of disgraced [[house]]s were exiled en masse to [[Tupile]], a mysterious prison planet which may in fact have been a collection of such worlds.

Murbella
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:318e9543c3c3b5ba8a9fdccfbba15016-1.jpg|thumb|from the Russian cover of ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'']]

'''Murbella''' was a promising young [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] who was captured by the [[Bene Gesserit]] and trained in the ways of the Sisterhood. She later became both the [[Mother Superior]] and the [[Great Honored Matre]], uniting the bitter enemies.

== History ==

===Early Life===
Murbella was raised as an Honored Matre from an early age. She was deemed to be a trainee of particular promise when it was revealed that she possessed physical and mental abilities far above average. Among these abilities were almost unimaginable reflexes, which ran independent of her central nervous system. As was common of females of Honoured Matre heritage, she also possessed the ability to amplify sexual ecstasy to near unimaginable levels.

===Capture===
During a stay in the city of [[Ysai]], Murbella captured a [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]] and attempted to imprint the Bene Gesserit loyalist. However, thanks to powerful abilities the Tleilaxu have secretly built into him, he was able to partially resist her, and instead imprint himself onto her psyche. Thus the pair became sexually addicted to one another.

When the pair later fell under the custody of the Bene Gesserit, the Sisterhood made good use of Idaho's new-found abilities (and addiction to Murbella) to extract some information from the vulnerable young Honored Matre, and later start her training as one of their own.

===Training===

Later, as the Honored Matre attacks intensified, Duncan Idaho and Murbella were living together in continued confinement on Chapterhouse. The intense sexual bond created by their mutual imprinting in has made them somewhat reluctant lovers. 

[[Darwi Odrade]], the new Leader of the Sisterhood, had decided to accelerate Murbella's training as a Bene Gesserit, despite some's belief in the organization that she intended to steal their secrets and escape back to the Honored Matres, who are now based near [[Junction]], and have just completely conquered [[Gammu]].

Murbella's training with the Bene Gesserit was protracted and often confrontational. However, their shrewd methods such as "word weapons" to undermine her earlier Matre identity, and use of her bond with Idaho enabled them to slowly turn her to their collective will. During this entire period, Murbella provided the Sisterhood with four daughters, uniting the [[genetics]] of Idaho and the Honored Matres into a powerful combination. As time went by, Murbella understood fully that she was an admirer of and wanted to be Bene Gesserit, and began to see her former Matres as ignorant. The words of her initiation are repeated with an emphasis on Bene Gesserit. 

Finally it was decided that Murbella was ready to become a [[Reverend Mother]]. Odrade relaxed the strictures, and for the first time ever, a man — Duncan — is allowed to watch a spice ceremony. Duncan was filled with trepidation, first because he feared Murbella would not survive the ritual, and second because he wondered whether she would still love him after going through such a life changing experience. Odrade watched with equal trepidation because Murbella was vital to her plan to deal with the Honored Matres, and to reform the Sisterhood. Odrade believed that the Bene Gesserit made a mistake in fearing emotion, and that in order to evolve, the Bene Gesserit must learn to accept emotions. Murbella, Odrade is pleased to find, took and survived the hard path to becoming a Reverend Mother.

Murbella went through a manic phase after becoming a Reverend Mother, and her feelings for Duncan were not the same — a fact that worries Odrade as much as Duncan. Whether it is a temporary effect of the experience or a permanent one was unknown.

===Union of the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres===

Odrade called a Convocation (a meeting of all the Bene Gesserit), and announced her plan to attack the Honored Matres on Junction. She told them that this attack would be led by Bashar [[Miles Teg]]. She also announced candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior, those being [[Sheeana]] and Murbella, and shared with them before she left.

The attack seemed headed for failure, and Murbella ordered a withdrawal, attempting to save as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she could. Odrade had already planned a contingency for the potential failure of the Bene Gesserit attack; she left Murbella instructions for a desperate gamble to attempt in a potential last stand situation. Murbella piloted a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit in the confusion of war. She claimed that she wants to share all of the Gesserit secrets that she had learned. When she arrived on the planet, she immediately announced her intentions by killing an overeager Honored Matre with a blinding speed enhanced by Bene Gesserit training.  This demonstrated that she was faster than any Honored Matre before her, as she had successfully fused the best abilities of both organizations.

Murbella was taken to the newest Great Honored Matre, [[Logno]], and immediately declared herself hostile. Logno could not help herself and attacked; Murbella killed her and many of her allies. Odrade was killed in the melee, but before Odrade died, Murbella shared with Odrade and took charge of the Honored Matres, who were awed by her physical prowess and her ability to see into [[Other Memory]].

Murbella's ascension to the leadership of the Honored Matres and, by necessity, the Bene Gesserit as well, was not accepted as victory by all of the Sisterhood. Some felt that she would suborn the spirit of the Bene Gesserit and many worried that her plan of merging the two orders into a New Sisterhood was doomed to failure. Some then decided to escape, notably Sheeana, who had a vision of her own. They invited Duncan Idaho and Miles Teg to join them and all fled Chapterhouse in a giant no-ship, with its previous passengers, [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale]] and the Jews of [[Gammu]], still aboard. Murbella recognized their plan, but too late to stop them; she might have opted to permit it anyway, as Duncan's departure solved many problems for her new role as leader.

Distrans
{{Original}}
[[File:Cielago-by-randy-asplund.jpg|thumb]]


'''Distrans''' refers to a technology by which information could be implanted in animals for storage and retrieval.

The information was stored subliminally by voice. The message could be retrieved from the [[animal]] by uttering a word or phrase. The message would usually be repeated by the animal as a series of words uttered through vibrations. The sound was likened to words connected by a series of hums.

The [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]], and presumably [[assassin]]s used distrans animals extensively as a form of covert communication. Typically, [[birds]] were the most common form of distrans employed in the days of the old [[Imperium]]. [[Bats]] were especially useful, as they could travel under the cover of night.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In a scene from [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune Messiah (novel)|''Dune Messiah'']], the dwarf [[Bijaz]], a product of the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]], was employed as a human distrans, as was the [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale]]. At the time it was considered to be inappropriate and robbed humans of their dignity. It also served as a plot point to demonstrate further reasons behind people's disdain for the [[Bene Tleilax]], as they used humans in perverse ways.

Windtrap
{{Original}}

[[File:51mqGsm5DyL-1.jpg|thumb]]

On the planet [[Arrakis]], a '''windtrap''' was a facility designed to reclaim the moisture in the air and funnel it to large [[catchbasin]]s for later use by the [[Fremen]].

The air of Arrakis was usually hot and dry. However, at night, when the air cooled, some moisture would develop. This moisture would then be carried by winds across the surface of the planet. Essentially a large air intake, the windtraps would capture this air so that the moisture could be extracted from it by the Fremen, after it condensed.

Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] incorporated the windtraps into his terraforming program. However, he had surmised that the water reclaimed from this system would not be enough, and that a self-sustaining precipitation system would need to exist. As a result, he began a plantation drive across the planet.

In ''Dune ''video games, Windtraps provide energy and water to the base's buildings and personnel, ensuring power for radar, and certain weapons. 

- ''Dune II ''windtraps reduce corrosive damage to structures caused by the harsh environment, and powers the radar screen, yet, the zone map was still visible without radar, and neither weapon system requires power to operate.

- ''Dune 2000 ''windtraps are more important, the nominal power level is always 100% or above. Without power, the radar outpost could not operate, so the radar screen is not available. Production and building speed decreases, Rocket Turrets will not work without sufficient power, and Death Hand missile will not progress.

Rakian Priesthood
{{Original}}{{Cleanup}}[[File:14-P-1.jpg|thumb|Dune:Chapterhouse book cover]]

The '''Rakian Priesthood''' was a priestly body that worshipped the [[Divided God]], [[Leto Atreides II]]. They ruled [[Arrakis|Rakis]] during the time the [[Lost Ones]] were returning from [[The Scattering]], approximately 1500 years after Leto II's death. They were presumably descendants of the [[Qizarate]].

== Theological Beliefs ==

[[File:Img171.jpg|thumb|Cania - Illustration by Klaus D.Schiemann]]

The Rakian Priesthood maintained that both [[Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]] and his son Leto II were hallowed, and that Leto was God Himself. Their canon detailed how, after his death, Leto divided into the [[sandworm]]s and became [[Shaitan]], hence the term "Divided God".

== Rule and Later Annihilation ==

[[File:873816-1.jpg|thumb|Priestly towers on Rakis]]

The Rakian Priesthood ruled over Rakis after Leto's death. Their rule was brutal, often marked with random executions by sending people into the desert to be taken by sandworms. However, despite their rule being harsh, the Priesthood was largely populated with individuals who lacked insight but possessed ambition.

At the time of the discovery of [[Sheeana]], the Priesthood was led by [[Hasmar Tuek]], a descendant of [[Esmar Tuek]]. However, Tuek was eventually killed by the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] and replaced with a [[Face Dancers|Face Dancer]], with the approval of the [[Bene Gesserit]]. However, the Face Dancer eventually came to believe that he was Tuek.

The entire Rakian Priesthood was annihilated, along with the planet's population, when the surface of Rakis was sterilised by the [[Honored Matres]]. They had come to be known as a troublesome, ignorant group by other powers in the [[Old Imperium]], including the Bene Gesserit, the [[Fish Speakers]], and the Bene Tleilax.

'''Fedaykin''' was originally a word used to describe the [[Fremen]]'s guerrilla fighters, and was later used in reference to [[Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]]'s personal guard—his death commandos. By the time [[Leto II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]] were born, the term Fedaykin had become synonymous with the elite of Muad'dib's Jihad army.

However, after Paul was blinded and vanished into the [[Arrakis]] desert, the Fedaykin's fortunes faltered. In 10,210 [[A.G.]] [[Alia Atreides]] dissolved the Fedaykin, and the term reverted to its original Fremen meaning.

==Etymology==
The word "Fedaykin" is derived from the Arabic word [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=fedayeen Fedayeen] which denotes a member of an Arab commando group.

Imperial Conditioning
{{Original}}


[[File:51ejsbUxz0L-1.jpg|thumb]]

'''Imperial Conditioning''' was a development of the Suk Medical Schools. It was the highest conditioning against taking human life, which meant that a [[Suk Doctor]] who had this conditioning could even serve an [[Emperor]].

Initiates were marked by a diamond tattoo on the forehead and were permitted to wear their hair long and bound by a silver Suk ring.

The conditioning against taking human life had remained a stalwart of the Suk school for millennia. However, a way was found by [[House Harkonnen]] agent [[Piter de Vries]] to break this conditioning. De Vries realised that a person, even a Suk doctor, could be made to do another's bidding if one of their loved ones was held hostage. In this way, he was able to control [[Wellington Yueh]] into betraying his Duke, [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]], and deliver him to Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]].

Though Suk Doctors continued to exist even into the time of [[Leto Atreides II]] and later amongst [[The Scattering]], it could be surmised that the Suk School lost much of its prestige from this time onward or that their Conditioning was considered ineffective at the very least.

==Behind the Scenes==

Most adaptions fall short in explaining how exactly de Vries managed to break Yueh's imperial conditioning and simply rely on him being blackmailed by the Harkonnens, however the very point of imperial conditioning was to make such manipulation by blackmail, bribery or pressure all but impossible. Even in the book itself it is indicated that de Vries or at least the Baron, himself was not fully aware on how they had managed to overwrite Yueh's conditioning. De Vries seems to have created a necessity for Baron Harkonnen's death in Yueh's mind, however as Yueh's own conditioning prevented him from doing so by himself, De Vries' counter-conditioning pressed Yueh into a situation in which the death of Baron Harkonnen by the hands of another needed to be arranged -this other however could be none else but Duke Leto. In a way in this counter-conditioning the treason on Leto was just a by-product and the necessity of Leto's death to bring forth Baron Harkonnen's death enabled Yueh to overcome his original conditioning and commit treason. De Vries had used the Baron himself as means to transmit Yueh's conditioning against killing into a conditioning of the need to arrange the circumstances of a target's certain death -a fact De Vries never had openly revealed to his master.

The [[Dune Encyclopedia]] also addresses the problem and mentions a number of in-world explanations for example the theory that Yueh was indeed a fake-Suk and in truth a trained and conditioned [[Assassin]], or that Yuehs Wife [[Wanna]] had conditioned her husband to protect her life so Yuehs mind was fighting with two contradicting conditionings of which the [[Bene Gesserit]] proved to be the stronger one. A third theory finally comes to the conclusion that the Suk-conditioning was in fact in its core flawed to begin with and relied much more on self-deception and its own myth than reality.

Stone burner
{{Original}}

[[File:Stoneburner.png|thumb]]

The '''stone burner''' was a particularly destructive weapon. It could perform o­ne of two tasks; the first function of the bomb was to release massive amounts of J-rays (a type of radiation that dissolves eye tissue), thus blinding all creatures within a certain radius. The second objective was to create general destruction of property.

== Technical Description ==

[[File:Stoneburner2.png|thumb]]


After the device was activated it would set off an explosion that arced straight up and down. The explosive yield would be determined by the person(s) who set up the device, as well as the size of its power source. Should the party wish it, the stone burner could explode down to the core of the planet. The resulting sudden release of the planets inner magma would tear the world apart.

== Legal Classification ==

[[File:Stoneburner3.png|thumb]]


Despite its massive power, the stone burner was not considered an [[atomics|atomic]] weapon. Its fuel source was atomic, however. A stone burner would first detonate an atomic within it, and then collect the energy to use for its other devastating tasks.

== Usage ==

[[File:Stoneburner4.png|thumb]]


During the days of the [[Imperium]], the issue of stone burners was a controversial one. According to [[the Great Convention]], o­nly [[House|Great Houses]] could possess atomics. Thus, someone who did not belong to a Great House could own a stone-burner, but they could not possess its fuel.

The Great Convention also forbade the use of weapons of mass destruction such as atomics and stone burners against humans directly. However, there were times when this prohibition was circumvented or outright disobeyed.

Emperor [[Paul Atreides]] was blinded by a stone burner during an attack on him and his [[Fedaykin]]. While this attack did not kill Paul or his men, it left them blinded. Earlier, when the [[Fremen]] were attacking [[Naraj]] during Muad'dib's [[Second Crusade]], the Naraj defenders used a stone burner to blind the attacking Fremen but not to kill them. The legality of this action was vague at best.

==Apocrypha==

[[File:Stoneburner5.png|thumb]]

In [[Dune II]] and its sequels the [[Devastator]]s were inspired by the Books Stone burner.

Stillsuit
{{Original}}
[[File:Dune 2020 - Empire - Jessica, Chani, Stilgar, Paul.jpg|thumb|right|Stillsuits (''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]'', 2021)]]
A '''stillsuit''' is a full body suit worn in the open desert of the planet [[Arrakis]] that was designed to preserve the body's moisture. It consisted of various layers that would absorb the body's moisture through sweating and urination, and then filter the impurities so that drinkable water would be circulated to catchpockets. The individual could then drink the reclaimed water from a tube attached to the neck. A stillsuit, kept in working order and maintained properly, permitted the wearer to survive for weeks in the open desert.

== Design ==

[[File:Stillsuit (art by Matt Howarth, The Dune Encyclopedia).png|thumb|Stillsuit (illustration in ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'', art by [[Matt Howarth]])]]


The stillsuit typically covered the entire body, up to the neck and wrists. For the hands, gloves could be worn. However, when delicate work was performed, Fremen discarded the gloves and rubbed their hands with leaves from the [[creosote bush]]. This allowed them to work, while the residue from the creosote leaves prevented perspiration.

A facial mask could also be worn so that moisture from the mouth and face could also be reclaimed.

As the planetologist [[Liet Kynes]] is assisting Duke [[Leto Atreides I |Leto ]]Atreides I with the fitting of his stillsuit, he explains the suit in this manner:

''"It's basically a micro-sandwich — a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system. The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body ... near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers . . . include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed. Motions of the body, especially breathing and some osmotic action provide the pumping force. Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck... Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to ensure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day..."''

== Manufacture ==

[[File:Dune-Stilgar-Stillsuit-4.jpg|thumb]]

During the time of the [[Faufreluches]], stillsuits were manufactured by [[Fremen]] as well as private entrepreneurs. However, Fremen-manufactured stillsuits were widely considered the highest in quality, as they were the only ones that could preserve the body's moisture in the deep desert. Only an average of a thimbleful of water (2-5 ml) a day was lost when a Fremen stillsuit was worn.

== Use ==
Fremen stillsuit discipline was very strict. Since an individual's body water belonged to the tribe, it was everybody's personal responsibility to preserve as much of their water as possible. Moreover, when crossing the [[Deep Desert]], utter adherence to maximum stillsuit discipline was the only way one would have a chance of surviving. While in [[sietch]], stillsuit discipline was more relaxed.

One of the measures of the progress of Arrakis' transformation from a desert planet to a lush world was when [[Fremen]] no longer required to wear stillsuits in the open air.

Hunter-seeker
{{Original}}
The '''hunter-seeker''' was a deadly tool used by assassins. The tiny floating tadpole-like machine was remotely controlled by an operator situated close by.

In 1981's ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Emperor_of_Dune God Emperor of Dune]'', [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leto_II_Atreides Leto II Atreides] can see through his [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescience prescience] that his [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Path_(Dune) Golden Path] has prevented the Ixians from being the cause of humanity's destruction in the future. Leto's Golden Path has prevented a future in which the Ixians released, and ultimately lost control of, self improving [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-seeker Hunter-Seekers] that would eventually consume all organic life in the known universe.

'''''Velocity: '''''up to 25 meters per second

'''''Length: '''''1 centimeter

'''''Mass: '''''Negligible

'''''Range: '''''up to 50 meters

'''''Ammunition: '''''1 hour of use

== Operation and Technology ==
The device floated through the air, using a tiny [[Holtzman Effect|Holtzman Field Generator]] to maneuver. The tip held a camera that transmitted a video signal back to the operator. Vision was distorted by the compressed suspensor field. Once detected, the target was almost guaranteed to be killed.

The killing device itself was a tiny needle, tipped with a quick-acting, lethal [[:Category:Poisons|poison]]. The needle was retracted until a target is acquired, at which point it appeared, shortly before the device shot into the victim.

== Counteraction ==
Destroying a Hunter-seeker was rather simple. Like any machine, it could be destroyed by being smashed or submerged in water. [[Paul Atreides]] employed both means to destroy a Hunter-seeker that had been launched to kill him on [[Arrakis]], shortly before the invasion of [[House Harkonnen]].

[[File:August1.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Sietchmap1.jpg|thumb|Sietch -map by dysonlogos.com]]

{{Quote|The sietch at the desert rim was Liet's, was Kynes's, was Stilgar's, was Muad'Dib's, and, once more, was Stilgar's. The Naibs one by one sleep in the sand, but the sietch endures.|from a [[Fremen]] song|Children of Dune}}

The term '''Sietch''' was the [[Fremen]] term for a community or village.

== Location ==
A sietch was typically located within the mountains or rock outcrops that were scattered throughout the deserts of [[Arrakis]], hidden from the harsh sun [[Stars# Alpha Carinae|Canopus]]. It was located within either a man-made or a naturally carved cave system, or occasionally a combination of both.

The actual size of the mountains and rock outcrops had to be quite large as was the network of tunnels and caves. It had to be capable of not only housing the hundreds or even thousands Fremen families, but also large enough to house all the internal economies and industries, basically a small city and all the civic necessities that would be needed even for a minimalist society like the Fremen community. Stillsuit manufacturing, processing spice and converting it into fibrous form, small scale farming, food processing, as well as the tribe's water storage, water reclamation facilities and power supply, seem to be common to most if not all sietch communities.

== Infrastructure ==
The physical infrastructure of a sietch consisted of living and ceremonial quarters. It was governed by a [[Naib]], and was constantly guarded, primarily from any hostile off-world humans.

Most Fremen living within a sietch would share much. However, some privacy was allowed, especially when it came to spending time with the family. As such, a Fremen and his family would usually be assigned a small number of rooms within the sietch. This was referred to as his ''[[yali]]''. When a Fremen died, his yali typically went to his son, unless he died in the [[Tahaddi Challenge]], in which case the yali went to the victor.

Some sietches, such as [[Sietch Tabr]], also housed a stunted [[sandworm]] for [[Water of Life]] rituals. It would also be where the [[spice orgy]] would occur.

In practice Sietches could be quite different types of settlements, a Sietch would normally include [[Windtrap]]s, [[Yali]]s, condensers, ''Sietch-schools'', corridors, ''sietch-factories'', [[dew collector]]s, [[stillsuit shops]], manufactures, [[field generator]]s, animal dens, ''landing lips'', plantings, caverns, ''small maker caches'', warrens, watches, seals, ''moisture traps'', entraces, shelters, fuel cells, assembly chambers, ''sietch gardens'', catch-basins, ''exvaporation-proof basins'', ''mega-basins'', Watertraps, [[Qanat]]s,storage basins, decoy barrages, [[Deathstill]]s. Many of the more southern Sietches were Palmaries or Oasises and during the time of Muad'dib's Rebellion many Sietch villages were turned into "Sietch-fortresses".

== Etymology ==
The term '''Sietch''' originally meant ''"place of assembly in time of danger"'', (and possibly held some relevance to the word ''siege''). Compare with the ''sich ''(Ukrainian січ), the chief fortress refuge settlement of the Ukrainian cossacks of Old Earth. However, due to the constantly threatened nature of [[Fremen]] life, the term evolved into a general term for a communal gathering.

==Behind the scenes==
It is worth noting the similarity between Sietch and "Seeq", which is one of the Arabic names of the ancient desert town of Petra, accessible only via a narrow passage. Notice the similarities in the structure, and the name.

The word appears once in the narrative of ''[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]'' to describe the shelter of [[Naib Dhartha]]'s tribe. However it is not mentioned in dialogue therefore it is not clear if the word indeed was spoken during the time of the [[Butlerian Jihad]].

Mapes
{{Original}}

[[File:Tumblr_nduls1FDVf1sndzdgo4_1280-1.png|thumb]]

The [[Shadout]] '''Mapes''' was the head housekeeper in the Imperial Residence in the city of [[Arrakeen]] on the planet [[Arrakis]] when the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] took control of that planet in 10,191AG.

Mapes was one of the first [[Fremen]] that many of the Atreides encountered on a personal basis when they arrived on Arrakis. Mapes had approached the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] in the hopes of determining if she was the one the Fremen prophecies spoke of. In turn, Jessica managed to learn a great deal from Mapes regarding Fremen superstitions and legends implanted on Arrakis by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]]. In true Fremen fashion, Mapes kept a [[crysknife]] concealed on her person. However, when she determined that the Lady Jessica was indeed the [[Bene Gesserit]] the Fremen legends spoke of, she gave the [[knife]] to Jessica, who kept it on her thereafter.

Shortly thereafter, Mapes was almost killed by a [[Hunter Seeker]] meant for the [[Duke|Ducal]] Heir, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. In return for saving her life, Mapes informed Paul that the Fremen were aware that a traitor was among them. However, she did not know their identity.

Pardot Kynes
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Pardo_&_Liet.jpg|thumb]]


'''Pardot Kynes''' [d. 10175 AG] was an Imperial [[Planetologist]] who studied [[Arrakis]]. He remained there and married a native [[Fremen]] woman, with whom he had his only child, [[Liet Kynes]].

Kynes was the first to be sent to study Arrakis, perhaps by [[Elrood Corrino IX]]. For Kynes, the planet was an expression of its [[Canopus|sun]]'s energy, ready to be reshaped

==Meeting with the Fremen==

[[File:Screenshot_2019-07-26-03-08-39-1.png|thumb]]

His opportunity to shape the planet came when he was exploring the landscape in a one-man [[groundcar]] behind the [[Shield Wall]], near the village of [[Windsack]], one hot afternoon when he stumbled onto six [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] bravos, [[shield]]ed and fully armed, bullying 3 [[Fremen]] youths. It was a common scene, more slapstick than real, but Kynes realized that the bullies intended to kill the boys; one was down with a severed artery, two of the bravos were down, but it was still four armed men against two.

Kynes triggered his own shield, waded in and had silently had two of the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip. He dodged a [[sword]] thrust, slit the third's throat with a neat entrisseur, and the remaining Harkonnen was felled by the two Fremen youths, as he saved the lad on the ground.

The Fremen were confused; he was a known Imperial servant, but was also an ally. The inexperienced youths by two days later, took him to Windshack owing him a mortal obligation. There he talked to the Fremen about water, grass, about palmaries filled with date palms and open qanats flowing across the desert.

Kynes never saw the behind-the-scenes debate raging all around him. He knew the location of a major sietch and talked like a madman, he was a water burden for the sietch and also a servant of the Imperium. He did kill Harkonnens but anyone had; he just saved three fool youths and had seen [[crysknives]]. Eventually the [[tau]] of the sietch voiced the decision.

Kynes was talking to a group that spread around him about open water, walking in the open without [[stillsuit]]s, and [[portyguls]], when [[Uliet]], an experienced fighter, was sent with a consecrated [[knife]] to kill him, with two [[watermen]] to get his water from the body. Kynes said "Remove yourself" to Uliet who stood before him, and went on talking about secret [[windtrap]]s, brushing past the man opening his for his ceremonial blow.

Uliet inexplicably, in a riddling gesture, perhaps motivated by Kynes' visionary words, walked three paces and deliberately fell on his own knife, thus "removing" himself.
=== Terraforming Arrakis ===


[[File:Pardotkynes.png|thumb|Pardot Kynes, by Dev Pramanik and Alex Guimarães, House Atreides Graphic novel ]]


This was taken to be a sign by the Fremen that Kynes was to be listened to. Eventually, most Fremen took to Kynes' vision for Arrakis' future. Kynes returned to his Imperial post, directing the [[Biological Testing Station]] bringing Fremen as personnel, stealing tools like [[cutteray]]s, used to dig underground [[catchbasin]]s and hidden windtraps and collect water in the basins.

Kynes was hailed as an [[umma]], a prophet. Men, women and children went anywhere he ordered, and many died during their "missions". He set up small-unit experiments with regular interchange of data for a swift [[Tansley effect]], accumulating millions of tiny information. He organized only isolated and rough run-through tests to put their difficulties into perspective.

Kynes had the Fremen collect copious amounts of data on the climate, biology and ecosystems of the planet. Through his research, [[sandtrout]] were discovered. Indeed, it was through the sandtrout that Kynes learned the relationship between the spice and [[Shai-hulud]].

After discovering how melange was created, Pardot Kynes turned his attention to planting greenery. First he began with a certain [[poverty grass]], then moved to others including:
* [[Poverty grass]]
* Ephemerals - [[chenopods]], [[pigweed]]s, [[amarinth]]
* [[Scotch broom]]
* [[Low lupine]]
* [[Vine eucalyptus]] (from [[Caladan]])
* [[Dwarf tamarisk]]
* [[Shore pine]]
* [[Candelilla]]
* [[Suguaro]]
* [[Bis-naga]]
* Shrubs and bushes, including [[camel sage]], [[onion grass]], [[gobi feather grass]], [[wild alfalfa]], [[burrow Bush]], [[sand verbena]], [[evening primrose]], [[incense bush]], [[smoke tree]], [[creosote bush]].

Following this, Kynes then introduced various animals, including:
* Burrowing animals: [[kit fox]], [[kangaroo mouse]], [[desert hare]], [[sand terrapin]]
* Predators, including the [[desert hawk]], [[dwarf owl]], [[eagle]], [[desert owl]]
* Insects, namely [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], [[trapdoor spider]], [[biting wasp]], [[wormfly]]
* The [[desert bat]]

Once Kynes saw the introduction of all these forms of life, he then began to plant more than two hundred different food plants, including [[cotton]], [[melon]]s, [[coffee]] and [[medicinal]]s.

Kynes married into a Fremen sietch and had a son, [[Liet Kynes]] whom he taught (along with the other Fremen children) ecology and the "language" of Arrakis, of its landscape, climate, seasonal limits, and finally how to break through all ideas of force into the awareness of order.

===Death===
However, he was killed in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] when Liet was nineteen. Liet continued his father's work, both in an official capacity as Imperial Planetologist, but also as Fremen leader, steering them as a people toward an ultimate goal, one that Pardot Kynes had envisioned would take approximately five hundred years. This plan, however, was interrupted and dramatically quickened by the arrival of [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]].

==Character==
Kynes was a direct and simple man in many ways. His single-mindedness was enormous, and approached any problem with a kind of innocence, but not naïveté; he merely permitted himself no distractions. Thus, he often appeared somewhat emotionless, but was kind and helpful nonetheless. His son Liet inherited both his mother's Fremen nature and his father's ecological talent and thus he was more emotional than Pardot.

Wormsign
{{Original}}
[[File:Wormsign.jpg|thumb]]
'''Wormsign''' is a tell-tale signal which indicates that a sandworm was approaching. It usually manifested itself as static charges on the surface of sand dunes. When the sandworm reached a shallow depth, a surge in the sands appeared. The observation of wormsign usually meant that a sandworm's estimated time of arrival could be calculated by skilled watchers.

Wild Atreides genes
{{original}}

[[File:Childrenofdunehebrew.png|thumb|Children of Dune cover art (hebrew edition)]]

'''Wild Atreides genes''' is a common statement/lament of [[Bene Gesserit]] concerning the unpredictable and mostly dangerous abilities held within the [[Atreides]] bloodline. This wildness has manifested in [[Paul Atreides]], his son [[The Tyrant]](Leto II), [[Darwi Odrade]], [[Miles Teg]], and [[Siona Atreides]]. The final [[Duncan Idaho]] also had some [[Atreides]] genes within him that continued through his many lives and past the events of [[God Emperor of Dune (novel)]].  These genes came from the constant resurrection of the Idaho [[Gholas]] during the reign of [[The Tyrant]] and his breedings with Atreides' scions, most notably Siona Atreides.

In the [[Old Empire]] Draconis 4 was also known as [[Ishkal]] and was one of several waystations of the [[Wandering Zensunni]].

Eventually a couple of several wealthy indigenious families evolved into one large cartel which could acclaim the status of a [[Great House]] due to their economic success as Merchants and Financiers.

A male sex slave with attractive eyes was purchased by [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], the head of the infamous [[House Harkonnen]], during a visit there.

The world was later conquered by the [[Honored Matres]], prior to their merger with the [[Bene Gesserit]].

Guild Heighliners were usually immense in size, easily accommodating many thousands of passengers, whole fleets of smaller vessels, and the vast export of planetary goods.

Spacing Guild Heighliners could be used to fold space to travel vast distances across the universe in an instant. They were piloted by [[Guild Navigator]]s and [[Steersman|Steersmen]].

Ramallo
{{Original}}

'''Ramallo''' was the [[Fremen]] [[Sayyadina]], or rogue [[Reverend Mother]] of [[Sietch Tabr]]. She lived during the time [[House Atreides]] came to administer [[Arrakis]] under [[Imperium|Imperial]] decree in 10,191AG.

Ramallo was a Fremen woman who had taken the [[Water of Life]] and changed it successfully, thus unlocking her [[Other Memory]]. She was a mother figure and a woman of wisdom for the Fremen of Sietch Tabr. Upon their arrival, she accepted [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]], a [[Bene Gesserit]] adept, and her son Paul, offering them both cryptic advice about the future.

When the Fremen of Sietch Tabr were forced to move deeper into the desert in response to increasing Harkonnen aggression, Ramallo declared that she was too old to survive the journey. Jessica succeeded Ramallo, who died just as Jessica successfully changed the Water of Life.

It has been speculated, due to her behavior and her portrayal in the 2000 miniseries (Jessica refers to her as "one of our missionaries"), that Ramallo may have been an actual Bene Gesserit who had gone rogue, as opposed to simply occupying a position set up by the Sisterhood's [[Missionaria Protectiva]], who had planted myths and legends on Arrakis eons before the arrival of the Atreides. However, no direct evidence for this theory exists.

Chani Kynes

'''Chani Kynes''' [d. [[10210 AG]]], also known by her intimate name '''Sihaya''' (meaning ''Desert Spring''), was the [[Fremen]] bound [[concubine]] of [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]]. With the Emperor, she mothered [[Leto Atreides II the Elder]], [[God-Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]] the Younger, and [[Ghanima Atreides]].

==History==
=== Upbringing ===
Chani was born on [[Arrakis]], the daughter of the half-[[Fremen]] planetologist [[Liet Kynes]] and his full-[[Fremen]] wife. She gradually developed into a formidable fighter, and by the time of her father's death was serving under [[naib]] [[Stilgar]].

=== Introduction and Life with Paul ===
When [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and his mother [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] escaped from [[Arrakeen]] after the invasion of [[House Harkonnen]] they quickly found themselves in the deep desert of [[Arrakis]]. There, while sheltering in a cave system from a [[sandworm]] they were intercepted by a group of traveling [[Fremen]], which included Chani.

Her introduction to [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] came during a tense stand-off. Chani was familiar to the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] heir because of her appearance in his prescient visions prior to his arrival on [[Arrakis]]. But to her [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] was initially a stranger.

After the integration of [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] into the [[Fremen]] by [[Stilgar]], Chani began her long-lasting love affair with the young Duke, and eventually bore him a son, [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|Leto]]. However, their first born was murdered by a [[House Corrino]] raiding party while [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], Chani and [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] were away visiting another [[sietch]].

After the defeat of [[House Harkonnen]] and [[House Corrino]] on [[Arrakis]], and [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] subsequent ascent to Emperor and marriage to [[Irulan Corrino]], Chani became his official concubine and remained his exclusive partner.

=== Pregnancy and Death ===
Twelve years later, when Chani became pregnant once again, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]] sought to usurp her and become the bearer of [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] children. She found support with the [[Bene Gesserit]], who feared the impact of Chani's largely-unknown bloodline on their breeding program.

However, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan's]] attempts to terminate Chani's pregnancy through drugs failed. After a traumatic pregnancy, (the pregnancy was accelerated by Spice, taking only five months instead of nine) Chani gave birth to twins, who [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] named [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]].

[[Irulan Corrino|Irulan's]] treachery did, however, bring a secondary result. Chani died shortly after giving birth to the twins, due to complications stemming from the drugs [[Paul Atreides|Paul's]] titular wife had been surreptitiously feeding her.

The [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Scytale]] offered immediately to resurrect Chani in an [[Axlotl Tanks|Axlotl Tank]]. Yet despite the temptation, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] refused, knowing the impact such an event would have on the [[Golden Path]].


==Physical appearance==
Chani was described as skinny with an elfin face and had pure, dark blue eyes with no white in them. She had long tawny-red hair.

Missionaria Protectiva
{{Original}}
[[File:Missionaria.jpg|thumb|The Missionaria Protectiva as depicted in the [[Dune Trading Card Game]].]]
The '''Missionaria Protectiva''' was the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood's "black arm of superstition", responsible for sowing the seeds of superstition in primitive cultures, so that the Sisterhood could take advantage of them when those seeds grew to full-fledged legends. They were responsible for spreading the [[Panoplia Propheticus]] (myths, prophecies, and superstitions).

This "religious engineering" spread "infectious superstitions on primitive worlds, thus opening those regions to exploitation by the Bene Gesserit." Panoplia Prophetica provide the opportunity for a Bene Gesserit to later cast herself as a guide, protector, or some other figure in fulfillment of a prophecy in order to manipulate the religious subjects for protection or other purposes. These myths also exploit religion as a powerful force in human society; by controlling the particulars of religion, the Bene Gesserit have a manipulative lever on society in general. The Bene Gesserit also employ the Missionaria Protectiva to prepare the Empire for the arrival of the Kwisatz Haderach.

==Arrakis==

The superstitions maintained by the [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] detailed the coming of a [[prescience|prescient]] son of a Bene Gesserit who would lead them to freedom. This son is referred to as the [[Lisan al Gaib]] in Fremen myth. And it is this son that will become the [[Mahdi]] of the Fremen and lead them to freedom. Thus, when [[House Atreides]] arrived on [[Arrakis]] in [[10191 AG]], the Fremen believed that the prophecies handed down to them through the ages by the Missionaria Protectiva were being fulfilled.

Jessica and Paul take refuge among the Fremen after the attack on House Atreides. With his mother's guidance, Paul is able to make use of the planted myths by claiming to be "Mahdi", a messianic figure from legendary material planted among the Fremen by the Missionaria Protectiva. That the Mahdi legend has been planted on Dune indicates to Jessica that conditions on Dune are truly awful, since this legend is reserved for only the harshest environments where a Bene Gesserit would need the maximum advantage over surrounding influences. Paul's meteoric rise to power is greatly facilitated by his association with the Mahdi legend. Indeed, this appeared to be the case, as [[Paul Atreides]], the son of a Bene Gesserit, became the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], delivered the Fremen from subjugation, and spread a [[Muad'dib's Jihad]] across the universe.

Later, the Bene Gesserit plan to use Reverend Mother [[Sheeana]]'s ability to control the great [[sandworm]]s to build her into a religious figure around whom they can fashion a mass devoted following, uniting many factions in the universe under the Bene Gesserit and against the forces of [[the Scattering]]. This plan would have taken advantage of the groundwork laid by the Missionaria Protectiva thousands of years earlier.


{{expanded}}

After the emergence of the [[New Sisterhood]], the Missionaria was changed by order of [[Mother Commander]] [[Murbella]]. The new name was ''Missionaria Aggressiva''.

Farad'n Corrino
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[Image:Faradn1-CoD.jpg|thumb|Farad'n Corrino as portrayed by actor Jonathan Bruun]] '''Prince Farad'n Corrino''', also known by his pen name '''''Harq al-Ada''''', was the son of [[Wensicia Corrino]], and the grandson of the deposed Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]]. He was best remembered as being the official scribe of the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] Empire, and the exclusive concubine to [[Padishah Empress]] [[Ghanima Atreides]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Farad'n was the son of Shaddam's daughter [[Wensicia Corrino]] and Dalak (a relative of Count Fenring). By the time Farad'n had reached childhood [[House Corrino|House Corrino's]] rule over the Imperium had ended. He was raised on [[Salusa Secundus]], the home of the dethroned House. His domineering and ambitious mother, intent on using her talented son to reclaim the Golden Lion Throne, pushed him hard in his education. By the time he had reached adolescence, Farad'n's relationship with [[Wensicia Corrino|Wensicia]] was strained and difficult.

Farad'n's upbringing involved training in [[Sardaukar]] ways. His principal instructor was [[Tyekanik]], a Sardaukar [[Bashar]]. The Sardaukar hoped that Farad'n would be the one to restore them to glory, despite his tendency for bookishness and philosophical introspection. Indeed for most of his adolescence and young adulthood, Farad'n had preferred to spend most of his time on his own hobbies and personal pursuits. He studied law and government, as well as philosophy. He studied Atreides law closely, in the hopes of learning how they managed to defeat the Corrinos.

Farad'n was also trained briefly in the [[Bene Gesserit]] ways by the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]]. It appeared that Jessica managed to reach the young man and develop his potential in ways his own mother had not. Jessica's mode of teaching helped to draw contrasts with his mother, whom Farad'n increasingly saw as a hindrance to his ascendancy to statesmanship, and not an advantage. Jessica's teachings allowed Farad'n to conclude that his mother's schemes to ascend him to the imperial throne were ham-fisted, clumsy, short-sighted and distasteful. This is evidenced by his expression of anger and disgust when learning of his mother's plot to kill the Atreides twins [[Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] using [[Laza tigers]].

=== Harq al-Ada ===
Despite his mother's best efforts, Farad'n possessed none of the ambition, vindictiveness or desire for vengeance inherent in his mother. As a result, he refused to cooperate with her plans, and had her banished to an isolated area of Salusa Secundus. Consequently, through the Lady Jessica's teachings in the Bene Gesserit ways Farad'n found himself an integral part of Leto II's [[Golden Path]]. He was designated the exclusive concubine of [[Ghanima Atreides]], so that both noble bloodlines could be merged to seed future generations, and so that the obedience of the Sardaukar, who remained loyal to House Corrino, could be assured.

Farad'n became the official scribe of the [[Atreides Empire]], writing under the pen name given to him by Leto, ''Harq al-Ada'', meaning 'the one who changes customs' in Arabic. Although Farad'n theoretically superseded his aunt Irulan (who devoted much of her life to documenting the histories of the Corrinos and Atreides), her works remained seminal.

[[Image:Wensicia2.jpg|thumb|Wensicia, portrayed by Susan Sarandon.]]

'''Wensicia Corrino''' was the third daughter of [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] and [[Anirul Corrino|Lady Anirul]]. She married [[Dalak Fenring]] and gave birth to [[Farad'n Corrino]]. After Shaddam's defeat by Muad'Dib and the [[Fremen]], she followed her family into exile on [[Salusa Secundus]].

==Exile==
Attempting to prepare her son for rule she ordered [[Sardaukar]] [[bashar]] [[Tyekanik]] as his principal instructor. She even ordered him to follow the religion of Muad'Dib, hoping that Farad'n would see the benefit of controlling his new Imperium by manipulating religious belief.

By [[10219 AG]], she had put a spy [[Javid]], as [[Alia Atreides]]' lover. Soon after Wensicia attempted an assassination of [[Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides]]. The plot involved providing Ghanima and her brother with a royal gift of fine cloaks which a pair of servo-controlled [[laza tiger]]s had been trained to recognize as prey during conditioning exercises using similar dressed human twins on Salusa Secundus. The plot, which ultimately failed, was revealed to Farad'n only afterwards and he found the use of human children to train the tigers distasteful. When word spread that Leto Atreides II had apparently been killed by the tigers and Ghanima seriously injured, the [[Bene Gesserit]] filed a formal protest against House Corrino through [[Sabit Rekush]] of the [[Landsraad]] [[Internal Security Commission]].

When [[Jessica Atreides]] escaped to Salusa Secundus, she became Farad'n's Bene Gesserit trainer. Jessica's mode of teaching helped him to draw contrasts with his mother, whom Farad'n increasingly saw as a hindrance to his ascendancy to statesmanship, and not an advantage.

He concluded that his mother's schemes to ascend him to the imperial throne were ham-fisted, clumsy, short-sighted and distasteful. This is evidenced by his expression of anger and disgust when learning of his mother's plot to kill the Atreides twins.

Despite his mother's best efforts, Farad'n possessed none of the ambition, vindictiveness or desire for vengeance inherent in his mother. As a result, he refused to cooperate with her plans, and had her banished to an isolated area of Salusa Secundus.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In the miniseries, ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'', Wensicia was portrayed by Susan Sarandon and was seemingly reimagined as being older than Irulan (Sarandon is 27 years older than Julie Cox, who played Irulan).

'''Lampadas''' was a notable planet in the Imperium.

Shortly after the conclusion of the [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]], a remote marshland area of Lampadas was selected by [[Gilbertus Albans]] as the original location of the [[Mentat/XD|Mentat School]].

15 millennia later, Lampadas was the site of a [[Bene Gesserit]] Keep and was the site of their main educational and library facilities. Lampadas was one of the many planets the [[Honored Matres]] attacked on their return from the Scattering to the Old Empire. 7,622,014 Reverend Mothers were posted at Lampadas at the time of the Honored Matre attack and despite the efforts of the Bashar [[Burzmali]] only one Reverend Mother - [[Lucilla]] - managed to escape the planet alive, though she did carry the Shared memories of all her deceased Sisterhood on Lampadas.

Muad'Dib's forces ultimately routed the Saudakar and the Emperor negotiated with [[Paul Atreides]]. During the negotiations, [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]], now the new Baron of [[House Harkonnen]], challenged Muad'Dib to a [[kanly]] duel. Muad'Dib killed him and after his death, sealed an agreement that gave him control of the [[known universe]].

'''Planting areas''' were designated zones on the dunes of [[Arrakis]] where the planting of trees, shrubs and herbs took place. It was part of [[Pardot Kynes]]'s vision to transform Arrakis from a desert planet into a lush and fertile world.

Work on the planted areas was carried out by the [[Fremen]]. These areas were also kept free of spy satellites by bribes to the [[Spacing Guild]].

Prana-bindu
{{Original}}

[[File:51G1oU4JIaL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Prana Bindu illustration from the Dune CCG]]

'''Prana-bindu''' training denotes supreme control of nerve and muscles. 

Prana-bindu training was a cornerstone of the [[Bene Gesserit]], and all adepts, from [[acolyte|acolytes]] to [[Sister|Sisters]], to [[Reverend Mother|Reverend Mothers]], were trained in this way.

[[Paul Atreides]] was also trained in this manner, and it is likely that prana-bindu training is the basis of the [[Weirding Way]].

==Trivia==
'Prana' is a Sanskrit word for energy. 'Bindu' is a Sanskrit word for points. Together they form a reference to the discipline of mastery over the body through its energy points. This is something that the Bene Gesserit deeply study to enhance the physically adept skills over their bodies especially relevant for their controlled breeding program.

Spice hoard
{{Original}}

[[File:51ghU6my5ZL-1.jpg|thumb|Spice Hoard as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

A '''Spice hoard''' refers to a stockpile of [[spice]]. Generally, it refers to [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]]'s legendary spice hoard, though other organizations kept stockpiles of their own.

==Known Hoards==

===House Harkonnen===

[[House Harkonnen]] maintained a large spice hoard on their home planet of [[Giedi Prime]]. It was destroyed by a [[House Atreides]] special operation shortly after they gained control of [[Arrakis]].

===House Corrino===
It is extremely likely that [[House Corrino]] maintained a large spice hoard. The hoard on [[Kaitain/DE]] was discovered.

===Spacing Guild===

Being wholly dependent upon the spice for interstellar travel, the Spacing Guild likely maintained a large spice hoard.

===Bene Gesserit===

Being dependent upon the spice for the creation of [[Reverend Mother]]s, the Bene Gesserit maintained their own spice hoard. Shortly after [[Leto II]]'s death, it dwindled away to almost nothing before the sandworms and spice reappeared on [[Rakis]].

===Leto Atreides II===

A hoard of the [[spice melange]] was secreted away by the [[God-Emperor]], [[Leto Atreides II]], before his death.

During Leto's reign, melange was strictly controlled. As a result, the hoard's value as currency was said to be incalculable. Only the God-Emperor knew where the hoard was kept. Not even the emperor's last majordomo, [[Moneo Atreides]], knew its location. Over the 1500 years after Leto's reign ended, the legend of the "great spice hoard" passed into myth.

The hoard was eventually discovered by a [[Fremen]] girl and a [[Bene Gesserit]]. [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana&nbsp;Brugh]] and [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]] discovered to hoard hidden in the [[Shield Wall]], after being led there by a [[sandworm]] that was said to contain a pearl of Leto's consciousness.

With the hoard, Odrade discovered several messages inscribed by Leto on the walls in [[Chakobsa]], messages he intended for a [[Bene Gesserit]] to find. The hoard itself, while still relatively large, was not considered to be a priceless fortune by this time. After Leto's death, the [[Bene Tleilax]] had developed a way to successfully synthesise melange. Its value, though still very high, had by now dropped significantly.

The hoard of melange, fabled for its immense wealth for so long, was successfully removed from the Shield Wall by the Bene Gesserit and distributed between the Bene Gesserit, Bene Tleilax, and the [[Spacing Guild]], to be added to their respective stockpiles.

=== Great Spice Hoard ===
Legends existed of [[Great Spice Hoard|an even larger and much more ancient hoard]], predating the [[First Empire]] and the [[Spacing Guild]]. [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]]'s majordomo learned of this myth and shared it with the God-Emperor, who was disturbed by it, rather than amused as he had expected.

A '''no-ship''' was a [[starship]], and type of [[no-chamber]], that was invisible to [[prescience]]. This meant that its movements or occupants could not be seen by many of those who possessed prescient powers, such as [[Guild Navigator|Guild Navigators]], and some [[Atreides]] descendants.

==Usage==
No-ships came into heavy use during and after the time of [[The Scattering]]. They were used by people fleeing the [[Old Imperium]] into the vast unknown of uncharted space. Since no-ships possessed advanced calculation systems, they did not require a Guild Navigator's prescient abilities to avoid collision with interstellar bodies. Because of this, they could escape charted territories without difficulty. However, this also meant that they came dangerously close, if not outwardly defied, the prohibition of the use of computers.

During the time of the [[Honored Matres]], when the [[Lost Ones]] were returning to the Old Imperium, no-ships had become commonplace. Not only were they used to hide individuals and their movements, but they were also employed as planetary defenses by being placed in orbit. In this way, those who attempted to search for individuals with prescience would find it difficult, if not impossible to detect them.

At times, no-ships were often armed and took part in space battles.

The earliest known usage of a No-ship can be found in the [[Prelude to Dune]] trilogy. [[House Harkonnen]] had developed the shop using a [[Richesian]] scientist in their employ. Once the ship was finished, [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] executed the scientist to keep the No-ship secret. The No-ship was first used in [[Dune: House Atreides]] in an attempt to frame [[Duke Leto Atreides]] for an attack on a [[Bene Tleilax]] ship while inside a [[Guild]] [[Heighliner]]. The attack was a success but the plot was foiled by [[Duke Leto Atreides]]'s desperate gambit of a [[Trial by Forfeiture]]. However, the existence of the No-ship remained secret. 
Unfortunately, for [[House Harkonnen]], the [[Na-Baron]] [[Glossu Rabban Harkonnen]] took the No-Ship during a mission to the [[Bene Gesserit]] homeworld of [[Wallach IX]]. The ship was crashed and confiscated by the Bene Gesserits. Rabban was sent to [[Lankveil]] as punishment. The Bene Gesserit destroyed the No-Ship when they could not unlock it's secrets.

== Prescience-Blocking Abilities ==
Like a no-chamber, anything inside a no-ship was hidden from [[prescience|prescient]] vision and other methods of detection, although when in standby mode, it was visible with the naked eye. A no-ship had much greater technological capability than a no-chamber; for example, it was able to perform the functions of a [[Guild Navigator]]. Specifically, a no-ship's computer was capable of enough limited prescience that it could successfully navigate its way through a fold in the fabric of the space-time continuum.

Evidence suggested that certain individuals with [[House Atreides|Atreides]] ancestry were capable of using their prescient powers to "see" no-ships. [[Miles Teg]], a [[Bashar]] during the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]], and a descendant of [[Ghanima Atreides]] and [[Farad'n Corrino]], was cloned by the [[Bene Gesserit]], and his clone imprinted with the ability to nullify no-field invisibility after being exposed to a device called a T-Probe, an offshoot of an [[Ixian]] device.

== Vessel Size ==
No-ships were also gigantic. Individuals were capable of living within one for years without suffering many of the undue effects one would associate with such confinement, implying a very large and luxurious living space. More strikingly, a no-ship was capable of transporting an adult [[sandworm]], with enough sand for it to survive for the duration of the prolonged trip.

== Technological Ramifications ==
No-ships represented the fading of both the [[Butlerian Jihad|restrictions on thinking machines]] and the power of the [[Spacing Guild]], whose navigators were previously the only beings capable of interstellar navigation in their [[heighliner]] spacecraft.

Sareer

[[File:GDMPRRFDNZ1982-3.jpg|thumb]]


The '''Sareer''' was the last desert on [[Arrakis]] during the time of [[Leto Atreides II]]. It served as the site for Leto's fortress [[Citadel]].

The '''Sareer''' is flanked by the [[Forbidden Forest]], home of the ferocious [[D-wolves]], the guardians of the Sareer. Beyond that lies the '''Idaho River''', across which a bridge spans that leads to the festival city of Onn (once Arrakeen). '''Mount Idaho''' had been completely demolished to provide the raw materials to build the high walls surrounding the Sareer.<ref>Herbert, Frank. ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''. "It amuses me that a river now bears the Idaho name where once it was a mountain. That mountain no longer exists. We brought it down to get material for the high walls which girdle my Sareer."</ref> The physical dimensions of the Sareer are 1500 by 500 kilometers, with a total area of 750,000 square kilometers. This makes it somewhat larger than its closest real-life equivalent, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub_al_Khali Rub' al Khali] (Empty Quarter) desert in the Arabian Peninsula.

The Citadel itself is taken apart in the [[Famine Times]] after the death of Leto II in search of his alleged hoard of spice.

God-Emperor
{{Original}}

[[File:Hwi_&_Leto_II.gif|thumb]]

'''God-Emperor''' is the title associated with [[Leto Atreides II]] after he ascended to the throne of the [[Atreides Empire]]. The title reflects both his status as ruler of multiple galaxies, and the formidable [[prescience]] he acquired after his transformation into a [[human]]-[[sandworm]] hybrid.

The title did not endure well after his death. During his life [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II's]] enemies referred to him as [[The Tyrant]], and it was by this title that history better remembered him.

This title is incorporated into the name of the novel [[God Emperor of Dune]] without the hyphen.

=== Behind the Scenes ===
In India, God Emperor or "Chakravartin" is a title of a mystical figure which is said to cross the boundaries of several castes, and is therefore able to change the course of history/time. (Chakravartin means "he who turns the wheel of destiny".)

In Egyptian antiquity the pharaohs were seen as incarnations of the god Horus (although some speculate that the pharaohs were believed to be gods on earth, descended from Horus). Due to this they are sometimes referred to as ‘god-kings.’   

At the end of Children of Dune,  Leto II says “I’m a community dominated by one who was ancient and surprisingly powerful. His name was Harum and until his line trailed out in the congenital weakness and superstitions of a descendant, his subjects lived in a rhythmic stability. They moved unconsciously with the changes in the seasons. They bred individuals who tended to be short-lived, superstitious and easily led by a god-king. Taken as a whole, they were a powerful people. Their survival as a species became a habit.” This, some of the memories offered to Leto by Harum, and certain phrases used (“pharoahnic model” and “golden path”) heavily imply that Harum was the first pharaoh and that Leto based the title off of Egyptian god-kingdom customs. It also raises the chilling possibility that rather than Leto being advised by a committee headed by Harum, it is likely that the committee itself is in charge, with Leto as a ''member'' and Harum as the ''dominant'' personality in the god-emperor.

==Appearance==

The D-wolves have grey bodies and are "almost man-height at the shoulders". They are conditioned to stop pursuing intruders at the water edge of the [[Idaho River]]. Siona notes that the wolves are known for their keen eyesight, "[[Gaze Hounds]] in the ancestry of Leto's forest guardians". They are allowed to eat anything they hunted in the Forbidden Forest.

}}The [[Bene Gesserit]] also made extensive use of the Gom Jabbar, especially when they tested the humanity of certain individuals. In such circumstances, the device was placed against the subject's neck and acted as a deterrent for them backing out of the test. Such a method was used by [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] against [[Paul Atreides]] before his arrival on [[Arrakis]].

The gom jabbar test would be to determine whether an individual's awareness was stronger than their instincts. If their awareness of the gom jabbar's presence was strong enough, it would override their instincts to withdraw from the test, which usually involved great physical pain.

Faufreluches
{{Original}}
[[File:51NP8y474fL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Different Classes of the Faufreluches as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

'''Faufreluches''' was a term commonly used to describe the class system employed during the days of the [[Corrino Empire|Corrino Empire,]]<nowiki/>and the [[Atreides Empire]] until during the reign of the God Emperor Leto Atreides II.

The faufreluche system was meant to provide some sort of order for the way in which humanity related with one another, both to maintain order and civility, and to keep certain groups under control within the Imperium. However, it attempted to minimise alienation of individuals or minorities by providing for everyone: The motto of the faufreluche system was "A place for every man and every man in his place."

An integral part of the Faufreluche system were the [[House|Great Houses]], [[House|Minor Houses]], [[fief|siridar fiefs]], and the [[Padishah Emperor]]. The theory behind the Faufreluche system's existence was that, because of the vastness of the universe, and the immense distances across which humanity was scattered, a central figure—the Emperor—was required to provide focus and direction in people's lives. This figure was represented locally for people by the head of the Great House that governed them. <ref>''[[Dune Messiah]]''</ref>

Flaws in the Faufreluche system could be seen in that [[House Harkonnen]], once banished for cowardice after the [[Battle of Corrin]], could return and become a viable political power through market manipulation. Moreover, the [[Prescience|prescient]] powers of [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]], and [[Leto Atreides II]] revealed that the scattering of humanity without central leadership was precisely what was required in order to save it from stagnation, and, eventually, annihilation; if the entirety of humanity was concentrated sufficiently to be ruled by a single interest, it was likewise vulnerable to destruction by a single threat. Thus, upon Leto II's death, the Faufreluche system effectively ended, and humanity exploded across the universe in an immense [[The Scattering|Scattering]] during the [[The Golden Path]], ensuring humanity's future would be secure.

== Behind the scenes ==
Despite the re-emergence of Great Houses after the Scattering in [[Heretics of Dune (novel)|''Heretics of Dune'']], it does not appear that the Faufreluche system was re-established. These re-emerging Great Houses appeared to be simply one faction of a fragmented society, with many powerbrokers, with none seemingly more powerful than another.

While much of ''Dune'' was based on Arabic concepts, the Faufreluches system is clearly based on feudal European concepts, especially that of the mid-period [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire#Imperial_estates Holy Roman Empire], an elective monarchy. This kingdom was ruled by an Emperor, typically heir of the most powerful state within the Empire, which was mostly the Hohenstaufens or Habsburgs during this period. The Emperor was not automatically the father of the next Emperor and could be replaced, much like the Habsburgs replaced the previous dynasties and the Atreides replaced the Corrinos. 

Below the Emperor were very powerful princes and dukes who basically ran ''de facto'' independent autonomous states. They each had their own dynasties, much like the Great Houses of ''Dune''. The most powerful states were the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bull_of_1356 Electoral States], whose power relative to the Emperor was very much like that of the Atreides and Harkonnens against the Padishah Emperor. Alongside them but not subject to the rule of the great states, were minor ones, though often reliant on their protection, aka the Minor Houses and siridar fiefs.

A feudal subject's allegiance was to his lord, not directly to the Emperor. Many wars would be fought against the Emperor who may have been very powerful in his own right but could not fight the entire Empire, just like the Landsraad could oppose the Emperor if united. The Imperial Diet is quite clearly the inspiration of the Landsraad. The Landfrieden of the Holy Roman Empire (limiting the right of violence and feuding) is an example of another analogue with it being translated into ''Dune'' as [[Kanly]] and [[War of Assassins]]. 

Alongside the Emperor, major states and minor ones, there existed powerful power structures, chief of them the Church (a weak analogue of the [[Bene Gesserit]]) and powerful guilds running independent systems and cities (an analogue to the [[Spacing Guild]]).

The Emperor did not have an elite army analogue to the Sardaukar, though he would have the theoretical ability to call the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire Army of the Holy Roman Empire] from his feudal subjects. The Sardaukar seem to be heavily based on the Janissaries or Mamluks of the ancient Ottoman Empire.

The Holy Roman Emperor spent much of his time and effort keeping a delicate balance of power between the Electoral States, who were also very careful not to be subdued by the Emperor, leading to divisions and fragmentation which would doom the Empire in the future. The Holy Roman Empire was eventually destroyed by Napoleon, who while being of low noble birth, was a charismatic military genius and adventurer who crowned himself Emperor, while having a beloved consort in Josephine but having to eventually marry the daughter of the Austrian Emperor (the last Holy Roman Emperor, who had abdicated his position after zealous French revolutionary armies swept the old Empire), another analogue in Dune.

Chaumurky
{{Original}}

[[File:Chaumurky (Dune board game 1979 Avalon Hill).png|thumb|Chaumurky -Dune board game illustration]]

'''Chaumurky''', also called '''Murky''' and '''Musky''', was the generic term for poison placed in drink. This, along with [[chaumas]], was a common tool of trade for [[assassin]]s during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. As a result, [[poison snoopers]] were often deployed by those who could afford them, in order to detect chaumas or chaumurky prior to the consumption of food or drink.

It was known that [[House Corrino|Corrino]] Emperor [[Elrood IX]] succumbed to chaumurky, which led to his son [[Shaddam IV]] ascending to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] in 10,156AG.

Other titles for House leaders included [[Baron]], [[Archduke]], and [[Count]]. Senior women in Households were often given the title of [[Lady]].

The '''Residual Poison''' was an innovation attributed to the [[Mentat]] [[Piter de Vries]]. It was a water-borne substance that could be introduced into a victim, whereby the victim must receive the antidote repeatedly. Withdrawal of the antidote at any time would bring death after several days.

The [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] had the poison administered secretly to [[Thufir Hawat]] and provided the antidote in his food. The Harkonnens remained suspicious of Hawat's loyalties and debated withdrawing the antidote.

In the 1984 ''Dune'' film Hawat did not receive the antidote in food, but had to extract it each day from a biologically engineered cat. The poison thus served not only to control him but to degrade him as well.

Poisoned tooth

A '''Poisoned tooth''' was a weapon of assassination during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. It consisted of a false tooth with a cavity and false cap. The cavity was filled with poison gas. It was designed so that, when the bearer bit down hard on the cap and breathed out hard, the cap would break and the poison gas would be expelled into the immediate area.

It was designed to be virtually undetecable, short of close scrutiny.

[[Wellington Yueh|Dr. Wellington Yueh]] planted such a tooth into the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] as a means for killing the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] after Yueh had delivered the Duke to the Baron through betrayal.

Hwi Noree
{{Original}}
[[File:Ed87cc3384d891e3cf503a71aced1eb2-1-1.jpg|thumb]]

'''Hwi Noree''' (13702-13728 AG) was the fiancée of [[Leto Atreides II]], and the last [[Ixian]] Ambassador to [[Arrakis]] before Leto's death.

== Early Life ==
Mystery surrounded Hwi's early life. It was known that she was heavily genetically modified or sequenced by the Ixians using technology they acquired from the [[Bene Tleilax]]. She was bred to heavily impact upon the [[God-Emperor|God-Emperor's]] emotions and disrupt his [[Golden Path]], which for 3500 years had a negative impact on many rival groups and cultures in the Empire.

Hwi's life prior to her arrival on Arrakis was spent in a [[no-chamber]], where she was educated and conditioned by Ixian experts. It was there that her empathic and morally driven personality was developed. She was thus a stark contrast to her ambassadorial predecessor and uncle, [[Malky]].

== Relationship with Leto II ==
Shortly after Hwi's arrival on [[Arrakis]], she met with the [[God-Emperor]]. As the Ixians had planned, he was immediately attracted to her, finding both her physical beauty and charming personality almost intoxicating. Hwi was specifically bred to appeal to the remnants of Leto's humanity. By tempting Leto in this way, the Ixians (and those allied with them) hoped that Leto would be tempted off his Golden Path, or, at the very least, second-guess it. They were correct - using Hwi in this way worked perfectly.

Leto suspected Hwi had been planted by the Ixians. But he knew she consciously meant him no harm and also found her irresistible, a combination that prevented him from dismissing or killing her. In contrast to this realization, Leto proposed to Noree, assuring her he was incapable of physical intimacy and promising her tacit approval of a lover if they were married. After thinking about his offer, Hwi accepted.

== Death ==
After months of planning and an increase in the amount of espionage and rebellious activity by his enemies against the God-Emperor, Leto hurried along his marriage plans.

As the pair passed over a bridge far above the raging [[Idaho River]] on their way to the wedding ceremony, Idaho, [[Siona Atreides|Siona]], the unsuspecting [[Nayla]], and other rebels, orchestrated an attack which caused the bridge to collapse. Realising her fate, Hwi Noree said to Leto, ''"I'll go on ahead, Love"'' before falling to her death. She was followed quickly by Leto, who dissolved into thousands of [[sandtrout]] upon hitting the water.

== Wider Impact ==
Noree played an increasing role in the events that foreshadowed Leto's death. The most obvious example of this came from her attraction to both Leto and the last [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Idaho ghola]]. This created a rivalry that widened the wedge between Leto and Duncan, and spurred Duncan to plot his assassination attempt on Leto.

However, it remains unclear whether Hwi Noree was more beneficial to Leto's opponents or to Leto himself. Her arrival helped to hasten Leto's death, the primary goal of the Ixians. But her impact on Leto highlighted his humanity, emboldened him to take the final step (death) to guarantee his [[Golden Path]], and enabled [[human]]ity to move forward without his direction. And this, combined with his death, ultimately delivered the [[Known Universe]] down a critical part of his [[Golden Path]].

The character of Hwi Noree was one of the first Ixian characters to appear in the [[Frank Herbert]] canon. Prior to this, the Ixians were mentioned as a group, but did not appear in the ''dramatis personae'' of any ''Dune'' novel written before ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''.

In ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', the priest [[Tuek]] accounts that Hwi was secretly a [[Reverend Mother]].

She likes yogurt, When Leto II asks her if she is friends with Moneo, she says they are "friends of the stomach" in the fact that they both like yogurt.

[[File:Paul Muad'Dib Calling His First Sandworm (by John Schoenherr).jpg|''Paul Muad'Dib Calling His First Sandworm'', Paul Atreides with maker hooks (illustration by [[John Schoenherr]], ''The Illustrated Dune'')|thumb]]

'''Maker hooks''' are [[Fremen]] tools used to ride the gigantic [[Sandworms]] across large distances in the desert. They are long, narrow shafts that can be used to open a scale on a Sandworm's armor and cause sand to spill into the soft innards, causing the worm to roll over, protecting the opened scale, thus allowing Fremen to mount and ride the Sandworm.

'''Amtal rule''' is a tenet on primitive worlds under which something is tested to determine its limits or defects. Commonly: testing to destruction.

The rule is summarized as:

Conscript

A '''Conscript''' referred to a soldier in an army. 

During the time of the [[Faufreluches]], the [[House|Great Houses]] of the [[Landsraad]] relied on conscripts as part of their standing armies.

It was said that any one Imperial [[Sardaukar]] soldier was a match for 10 Landsraad military conscripts<ref>Notice the emphasis on the words "Landsraad military conscript". Perhaps the ''Landsraad'' had to submit drafts of soldiers when required by the Emperor as part of their duties. It would explain why Shaddam IV needed to cajole the Landsraad to accompany him to Arrakis instead of commanding a centralized Imperial force obedient only to him. It might also mean that the Emperor could compel the Landsraad to donate other forms of conscripts, like laborers, artisans, technicians, etc.</ref>.

==Behind the Scenes==
The source of some of this information is the Index of [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] original [[Dune (novel)]], under the "Saudaukar" entry. The rest is inferred from information available throughout the original ''Dune'' novels regarding the armies of [[House Atreides]] and [[House Harkonnen]].

The term Conscript is from the Latin ''Conscriptus'', meaning "He who has enrolled or been listed".

Spice harvester
{{Original}}

[[File:Analog+Jan+1964+Dune+John+Schoenherr+2.jpg|thumb]]

A '''spice harvester''' (also called a “crawler”) was a large, heavy, mobile factory designed to harvest [[Spice Melange|melange]]. It was dropped by carrier ships (known as [[carryall]]s) onto spice fields. These machines would then harvest and process the spice off the top of the desert floor.

This immense farming mechanism was used solely on [[Arrakis]], as it was the only known source of [[spice]] before the [[Tleilaxu]] developed a substitute.

Because of the rhythmic sound they made, they were regularly attacked by [[sandworms]]. Accompanying the crawler were two to three [[ornithopter]]s (called [[spotters]]) that hovered in the sky above, watching for [[wormsign]] (an obvious sign that a sandworm was approaching). Upon detecting wormsign, the harvester would be picked up immediately to clear it out of the way. Sandworms could be large enough to swallow a harvester.

When Paul Atreides asked [[Liet Kynes|Liet-Kynes]] if they would see a sandworm while viewing the spice harvesting, Kynes replied that they always came when they hear a spice harvester.

A good example of this process was seen when  [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]]  travelelled into the desert to inspect a harvesting operation and its equipment.

Awareness spectrum narcotic
{{Original}}

[[File:Original-water-of-life-1.jpg|thumb]]


An '''awareness spectrum narcotic''' is any narcotic substance that has the ability to expand an individual's consciousness on some level. This expansion of consciousness could manifest itself in many ways, including [[prescience]], [[Other Memory]], or simply an increase in immediate awareness and sensory ability.

Those who possessed the ability to see into the future when taking awareness spectrum narcotics were considered [[prescience|prescient]]. [[Spacing Guild]] [[Guild Navigator|Navigators]] were capable of such abilities, as were some members of the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] genetic line.

Many awareness spectrum narcotics were known to exist throughout the [[Imperium]]. The [[spice melange]], which originated on the planet [[Arrakis]], was perhaps the most powerful, and certainly the most widely known throughout the [[known universe]], both during the days of the [[Imperium]] and beyond.

Other use of awareness spectrum narcotics included the detection of deliberate falsehood via the introduction of [[truthtrance]]. This subgroup of awareness spectrum narcotics, however, were often fatal to the user unless they possessed the ability to change the substance within their own bodies. 

==Behind the Scenes==
*[[Frank Herbert]], in the appendices of [[Dune (novel)|Dune]], often referred to the spice melange as one of many awareness spectrum narcotics.

Creosote bush

[[File:Dune (Cryo game) terraforming effort on map.png|thumb]]

A '''Creosote bush''' is a form of shrub native to [[Arrakis]]. It required very little water, and was capable of digging deep into sand dunes to find it. It has Shallow roots to catch rain, it also has bad odour to repel animals and poison at the bottom of the trunk.

The bush also has shiny leaves to catch and hold water.

When the [[Fremen]] of Arrakis needed to perform delicate work with their hands, they would often remove the gloves from their [[stillsuit]]s and rub their hands with leaves from the creosote bush. This would help prevent perspiration through the hands.

The planting of creosote bushes formed part of the terraforming of Arrakis that was begun by Imperial [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]].

== Behind the Scenes ==
Typically, a Baron would rank the lowest in most known peerage systems. In the case of House Harkonnen, this would make sense, as their limited history in the original [[Dune (novel)|Dune]] novel provided by [[Frank Herbert]] indicates that the Harkonnens were banished for cowardice after the [[Battle of Corrin]], and that they plied back Great House status through adroit manipulation of the [[whale fur]] trade. Therefore, the Harkonnen barony was appears to have been granted due to their sheer amassment of wealth.

Idaho River
{{Original}}

The '''Idaho River''' was a major river on [[Arrakis]] during the reign of [[Leto Atreides II]].

It was the product of a long-term terraforming project that was begun by [[Pardot Kynes]], Leto's maternal great grandfather. Kynes' vision was to transform Arrakis from a desert world into a lush paradise with open water and green forests. However, the river only became a significant natural landmark during Leto II's reign. It was named after [[Duncan Idaho]], the loyal [[House Atreides|Atreides]] swordmaster.

Leto was killed when his [[Royal Cart]] plunged into the Idaho River after the bridge that crossed it was detonated by assassins.

The river ceased to exist some years later, when the [[sandtrout]] that had left Leto's worm body after his death, began the process of once again making Arrakis a desert world.

Fief
{{Original}}


[[File:Dune-ccg-judge-of-the-change-quasi-fief-139s_51x5sKZ-T5L-1.jpg|thumb|Quasi-fief -Dune CCG Illustration]]

A '''fief''' was a territorial obligation handed down by [[Padishah Emperor]]s to [[House]]s during the time of the [[Faufreluches]].

== Siridar fief ==
Typically, a ''[[siridar]]'', or planetary fief meant that the ruling clan, or [[House|Great House]], ruled over the entire planet, and was charged with the upholding of Imperial law, as well as the social order imposed by the Faufreluches system. The planetary governor would typically be referred to by adding the word "siridar" in front of his existing title of nobility, and would be required to submit a tithe to the Emperor after collecting profit and taxes from the populace of those living within the fief.

A siridar fief could last for thousands of years. However, it could be withdrawn by the Padishah Emperor at his discretion, or he could order a Great House to abandon one fief and take another.

It seems very clear that the [[Galach]] ''siridar,'' [[Fremen]] ''al-asiridar'' derives from the original Arabic ''as-sadar''," i. e. "voice" [of the Emperor], this usage presumably referring to the fact that the designated official speaks in the Emperor's name to stipulate what will happen.

== Behind the Scenes ==
After the death of [[Leto Atreides II]], it is not known whether planetary fiefs continued to exist, especially since there was no emperor to give them. Indeed, it is not known whether Leto II himself allowed the fiefs of the Great Houses to be maintained.

Moreover, it is also not known whether the Great Houses that were re-emerging during the time the [[Lost Ones]] were returning from [[The Scattering]] were also holders of planetary fiefs, or whether their Great House status was acknowledged because their power developed through other means, such as market manipulation and entrepreneurial activities.

Esmar Tuek
{{Original}}

'''Esmar Tuek''' was a [[Spice melange|spice]] [[smuggler]] in the days of [[Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]].

Tuek's operation was based in the polar regions of [[Arrakis]]. For many years he was responsible for smuggling spice off Arrakis for profit. A cunning and astute businessman, Tuek had secret arrangements with the [[Fremen]], both as a means of making profit and as a way of undermining the rule of the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]].

When the Harkonnens were replaced by the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] on the order of the Emperor, Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] convinced Tuek and his band of smugglers that House Atreides would ignore their operations if they gave a percentage of their profits to the Duke.

He was invited to a formal dinner hosted by the Duke, at the suggestion of the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] in an effort to sow doubt among the Duke Leto's enemies on [[Arrakis]]. During the dinner, the Duke is called away when Harkonnen spies tried to sell the stolen Atreides [[carryall]] to the smugglers. Tuek's men, under orders from Tuek, handed the spies and the carryall to Atreides authorities, earning Tuek the Duke's gratitude. Upon leaving the dinner, the Duke left Paul as host; he was challenged then by a guild Banker in Harkonnen employ, and Tuek, together with Kynes/Liet, interfere in the resulting verbal battle, which ended with the Banker duly embarrassed.

When House Atreides was attacked and the Duke killed, Tuek was killed, and [[Gurney Halleck]], Atreides [[Warmaster]], along with a handful of House Atreides forces, managed to escape and fall in with Tuek's son [[Staban]] and his men, where they remained for two years.

Tuek's descendants seemed to have remained on Arrakis. A distant yet direct descendant, [[Hedley Tuek]] was High Priest of the [[Rakian Priesthood]] some 5000 years after the time of Esmar Tuek.

Weirding Way
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-02-12-40-57-1.png|thumb|Weirding Way -Dune RPG illustration]]

The '''Weirding Way''' was a form of movement heavily influenced by [[Prana-bindu]] physical and psychological training. It was initially developed and used by the [[Bene Gesserit]], but later became an important element of [[Fremen]] hand-to-hand combat during [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]].

==Benefits==
During close-quarters combat, an individual adept at the Weirding Way was able to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. To the opponent (and any bystanders) the movement seemed almost like close-quarter teleportation.

==Underlying concepts==
The teleportation-like effect was accomplished by altering one's perception of reality, and thus mastery of the Weirding Way required a dramatic shift in one's concepts of both space-time, and cause and effect.

The key axiom of the Weirding Way was, in the words of [[Farad'n Corrino]], ''"my mind affects my reality."'' 

==Limitations==
Possibly due to inherent limitations within the [[human]] psyche or physical body, the Weirding Way was usually only effective at short distances, usually up to a few meters.

'Prana' in Sanskrit refers to the flow of energy through the system of 'nadis' or channels in the human body. It also means something like 'breath'. Breath-control is a technique used in some kinds of tantric meditation.

Some peoples during the days of the [[Faufreluches]] maintained their own battle language, including some [[House|Great Houses]] such as [[House Atreides]], [[House Harkonnen]], and the [[Bene Gesserit]].

The idea behind a battle language was that communications could not be intercepted by enemies, and that it could be easily recognised and not mistaken for anything else in the fog of war. It usually consisted of hand signals, or, in the case of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient language long since forgotten by any living peoples. This language would often be drawn from [[Other Memory]].

Famine Times
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

The '''Famine Times''' were a period of time immediately after the death of [[Leto Atreides II]], just before [[The Scattering]].

The Famine Times were a result of [[Leto's Peace]], whereby all populations were planet bound. Following Leto's death, the peoples of the [[Imperium]] fell into famine, since they had come to rely on Leto's Empire for all things.

These times were characterised by the cannibalism of machinery and the plundering of natural resources. An example of this was the partial deforestation of the planet [[Gammu]] of its [[Pilingitam]] trees.

The desperation felt by those experiencing the Famine Times eventually led to the explosion of humanity across the universe. This was the essence of [[Scattering|The Scattering]], and part of the [[Golden Path]] that would save humanity from stagnation and annihilation.

The '''Divided God''' is one of the names given to [[Leto Atreides II]] by the [[Rakian Priesthood]].

The term was used to describe both the Rakian [[sandworms]] and Leto himself. Upon his death, Leto's worm body disintegrated, thereby releasing hundreds of [[sandtrout]] into the desert, which would eventually lead to the re-emergence of sandworms on [[Arrakis|Rakis]]. Moreover, Leto had foreseen that upon his death, the worms that grew from the sandtrout would maintain a pearl of his consciousness, and that he would live on in an "endless dream" within the worms. Thus, the term "Divided God" would refer to the division of Leto through the sandworms.

A '''concubine''' is any consort to a ruling member of a [[House|Great House]].

Concubines were often taken by ruling members of Great Houses for companionship. This was considered an ideal practice when one wished for other Great Houses to think they were available for alliance through marriage.

Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] took the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] as his concubine. Even though he loved her, he believed that he could one day elevate himself and his House through a political marriage.

Leto's son, [[Paul Atreides]], also took his love [[Chani Kynes|Chani]] as his concubine, so that he could marry Princess [[Irulan Corrino]], legitimise his rule, and ascend to the [[Golden Lion Throne]].

Over the next few decades, [[Leto Atreides II]] inherited the throne with his sister-wife, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] at his side after the death of their parents. Irulan's nephew, [[Prince]] [[Farad'n Corrino]] became Ghanima's concubine.

Tertius Eileen Anteac
{{original|DE}}

[[File:Tumblr_n8uqclUGRg1qep85ko1_400.jpg|thumb]]

'''Tertius Eileen Anteac''', born as '''Tersius Helen Anteac''', was a [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Mentat]] [[Reverend Mother]] and [[Truthsayer]] during the last years of the reign of the [[God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]]. According to the God Emperor's knowledge, Anteac was a descendant of the famous Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]]. She had a scar in her forehead, and served faithfully the plans of the God Emperor concerning the [[Ixian]]s.

In her youth, she trained on [[Wallach IX]] in a supposedly hidden Mentat school. When Duncan Idaho was sent by the God Emperor to supress the school, she briefly talked with Idaho.

She went to [[Arrakis]] in [[13728 AG]] together with the Reverend Mother and also Truthsayer [[Marcus Claire Luyseyal]] for an audience with the God Emperor which coincided with the [[Onn|Royal Festival held every ten years]]. She and Luyseyal received the message the assistant to the Ixian Ambassador, [[Othwi Yake]], that [[Face Dancers]] had infiltrated in the Ixian Embassy and were planning to assassinate Leto II. The message did not reached Leto's hands in time, but anyway it failed, as both Anteac and [[Luyseyal]] knew it would. They achieved little in their meeting with the God Emperor, and he took the priceless [[spice]] with which they expected to test his mortality.

Later, Leto enlisted Anteac's aid in detecting the [[Tleilaxu]] [[Face Dancers]] who had replaced almost everyone in the Ixian embassy, except the new ambassador, [[Hwi Noree]]. During her mission, Anteac identified the duplicate of Othwi Yake, since the original had sent her the message of the Assassination Attempt against the God Emperor. Then, [[Moneo Atreides]], Leto's Majordomo, recognized that Anteac was a secret [[Mentat]], a skill prohibited in the Empire, but Leto afirmed that he knew that already and that that amused him.

Hwi Noree, the new Ixian Ambassador, shared her knowledge of the environment in which she was brought up with Anteac, who had been conscripted by Leto to lead a [[Fish Speaker]] assault on [[Ix]], in order to wrest the secret of Hwi's origins. When the notice of Leto and Hwi's marriage was going to take place, Anteac was shocked, and at the same time, annoyed that her order had allowed such a talented woman as Hwi to pass through their training without turning her into one of them, a true [[Bene Gesserit Training|Bene Gesserit sister]].

Anteac lead the Fish Speaker invasion of Ix, where they captured [[Malky]], the former Ixian Ambassador. However, the faithful Anteac died during the mission. 1,500 years later, [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho]] affirmed that [[Bellonda]], advisor of [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]] and also a [[Mentat]], was indeed a descendant of Anteac.

Pilingitam
{{Original}}
'''Pilingitam''' is a native tree of planet [[Giedi Prime]].

The wood from the trees was highly prized by artists and artisans throughout the known universe. When it was freshly cut, it was as pliable as any softwood. However, after it was allowed to age and dry, it became a hardwood. Further, it was capable of absorbing many pigments, and it could be made to look like the pigmentation occurred naturally within the wood's grain.

Pilingitam wood was also known to be anti-fungal, impervious to insect consumption, and fire resistant.

The leaves of pilingitam trees had a distinctive lime-green colour.

During the [[Famine Times]], many pilingitam trees were logged but many were also maintained, and some replanted on the orders of the [[Bene Gesserit]], who controlled much of Giedi Prime (now Gammu) when the [[Lost Ones]] were returning from [[The Scattering]].

Older pilingitam trees grew to be extremely large. Truly ancient examples were known to spread its leaves over three hectares.

[[Miles Teg]] used pilingitam trees as secret markers for the Bashar [[Burzmali]] to find when Teg was running from [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] forces seeking to capture him and the [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola in his charge.

Paul would not sign, but did agree with the Guild not revealing its location, since it was the "sanctuary planet" for Great Houses that were defeated in a [[War of Assassins]].

In 10208 AG, Paul finally agreed to sign, but only if the Guild were to make the [[The Ixian Confederacy|Ixian Confederacy]] submit to his Imperial tax. The guild then stopped all trade of Ix, the Confederacy submitted, and the treaty was signed.

Poison snooper
{{Original}}

'''Poison snoopers''' are mechanical devices that were designed to detect poison in food ([[chaumas]]) or drink ([[chaumurky]]). Typically, there were two types of snooper: ''fixed'' and ''portable''.

''Fixed'' poison snoopers were usually fixed to the ceiling of rooms where people took their meals. They remained active and would emit an alarm if poison was detected.

''Portable'' snoopers were usually small hand-held boxes with a hose extension. The hose had a sensor on the end, and would be passed over the food or drink by the user. Like the fixed snooper, it would emit an alarm if poison was detected.

Poison snoopers were usually of [[House Richese|Richesian]] or [[Ixian]] manufacture. However, the Ixian devices were usually preferred because they were more sensitive. However, poison snoopers were not infallible. Some forms of poison were not detected by snoopers.

Snoopers were expensive devices, and were usually employed by wealthy families during the days of the [[Faufreluches]]. However, those families usually required snoopers because they were wealthy. Indeed, such devices were quite common when [[House|Great Houses]] of the [[Old Imperium]] were feuding.

By the time of the [[Honored Matres]], poison snoopers were still in use. However, they had become smaller and less cumbersome.

[[Paul Atreides]] killed [[Jamis]] in mortal combat after Jamis invoked the [[Amtal Rule]], and issued the Tahaddi Challenge to him.

==Succession==
In [[Fremen]] society, someone wishing to become the [[Naib]] of the tribe must "call out" the current Naib; issue the Tahaddi Challenge and fight to the death.

When [[Paul Atreides]] took the mantle of [[Mahdi]], he changed this custom, refusing to call [[Stilgar]] out, as he did not want to weaken the Fremen before their battle against the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]]. He also did not want to kill his friend. He made it extremely clear to the Fremen that no one man could stand against him in single combat, and that it was foolish for the Fremen to kill their best and wisest leaders for the sake of ritual.

Otheym
{{Original}}

'''Otheym''' was a renowned [[Fremen]] fighter and devoted follower of [[Paul Atreides]]. He was a key figure in the training of Fremen fighters in the [[Weirding Way]], and in the liberation of [[Arrakis]] from [[House Harkonnen]].

Originally from [[Sietch Gara Kulon]], Otheym came to [[Sietch Tabr]] to join Muad'dib's crusade and was one of the first [[Fedaykin]]. Otheym was also the one tasked with taking the Waters of Life to a very large pre-spice mass, which if intiated, would have created a deadly chain reaction ultimately destroying all vectors of the sandworm.

Otheym later served as a senior commander in the spread of [[Muad'dib's Jihad]] across the [[Known Universe]]. He returned to Dune after contracting the [[spitting disease]] on [[Tarahell]]. A true Fremen and friend to Muad'dib until the end, Otheym provided details on those plotting against the Atreides Emperor. He had one daughter named [[Lichna]] with his wife [[Dhuri]].

Masheikh
{{Original}}

[[File:1367257553_1fc3ead065_z.jpg|thumb|Tleilax Master by knightbeer39]]

'''Masheikh''' was a secret title held by [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Tleilaxu Master|Masters]] who sat on the [[Ruling Council]].

== Duties ==
It was the duty of the ten Masheikhs to rule over the Tleilaxu empire, and plot their conquest over rival cultures and organizations, including the [[Landsraad]], the [[Spacing Guild]], and most notably the [[Bene Gesserit]].

The Masheikhs also viewed themselves as divine messengers and representatives of God.

== Continuity ==
The title of Masheikh seldom passed from one Tleilaxu Master to another, partly due to the longevity of Tleilaxu Masters, and partly because of a perceived need to maintain continuity in the Tleilaxu's long-term plans.

== Known Masheikhs ==
* [[Abdl]]
* [[Mahai]]
* [[Mirlat]]
* [[Scytale]]
* [[Torg the Younger]]
* [[Tylwyth Waff]]


==Behind the Scenes==

Most likely from the Arabic word: Mashaikh (Apparently also rendered as Masheikh, Masheik, and Mashaykh. '''''Arabic''''' '''مشايخ''' ) refers to the educated class of [[Muslim]] legal scholars engaged in the several fields of [[Islamic studies]]. They are best known as the arbiters of [[Sharia|shari‘a]] (or spelled shariat in Heretics of Dune) in the law. While the Mashaikh are well versed in legal [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] being Islamic lawyers, some of them also go on to specialize in other fields, such as [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Kalam|dialectical theology]] or [[Tafsir|Quranic hermeneutics]] or explanation. The fields studied, and the importance given them, will vary from tradition to tradition, or even from seminary to seminary. In a broader sense, the term ''Mashaikh'' is used to describe the body of Muslim clergy who have completed several years of training and study of Islamic sciences, such as a [[Mufti|mufti]], [[Qadi|qadi]], [[Faqih|faqih]], or [[Muhaddith|muhaddith]]. Some Muslims include under this term the village [[Mullah|mullahs]], [[Imam|imams]], and [[Maulvi|maulvis]]—who have attained only the lowest rungs on the ladder of Islamic scholarship; other Muslims would say that clerics must meet higher standards to be considered ulema.

Hidden Noble Rank
{{original}}

[[File:Theodor-pistek-princess-irulan---the-costume-design-for-the-dune-miniseries.jpg|thumb|Irulan Corrino - Theodor Pistek]]

'''Hidden Noble Rank''' was a term used by the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Proctor Superior]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood to indicate that an individual's true highest rank within the Sisterhood could not be publicly identified.

The best-known Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Proctor Superior of the Hidden Noble Rank was the Lady [[Anirul Corrino]], the beloved wife of the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]]. After her tragic death on the planet [[Kaitain]], she was succeeded by her eldest daughter, the first-born Imperial [[Crown Princess]] [[Irulan Corrino]].

== Behind the Scenes ==
[[Frank Herbert]] never expanded on why it was necessary for someone from the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood to have their noble rank hidden. 

It was possible that the Hidden Noble Rank was used when a person's standing within the Sisterhood was so high that it was necessary to keep it secret, especially if somebody else was still married to the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe and became the mother of his Imperial heirs apparent.

Fremen Funeral Rite
{{Original}}
[[File:Funeral.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''Fremen funeral rite''' usually involved the taking of the deceased person's water through the [[deathstill]]s, along with a short ceremony where people who knew and were fond of the deceased would come forward, speak of how they were a friend of the deceased, and take one of their personal possessions.

After [[Paul Atreides]] killed [[Jamis]] in a [[Tahaddi challenge]], Paul's guilt over killing the man caused him to shed tears during the funeral rite. According to longstanding [[Fremen]] tradition, to weep during a funeral rite was said to be "giving water to the dead". This was regarded as a profound experience, and one by which the Fremen present were awed.

Barony

'''Barony''' was the capital city of planet [[Giedi Prime]] during the rule of [[House Harkonnen]]. After the fall of the Harkonnens, the name of the city was changed to [[Ysai]].

Barony's skyline was dominated by an extremely large rectangular building in its centre, which was surrounded by mostly low-level housing. The structure was 950 stories tall and 45 kilometers long, with no access at ground level, as it was a [[slave]] colony. It was here that [[Duncan Idaho]] was enslaved with his family. Architecturally, the idea was so that the populace could "look up" to its rulers, and remember their lowly place.

Much of Barony's population was slave labour to operate Harkonnen factories and die as [[gladiator]]s and sport in the entertainment arenas, usually for the sake of the rich [[Houses]] Minor who maintained operations there.

The city was renamed [[Ysai]] after the Harkonnens left Giedi Prime and the planet was renamed [[Gammu]]. However, the skyline remained largely unchanged.

After [[The Scattering]], The [[Planetary Bank of Gammu]] maintained its headquarters at Ysai.

The '''Elacca drug''' is a narcotic that was formed by the burning of [[Elacca Wood]] of the planet [[Ecaz]]. Its main characteristic when administered was that it would eliminate the user's will for self-preservation. As a result, it was popular during the days of the [[Imperium]], when it would be administered to [[gladiator]]s to prepare them for the ring.

Typically, those who had been drugged with this substance would display a carrot-coloured pigmentation to their skin.

Leto's Peace lasted approximately 3,500 years. It meant that none of the Empire's stakeholders could go to war with one another. This was accomplished by maintaining strict control over [[space travel]], and forcing peoples to remain planet-bound. It was part of Leto's [[Golden Path]], and was a contributing factor to the [[Famine Times]] and [[the Scattering]] after Leto's death.

Leto's Peace had been developed into what it was from the [[Guild Peace]] that had been in place for more than 10,000 years prior to Leto's reign.

Stunner
{{Original}}
[[File:Stunner (Dune board game 1979 Avalon Hill).png|thumb|Stunner -Dune board game illustration]]

A '''stunner''' (sometimes named a '''slammer,''' in order to avoid confusion with sonic firearms) was a refined version of the Terran pneumatic speargun. This slow-pellet [[projectile weapon]] was widely favored for the fact that it could be used safely against [[shield]]s.

The weapon threw a [[poison]]-tipped or [[drug]]-tipped dart. A stunner's effectiveness was limited by variations in shield settings, and by relative motion between the projectile and its target.

When [[House Harkonnen]] attacked [[House Atreides]] on [[Arrakis]], the [[Sardaukar]] forces used [[Kindjal|kindjals]] and stunners so that they could kill without the risk of attracting a [[sandworm]].


{{rewrite}}


Less-common variations on this weapon included: 

''*Gauss pistols and rifles, ''which had range-settings similar to a stunner's, but which propelled their rounds magnetically rather than with compressed gas; 

''*Cone pistols and rifles ''(collectively known as ''gyrosluggers), ''which fired miniature self-propelled "jet grenades" that gradually accelerated after being launched...thus largely eliminating the need for range-settings. '' ''

Great Convention
{{Original}}

The '''Great Convention''' was a historic treaty brokered between the [[Houses|Great Houses]], the [[Spacing Guild]], and the [[Imperium]] shortly after the destruction of the [[thinking machines]]. It prohibited the use of [[atomics]] against [[human]] targets.

Every article of the Great Convention began with the term ''"The forms must be obeyed..."''.

The underlying philosophy of the Great Convention was that of human life being precious and superior to all other forms of existence. Its principal guideline is that human life was to be protected. As a result, strict rules were put in place for wars and feuds. [[Kanly]] was a principal example of this, as was the [[War of Assassins]].

After the rise of [[Paul Atreides]] to the [[Golden Lion Throne]], the influence of the Great Convention lessened. Indeed, less than twenty years into Paul's rule he was blinded when a [[stone burner]] was set off in [[Arrakeen]] on the planet [[Arrakis]]. The culprits were the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] and dissident [[Fremen]].

Spice mining
{{Original}}

[[File:51pKQwCZUQL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Spice Mining as depicted in the Dune CCG]]
'''Spice mining''' is the process by which the [[spice melange]] was removed from the sands of the planet [[Arrakis]] for consumption. 

The spice mining process was a labour-intensive, difficult and dangerous process. [[Spice harvester|Spice Harvesters]] collected the spice from the sand dunes. While the harvester would collect the spice, [[spotters]] would be on the ground and in the air, scouting for [[wormsign]]. If wormsign was detected, [[Carryall|Carryalls]] would then lift the harvester to safety before the [[sandworm]] can attack. Unfortunately, this was often, as worms would attack all rhythmic vibrations, and harvesters were heavy pieces of machinery that would generate considerable vibration.

All spice mining equipment required considerable manpower by way of [[Dunemen]] in order to be operated effectively.

Elrood IX/DE
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Elrood.png|thumb|Elrood, by Dev Pramanik and Alex Guimarães, House Atreides Graphic novel ]]

'''Elrood IX''' (d. [[10156 AG]]) was the son of [[Fredhrick XIX]] and brother of Emperor [[Corrin XXV]] and of [[Cirni Fenring]]. 

When his brother died, he succeeded him. Elrood negotiated with the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] (who offered impressive inducements) of accepting arranged marriages to Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank. 

He also rewarded [[Pardot Kynes/DE|Pardot Kynes]] by assigning him as Imperial Planetologist to [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]]. He was the father of [[Shaddam IV/DE|Prince Shaddam]] with [[Fasrille]].

Elrood was intrigued by the [[Gamont]] background of [[Anuril Corrino/DE|Anuril Corrino]], his son's concubine, and apparently insisted on tests and refresher lessons. However as her friendship with Shaddam grew, so did her hatred for Elrood. In [[10155 AG]], Shaddam took Anuril as his wife, primarily to protect her from his father's growing obsession.

Around that time spies for the Heir Apparent Prince Shaddam including [[Hasimir Fenring/DE|Hasimir Fenring]] ferreted out an assassination plot against the Prince. In the glare of publicity, Elrood exercised the only option available to him: the torture, confession, and execution of one of the more peripheral family members blamed for the plot.

The revealed plot led to the widespread adoption of the [[hunter-seeker]]. There was also a theory that responsible for the assassination was Elrood himself (which resulted in his own death to [[chaumurky]] soon later). Seven Imperial servants were executed as a result of the death.

{{original}}
The frequently discredited [[Pirate History of Corrino]] related the curious story that [[Hasimir Fenring/DE|Hasimir Fenring]] was responsible for his death. He was succeeded by his son as [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]].

Hidden Rank
{{Original}}

'''Hidden Rank''' is a term used by the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood to indicate that an individual's true rank within the Sisterhood could not be publicly identified.

Known Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank include the Lady [[Anirul Corrino]], wife of the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], and her daughter [[Irulan Corrino]], titular wife of Padishah Emperor [[Paul Atreides]].

== Behind the Scenes ==
[[Frank Herbert]] never expanded on why it was necessary for someone from the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood to have their rank hidden. It was possible that the Hidden Rank was used when a person's standing within the Sisterhood was so high that it was necessary to keep it secret, especially if one was married to the Emperor. It is possible that a custom developed for the Imperial Consort to have her rank hidden, as a [[Reverend Mother]] might be seen as a threat, or an ordinary Sister seen as a slight.

Farok
{{Original}}

[[File:Farok.png|thumb]]

'''Farok''' was a [[Fremen]] from [[Sietch Tabr]]. He was one of the [[Fedaykin]].

During [[Muad'dib's Jihad]], Farok became [[Bashar ]]of the Ninth Legion and fought on a number of worlds including [[Enfeil]], where he led his legion to victory, and [[Naraj]], where his son was blinded by a [[stone burner]].

Later, Farok was killed by [[Scytale]] shortly before he took [[Lichna]]'s identity

{{encyclopedia}}

It is mentioned that after the final victory on [[Molitor]] he and other [[Fremen/DE]] warriors celebrated in a great feast in [[Paul's Keep/DE]] and his first-hand account is quoted in the ''Encyclopedia''.<ref>Arrakeen Palace</ref>
==Behind the Scenes==
===Discrepancies===
Farok is initially described with a missing arm: "Scytale returned his gaze to the old man [Farok], noted the empty sleeve dangling from the left shoulder and the lack of a stillsuit." Only a few paragraphs later, however, Farok has mysteriously regained his arm: ""Thrice blessed," Farok said, folding his hands into his lap in the ritual clasp. They were old, heavily veined hands."

This has given rise to a running joke within the Dune fandom that Farok did in fact have ''three'' arms.
===In Other Media===
Farok was portrayed by Ivo Novák in the 2003 [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]] miniseries.

High Council
{{Original}}

[[File:MFATtIRjFp8Jlc-QogV-KaQ-1.jpg|thumb]]


The '''High Council''' is the inner circle of the [[Landsraad]] during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. It presided over disputes between [[House|Houses]].

The arbitrary decision of the [[Judge of the Change]] could only be disputed before the High Council, and only when the [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] was present. A grievance was brought before the High Council in a [[Bill of Particulars]].

Shortly after the assassination of Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto]] and the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]]/[[House Corrino|Corrino]] invasion of Arrakis, [[Paul Atreides]] had expressed a desire to put forward a [[Bill of Particulars]] to the Landsraad High Council to express his grievance and the laws that had been broken by this invasion. He believed that his grievance would be supported because the Great Houses would not support the [[Sardaukar]] eliminating them one-by-one, which was one of the principal reasons why the Landsraad existed to begin with.

Pentashield
{{Original}}

A '''pentashield''' was a five-layered shield-generated field suitable for small areas such as doorways or passenges. A large pentashield could be generated but it would become increasingly unstable with each successive layer that went up. 

They were virtually impassable to anyone not wearing a dissembler that was tuned to the same codes as the shield was tuned. A pentashield set up in such a way was also known as a Prudence Door (''Pru-Door'') or Prudence Barrier (''Pru-Barrier''), and such a configuration were used to facilitate the escape of only selected people, who were often under pursuit.

The [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Harkonnen's]] bedroom was fitted with a pentashield so that anyone who saw him would have to stand, blocked by it, until the Baron deactivated it, and then reactivated once they came in.

Truthsayer
{{Original}}
[[File:Dune-Ccg-Judge-Of-The-Change-1-Jotc-1-1.jpg|thumb|Bene Gesserit Truthsayer as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

A '''Truthsayer''' is anyone who can detect truth when it is being told, with the ability itself being referred to as '''truthsense'''. Truthsayers were often employed by [[Imperium|the Imperium]] on behalf of the [[Padishah Emperor]].

Truthsaying was a skill developed and used by the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood. Indeed, the majority of Truthsayers employed during the time of the [[Faufreluches]] were Bene Gesserit adepts. Largely because of this skillset and the Bene Gesserit's ties to it, several factions viewed it as invaluable in gaining political power and prestige, which was implied by [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen]] when asking why his uncle, Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], never bought a Bene Gesserit as a sex slave, before his uncle while snapping at him implied the reason he never bought one was because of his homosexual tastes.

The ability to see truth was also seen as a gift that some individuals were born with. [[Paul Atreides]] was identified as one such individual by the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] when she first met him on [[Caladan]] in [[10191 AG]].

Judge of the Change
{{Original}}

[[File:Dune-Ccg-Judge-Of-The-Change-1-Jotc-2-1.jpg|thumb|Imperial Judge as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

'''Judge of the Change''' was a title given to an [[Imperium|Imperial]] officer who was charged with presiding over a change of planetary [[Fief]], declarations and forms of [[kanly]], or [[War of Assassins]] during the days of the [[Imperium]].

A Judge's authority could only be challenged before the [[High Council]].

It was customary for a man's position to pass down to his son during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. When Judge of the Change [[Pardot Kynes]] passed away, the title was passed to his son, [[Liet Kynes]].

It was typically in the best interest of the new fief holder to demonstrate that the forms of the [[Great Convention]] were obeyed. As a result, both sides of a feud would generally treat the Judge with respect. [[House Harkonnen]] discarded this tradition by killing Liet Kynes when they wrested control of [[Arrakis]] from their enemies, the [[House Atreides|Atreides]]. They sent him into the deep desert and abandoned him.

Universal Standard Calendar
{{Original}}
The '''Universal Standard Calendar''', also known as the '''Imperial Calendar''', is the standard measurement of [[time]] in the [[known universe]]. It centered around the founding of the [[Spacing Guild]], which established a monopoly on all space travel, transport, and Imperial banking throughout the [[known universe]], as the starting year. ''''BG''' stands for ''Before Guild'', and '''AG''' stands for ''After Guild''. This date was chosen as an important date to begin counting years because the establishment of the Spacing Guild's monopoly meant that interstellar travel and finance became more uniform and orderly. This also meant that parties were limited in where and when they could wage war on each other. This restriction was called the [[Guild Peace]].

==Behind the Scenes==
The ''Dune'' novels use a different calendar from that of present day [[Earth]]. Years are not counted before and after the birth of Christ, but before and after the establishment of the [[Spacing Guild|Spacing Guild's]] monopoly, measured as before and after Guild.

Using the information given by the Dune books, it is possible to determine how the dating system used in the novels corresponds to our own.

1. '''[[Butlerian Jihad]]'''<br />
Butlerian Jihad lasts "two cruel generations" ''Dune, Appendix II / V''<br />
201 - 108 BG

2. '''The 200th century'''<br />
"Mankind's movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion during the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the Butlerian Jihad.” Dune, Appendix II<br />
~11,000 years

''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' begins in 10,191 AG, so we simply add 10,191 to 11,000+201 together:

10,191 + 11,000 + 201 = 21,392

This gives us the number of years that have passed in-between 10,191 AG and the beginning of deep space exploration. The first interplanetary space probe was Pioneer 5 which was launched in 1960. If we start at 1960 A.D. and add 21,392 more years, we have 23,352 A.D.

Thus, the year 10,191 AG corresponds to the year 23,352 A.D. That is, of course, assuming that the Dune chronology actually uses Earth years.

But Dune counts in Standard years:

:"[[Taraza]] was momentarily abashed. This was an imposition. [[Teg]] was still a regal figure, tall and with that large head topped by gray hair. He was, she knew, four SY short of three hundred. '''Granting that the Standard Year was some twenty hours less than the so-called primitive year''', it was still an impressive age with experiences in [[Bene Gesserit]] service that demanded that she respect him." ''HoD ~Page 36''

So there could be a maximum error of about 400 years (since we do not know when the [[Dune Universe]] started using the "Standard" year). This method also assumes that humankind began exploring "deep" space in the 20th century a decade after World War II.



In the [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 Dune film]], the real-world Anno Domini or Common Era calendar is used, though the numbers used are the same, placing the beginning of the film in 10,191 AD. The TV Prologue places the events of the Butlerian Jihad in 6,041 AD.

In the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 Dune]] and [[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]], no reference is made to any specific calendar system.

'''Count Hasimir Fenring''' ([[10133 AG]] - [[10225 AG]]) was a renowned assassin and [[Mentat]] political tactician who was one of the deadliest fighters in the [[Corrino Empire|Corrino Imperium]]. Fenring was also genetic eunuch and a failed [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. A distaff cousin of [[House Corrino]], all accounts agreed that Fenring was the closest friend [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] possessed. The Imperial chores carried out by Count Fenring included that of [[Imperial Agent]] on [[Arrakis]] during the Harkonnen regime there and later [[Siridar-Absentia]] of [[Caladan]]. He joined Shaddam IV in retirement on [[Salusa Secundus]]. 

== Biography ==
Fenring was a part of the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[breeding program]] and was one of the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] candidates, but was crippled by his being a genetic eunuch. Fenring's talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion, and rendered him invisible to prescient vision, even to the prescience of someone as powerful as [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Muad'Dib]], the first Kwisatz Haderach.

He was also a relative to [[Dalak Fenring]], who married [[Wensicia Corrino]]. After the ascent of Shaddam to the role of [[Padishah Emperor]], Hasimir became his vital adviser, often guiding him away from foolish political decisions.

During the transition of power on [[Arrakis]] between [[House Harkonnen]] and [[House Atreides]], Fenring served as interim Governor, no doubt finalizing some of the elements that would later be instrumental in the fall of House Atreides.

Between [[10191 AG]] and [[10193 AG]] he served as [[Siridar-Absentia]] of [[Caladan]]. Fenring tried to free Shaddam from the Landsraad's suspicions after the Arrakis Affair. It cost more than a billion [[solari]]s in spice bribes, slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank.

In [[10193 AG]] Fenring refused Shaddam's order to kill [[Paul Atreides]] and followed him in exile on [[Salusa Secundus]] where he spent the last 32 years of his life.

==Appearance==
Hasimir Fenring was a small, short man with a weaselish, ferret-like face with overlarge dark eyes and gray at the temples.

Caladan
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
{{FeaturedArticle}}

{{Quote|May you die on Caladan!|Ancient drinking toast|Heretics of Dune}}

'''Caladan''', later renamed '''Dan''', was the third planet orbiting the star [[Delta Pavonis]]. It was a lush oceanic world, and the ancestral home of [[House Atreides]]. 

==History==
Caladan was the fiefdom of [[House Atreides]]. It was the birthplace of Duke [[Leto Atreides I]], [[Paul Atreides]], and most of Paul's ancestors that had been heads of House Atreides and rulers of the planet. The Atreides' traditional seat was [[Castle Caladan]].

In [[10191 AG]], House Atreides was ordered to relinquish the fief of Caladan, which had been the family's home for more than 10,000 years. Instead, they were to take control of the fief of [[Arrakis]], which had previously been managed by [[House Harkonnen]], the ancient Atreides enemy.

After the Atreides moved to Arrakis, [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring]] was named [[Siridar-Absentia]] of Caladan. However, when House Atreides ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] in [[10193 AG]] following the [[Arrakis Revolt]], Caladan once again came under the direct rule of the Atreides. This time, however, the fiefdom of Caladan was given to [[Gurney Halleck]], who Paul trusted to rule in his absence.

After Paul had been Emperor for a year, he and Jessica made a trip back to Caladan to be officially welcomed as the new ruler of the [[Known Universe]].

In the 5000 years between the events of the Arrakis Revolt and the time the [[Lost Ones]] returned from [[The Scattering]], Caladan's name was shortened to [[Dan]], and all things pertaining to Dan were known as ''Danian''.

==Environment==
The environment of Caladan was largely focused around rain being a common feature of the planet's meteorology. At numerous times, both Paul and Jessica told stories of how water would fall from the skies in abundance. The landscape, as a result, was scattered with rivers and mountains and hosted a diverse and complex underwater ecosystem. Presumably, although never stated, this complex ecosystem extended to land.

== Economy and Culture ==
Caladan maintained a large agricultural industry. Under the Atreides, the planet's economy flourished through orchards (some of which were part of the Atreides family holdings), as well as exports of [[pundi rice]] and fine [[wine]]s. Since much of the planet was ocean, a significant amount of trade on the planet was based on fishing. Indeed, fishing was such a large industry on Caladan that it became ingrained into the culture of its people. Any view of the sea from the coastline would frequently be dotted with fishing trawlers.

=== Governance and Military ===
The [[House|Great House]] of Atreides ruled all aspects of Caladan and maintained it as a Duchy and [[fief|siridar fief]] under the [[Imperium]]. The Atreides ruled Caladan through dominance of both the sea and the air, while maintaining a regular standing army that was fiercely loyal. However, shortly before leaving for Arrakis, the Atreides had managed to train a small, elite force that was comparable in ability to the Imperial [[Sardaukar]] forces.

In 10,191AG House Atreides was ordered to relinquish the fief of Caladan, which had been the family's home for more than 10,000 years. Instead, they were to take control of the fief of [[Arrakis]], which had previously been managed by [[House Harkonnen]], the ancient Atreides enemy. In their stead, [[Hasimir Fenring]] assumed siridar-absentia of Caladan, however seldom ruled from Caladan itself.

After the [[Desert War]] in 10193AG, Caladan would later come under the rule of House Atreides once again. [[Gurney Halleck]] was given its fief, and shortly after, Jessica would return to Caladan accompanied by her son, Paul, to consecrate his leadership among the Imperium.

==Differences with Arrakis==
Upon their arrival on Arrakis, House Atreides was forced to undergo a significant adjustment, since their ancestral home had been one of lush greenery, large oceans, and rainfall. In contrast to this, Arrakis was a dry, hot and barren land. Early during Atreides rule of Arrakis, the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] experienced severe homesickness for Caladan, and did not believe that he would ever be able to call Arrakis his home. In order to ease their crossing, the Duke brought with him many artefacts and foodstuffs from Caladan, so that he, his family, and his men could gain some comfort in the uncertainty that was brought on by the change of fief and subsequent massive migration.

The [[Fremen]] of Arrakis appeared to be intrigued by stories of Caladan, since open, large bodies of water and rainfall had been considered a myth by those people for many generations. Moreover, Paul Atreides' seeming ability to know the ways of the desert as if native to them was made more significant by the fact that he had been raised on the lush, wet world of Caladan, where deserts were unknown.

Arrakeen
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:51aAwqrLDpL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Arrakeen as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

'''Arrakeen''', later known as '''Onn''' and then '''Keen''', was one of the largest cities on the desert planet [[Arrakis]], and its seat of power.

<br />

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the [[Atreides]] on Arrakis, the Emperor's right-hand man Count [[Hasimir Fenring]] and his wife [[Margot Fenring|Margot]] had resided in the palace. [[Leto Atreides I|Leto I]] had chosen Arrakeen for his seat of government because it was small, easier to sterilize and defend.

Arrakeen would go through multiple transformations over time; it first became an Imperial capital of staggering proportions under [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Paul Muad'Dib]]. It was later transformed into a festival city known as Onn, explicitly for the worship of the God-Emperor [[Leto II]]. Finally, in the centuries after his death, it was known as Keen, a modern (though still impressive) city to house the [[Rakian Priesthood|Priesthood of Rakis]].

During the time of the [[Faufreluches]], the city was where the ruling family maintained its household. After the death of Leto II, the city fell under the control of the Priesthood whose deity was the [[God-Emperor]]. Even though the Imperium was no more, the city remained an important political centre due to its concentration of those who worshipped the God-Emperor, as well as acting as the administration centre for [[spice]] mining operations.

The [[Bene Gesserit]], the [[Fish Speakers]], and other groups maintained a presence there in various forms.

==Description==
It was located near the northern pole of the planet, and sat largely on a mass of bedrock. This, in conjunction with the protection afforded by the [[Shield Wall]], prevented any incursions from [[Sandworm|sandworms]].

Aside from providing the governing influence with a base of operations, the chief activities in Arrakeen were trade with off-world groups and individuals, and as a gathering point for some [[Fremen]] who preferred a more 'cultured' or exotic life.

During the time of the [[Lost Ones]] were returning from the [[Scattering]], the city's name had become shortened to Keen.

Shield Wall
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Dune-ccg-judge-change-starter-deck_1_d88ab6e287c17f4427a850cc31342126-1.jpg|thumb|328px|The Shield Wall as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

The '''Shield Wall''' was a mountainous, rocky geographic feature in the northern reaches of [[Arrakis]]. It protected a small area from the full force of the planet's [[Coriolis Storm|coriolis storms]]. Its height was said to be great.

Although the Shield Wall was not man-made, it kept out the force of [[coriolis storm]]s and kept the [[sandworms]] away from human settlements.

When Paul Atreides stopped all spice production on [[Arrakis]], Emperor [[Shaddam IV]] traveled to Arrakis to restore spice production and stop Paul. He arrived in a [[Starship Lighter]] with a Hutment full of [[Sardaukar]] and landed within the Shield Wall.

When Paul's Fremen forces attacked the Sardaukar, Paul used the Family [[Atomics]] to blow an opening in the Shield Wall, breaching it. Through the breach, Fremen [[wormrider]]s poured in to the theatre, attacking and defeating the [[Sardaukar]] on the [[Plains of Arrakeen]].

In the thousands of years that passed after the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], the Shield Wall slowly crumbled. With the massive terraforming that took place on Arrakis during that time, the Shield Wall eventually was reduced to little more than a small plateau. It was within this plateau that the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]] discovered [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]]'s [[spice hoard]].

== Locations ==
The Shield Wall protected many important locations for the [[Fremen]] and [[graben]] peoples of Arrakis. They included:

* '''[[Arrakeen]]''': The capital city of Arrakis under [[House Atreides]]. It remained the capital when [[House Harkonnen]] recaptured Arrakis, and was well as when [[Paul Atreides]] wrested the planet back into Atreides hands, became Emperor and moved the royal seat from [[Kaitain]] to [[Arrakis]].
* '''[[Carthag]]''': The capital city of Arrakis when the House Harkonnen maintained the fief, a period of approximately 80 years, until 10,191AG.
* '''[[Skull Tomb]]''': The crypt where the remains of [[Leto Atreides I|Leto the Just]] were laid to rest by [[Paul Atreides]], his son.
* '''[[Plains of Arrakeen]]''': The battlefield where [[Muad'Dib]]'s armies defeated [[Shaddam Corrino IV]]'s [[Sardaukar]].

Zensunni
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:C306782831b898192fcecff680c9e755.jpg|thumb|Rogue Zensunni -Fanart]]


'''Zensunni''' was a religious belief system prominent with many cultures spread across the [[Known Universe]], especially those descended from disadvantaged and enslaved peoples.

== History ==

Little is known of the evolution of the Zensunni faith. What is beyond doubt is that the Zensunni belief was an amalgam of two ancient religions: ''Sunni Islam'' and ''Zen Buddhism''.

They were followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of [[Maometh]] (the so-called "[[Third Muhammed]]") about [[1381 BG]]. The Zensunni religion is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to "the ways of the fathers." Most scholars name [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] as leader of the original schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male spokesman for his second wife, [[Nisai]] <ref> '''''[[Dune]]''''', '''Termiology of the Imperium, page 345'''</ref>.

The Zennsunni faith was based on the teachings of the [[Ulema]] and thought to have it's origins in the [[fiqh]]. It was partially preserved in the [[Book of Kreos]] and the [[Shah-Nama]]. One of the zensunni names of [[god]] was [[al-mutakallim]], they also believed in a number of [[kiswa]] such as [[Auliya]], the female at the left hand of God, [[shaitan]] and his realm of [[Gehenna]]. One [[Zensunni Philosopher]] of note was [[Bu Ji]].

Later, the Zensunni predisposition was manipulated by the [[Bene Gesserit]], via their [[Missionaria Protectiva]] arm and [[Panoplia Propheticus]] strategy, for their own political objectives. One of the most prominent homes of Zensunni beliefs, [[Arrakis]], was of particular interest in this regard. The exclusivity of the critical [[Spice Melange]] on the planet made the resident [[Fremen]], staunch followers of Zensunni, of natural interest to the Bene Gesserit.

The emergence of the powerful [[Paul Atreides]], and his adoption of Fremen ways, gave Zensunni beliefs a dramatic new popularity. After his ascension to [[Emperor]] Paul embarked on a ferocious jihad that brought great violence and turmoil. The stark contrast of these actions vis-à-vis pacifist Zensunni beliefs was not lost on some of the faithful.

== See Also ==
* [[Budislamic]]
* [[Nilotic al-Ourouba]]
* [[Wandering Zensunni]]
* [[Zenshiite]]
* [[Zensufi]]

==Notes==

*Zensunnism usually is interpreted as a hybrid religion of Sunnitic Islam and Zen-Buddhism, however in Islam Sunna usually refers to the Sunna or example of the Prophet Mohammed, which does not seem to play a large role at all within either original Zensunni nor later Fremen religion just as both seem to contain very little obvious Buddhist elements.
*Sunna may refer to Usus, consense or tradition, even local tribal tradition within arabic culture, Zen refers to practices of insight and self-control. Indeed Fremen society relied much on both, tribal tradition and practices of harsh discipline and  self-control.
*Despite many arabic names and quotes Fremen and Zensunni faith share very little similarities with orthodox islam.In many aspects they are closer to rather marginal esoteric schools of Islam or even classic Gnosticism and perhaps pre-islamic arabic-pagan traditions. Maybe the so-called [[third islamic movement]], perhaps already the [[second islamic movement]], had abandoned much of traditional [[terra]]n islam of the [[First Islam]] movement and replaced it with esoteric teachings and practices drawn from zen-buddhist self-control and immersion techniques as well as rather abstract and removed notions of god.
*"[[Zensunni Catholicism]]" was one of the main religious groups who contributed to the [[Orange Catholic Bible]].It is however unknown what Zensunni Catholicism exactly refers to. While Many readers interpret it as a blend of Zensunnism with catholic christianity it might also refer to a universal or holistic Zensunnism.

'''Poritrin''' was the third planet in the star system [[Epsilon Alangue]], and an established but largely quiet agricultural world within the [[Known Universe]].

It was, according to [[Zensunni]] beliefs, the home world of the [[Zensunni Wanderers]], though genetic testing has suggestions that Zensunni origins were from another planet and far more ancient.

Poritrin was a source of resources for the [[Imperium]]. The [[Fremen]] remembered Poritrin as their planet of origin in their songs.

Rossak

The planet '''Rossak''' was the fifth planet in the star system [[HD95424]]. It was the fourth stop of [[Zensunni Wanderers]] during their forced migration times, and where a [[Awareness spectrum narcotic]] that released the [[Other Memories]] of their [[Sayyadina]]s was discovered.


==Notoriety==
In [[10191 AG]], the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] experienced memories of Rossak when she underwent the [[spice agony]] on [[Arrakis]]. During the ceremony, Jessica successfully changed the [[Water of Life]] poison, thus unlocking her [[Other Memory|Other memories]]. It was during the induced trance that she recalled moments, through Other Memory, of the original [[Zensunni Wanderers]] on the planet [[Poritrin]], as well as [[Zensunni]] women taking [[awareness spectrum narcotics]] that unlocked [[genetic memory]] for the first time.

The Fremen of Arrakis would recall the raiders pursuing them on Rossak, through courtyards lush with greenery. This recollection would normally take place during a ceremony, along with the raids on Poritrin and [[Bela Tegeuse]]. The ceremony would normally involve the [[Sayyadina]], and the words ''"We will never forgive and we will never forget"''.

==History==
Rossak was once visited by the [[Zensunnis]], but they eventually were expelled by raiders.

Bashar (بشار) is an Arabic proper name, it means "bringer of glad tidings". It is not known if the rank title is related to the name. If so, then by the time when Dune takes place, it may have become implicit that "good tidings" here referred to winning a battle.

Other cognates include Turkic "pasha, paşa, başa" which means "lord, governor, general, great chief." Therefore, the usage "Colonel Bashar," very strongly suggests the Eastern Bloc military rank "Colonel-General" -- it does not have an exact Western equivalent, but is roughly "three-star general of ground forces," between a two-star Major General and a four-star General. The rank would thus be "a fractional point above Colonel" just as described.

Nations that have histories of using the rank of "Colonel-General" and continue to do so as of the 21st century include China, the former Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, and others.

She and her father act as guardians for [[Leto II Atreides]] while he stays in custody of [[Gurney Halleck]], and she nurses him when he is forced to undergo a spice trance. In the trance Leto foresees that he and Sabiha could become lovers in the future, but chooses to avoid this path in order to realize his own destiny and, after telling her of the vision, sending her into a confusion, sends her to sleep before escaping. They later meet again at Shuloch, where Sabiha is surprised to find him alive (he left into the desert with a sabotaged [[stillsuit ]] in the midst of a sandstorm) and resentful to him for disgracing her and causing her banishment from Fondak. She later recognised his genuine feelings for her when he cried for the future with her he had forsaken at the goading of [[Muriz]].

She was one of the first to see Leto's new skills at the beginning of his transformation.

Twelve years after [[Paul Atreides]]'s ascension to the [[Golden Lion Throne]], [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], [[Edric]], [[Gaius Helen Mohiam|Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam]], and [[Scytale]] met on Wallach IX, consipiring to destroy the House of Atreides. Irulan wanted to bear the royal heir, Edric wanted to break [[House Atreides|Atreides]] monopoly on spice, and Gaius Helen Mohiam wanted the Atriedes bloodline back under [[Bene Gesserit]] control. Scytale revealed that the [[Tleilaxu]] had created a [[ghola]] called [[Hayt]] that was a copy of [[Duncan Idaho]].

A [[Mentat]] [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]] visited '''Wallach IX''' during the time of [[God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]]'s reign to suppress a Mentat-school the Sisterhood had thought they had hidden there.

Millennia later, a [[Bene Gesserit]] Council on Wallach IX filed formal protest against [[House Corrino]] in assassination of Leto Atreides II.

Centuries after the Fall of the God Emperor, during the onslaught of the [[Honored Matres]], Wallach IX is attacked by forces from [[Scattering|the Scattering]], and either subjugated or completely destroyed (according to a report received by the [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama]]).

When brought before Alia, she was about to send him to the dungeons when he protested loudly "the injustice of the Atreides." Upon hearing this, Alia came to regard Paymon as bold and therefore potentially useful. She hired him on retainer. However, shortly after leaving the [[Judgement Hall]], [[Javid]] reported to Alia that Paymon was heard uttering a phrase from the [[Orange Catholic Bible]]: ''"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."'' Upon hearing this, Alia flew into a rage and ordered Paymon's immediate execution, his water to be reclaimed by the [[Fremen]] [[deathstill]].

Sheeana Brugh
{{Or-DE,Ex}}
[[Image:sheeana.jpg|thumb|Sheeana Brugh and the Sandworms]]
'''Sheeana Brugh''' (b. 15218 AG) was a [[Fremen]] during the time of the return from the [[Scattering]]. She came to the attention of the [[Rakian Priesthood]], the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Bene Tleilax]] because it was discovered that the [[sandworm|worms]] of Rakis obeyed her.

== Early Life ==

[[File:Img167.jpg|thumb|Sheeana - Illustration by Klaus D.Schiemann]]

Sheeana was raised by her parents in a shanty town on the outskirts of [[Arrakeen|Keen]] on [[Arrakis|Rakis]]. When she was eight years of age her town was destroyed by a worm. Sheeana watched from a distance as her parents and fellow villagers were killed. When Sheeana approached the worm that orphaned her, she was not killed by the creature. Instead, she discovered that the worm obeyed her.

Shortly thereafter, Sheanna found herself at the city of Keen. She was led there by a worm after she climbed atop of it. Upon her arrival at Keen the Rakian Priesthood adopted the girl and obeyed her every whim.

== Involvement with the Bene Gesserit ==
[[Image:Sheeana Fremen.jpg|thumb|left|Sheeana, from the Russian cover of ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'']]
Some years later, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood took an interest in her, in order to fulfill a plan orchestrated by the Sisterhood to propagate the worms on their [[Chapterhouse]] planet. The Bene Gesserit eventually made Sheeana a sister, although her Fremen upbringing and an early exposure to [[Honored Matres|Honored Matre]] sexual practices (courtesy of the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]]) made her an unpredictable element within the Sisterhood.

Bene Gesserit analysis of her DNA revealed that Sheeana was a descendant of [[Siona Atreides]] and [[Duncan Idaho]]. This, according to the Sisterhood's theories, was the reason why the worms obeyed her. It was also how the Sisterhood used her to lure a worm into a [[no-ship]], just before the sterilization of the surface of Rakis by the [[Honored Matres]]. From there it made its way to Chapterhouse where it was to be re-seeded.

== Escape ==
Having grown unhappy with her involvement with the Bene Gesserit, and after striking up a friendship with the Sisterhood's [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]], Sheeana escaped in a [[no-ship]] with Duncan, the imprisoned [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] Master [[Scytale]], Ghola Teg, The Rabbi's Party (including Rebecca), some proctor Bene Gesserits and some [[sandworms]]. Their escape occurred during the turmoil of the Bene Gesserit-[[Honored Matres]] merger, and saw them journey beyond the [[known universe]] into uncharted territory, as the Bene Gesserit splinter group searched for a new home.

Others however were the descendants of Settlers from other [[planet]]s, Fortune Hunters or [[Harkonnen]] retainers who had been transferred to [[Dune]] by their Masters. Of course the inhabitants of the Pyon villages and [[Garrison towns]] saw their remote relatives as feral, outlawed, uncivilized and brutal while the Fremen considered the Settlers softened and "water fat".

'''House Ordos''' was a mercantile Great [[House]] whose home was an ice-covered planet, Sigma Draconis 4, in the [[Stars#Sigma Draconis|Sigma Draconis]] star system. House Ordos was most famous for its smuggling of forbidden [[Ixian]] technologies into their home planet, and for the wealth that makes them paranoid, but powerful.

==Origins==

The Ordos perhaps have their ancient [[Earth]] origins in [[Wikipedia:China|China]], since their family name is the same as that of the [[Wikipedia:Ordos Desert|Ordos Desert]].

The economy of their planet is based entirely on trade and smuggling. They were insidious and had a tendency towards sabotage, expensive weaponry, and illegal technologies imported from [[Ix]].

==Leadership==

Ordos seemed to have formed by a reclusive cartel of wealthy noblemen who seem to control the finances of House Ordos, and thus, House Ordos itself. No one has ever seen them except the few generals who formerly controlled what troops the Ordos could muster.

One by one, those noblemen generals have been eliminated under mysterious circumstances and were replaced by the [[Executrix]] whose origins are not known.

==History==

House Ordos represented one of the most greedy and selfish [[Great Houses]] in the [[Imperium]]; their only goal was to generate revenue to sustain the pluto/technocratic elite of the House, who, to this end, have fine tuned the House to an inhumanly specific degree.

House Ordos were driven in all they endeavor to do by a calculated and single-minded mandate to destroy anything that stands between them and the most valuable substance in the known universe. They gained immense wealth that bought them incredibly powerful forbidden technologies and weapons mainly from the house of Ix. Aside from wealth, there
was little military strength to House Ordos, relying mostly to mercenaries (who tended to desert with great frequency).

The House faced stiff competition for the [[spice]] in [[Arrakis]]. After the [[First Spice War]] they gained the technology to make [[ghola]] slave soldiers from the corpses of fallen enemies and hired a new Strategist.

During the war they intended to create a [[ghola]] of the deceased Emperor [[Frederick IV]], who would serve as a puppet emperor subservient to them. For that end they were trying to manipulate many of the factions of the [[Second Spice War]] (Fremen, Sardaukar, Smugglers) into conflict with any of the major house.

Their strategy was using gholas and other forms of treachery to thwart any attempts at alliance among their enemies and secure alliances for them.

==Behind the Scenes==
House Ordos first appeared in [[The Dune Encyclopedia]], but is never mentioned in any of the novels. However it does figure prominently in the [[Dune II (video game)|Dune game series]] released by Westwood Studios. Westwood chose to replace the Ordos ivy and crossbones coat-of-arms with the book and serpent symbol, though, which, according to the Encyclopedia, belongs to [[House Wallach]].

No Rooms use the [[Holtzman Effect |Holzmann effect]] to hide everything inside from prescient vision. Developed by the Ixians and Leto II, either seperately or as a result of one another. In the case of the Ixians they were developed alongside the [[no-ship|No- ship]], a ship that wouldn't require spice or guild navigators to operate. 



==Ixian No-rooms ==
No-rooms were originally designed by the Ixians for the ability to hide objects and people from prescient sight (Leto II). They created [[Hwi Noree]] in a no- room as part of their plan to destroy Leto's empire.  



==Leto II's No-room ==
At [[Dar-es-Balat]] , the site of old Sietch Tabr and the village Tabur, Leto's spice hoard and journals were found in this no room. 




==Harkonnen No globes==
Harkonnen No-rooms are found on the planet [[Gammu]] (Giedi Prime). Aparently they were used by the Harknonnens to hide from the outside universe during the reign of Leto II. The No globe becomes an important

Botanical testing station
The '''Botanical testing stations''' were scientific structures on [[Arrakis]].The oldest ones were ancient facilities built by the first imperial prospectors and Explorers and later long forgotten.Many had since become home to Outlaw clans of [[Zensunni]] Renegades who had turned them into early [[sietches]].Others were built later by the [[Planetologist]]s [[Pardot Kynes|Pardot]] and [[Liet Kynes]].The Botanical testing stations provided the early [[Fremen]] with knowledge and equipment to built their own [[Windtrap]]s and secret [[palmeries]].

Garrison town
The '''Garrison Towns''' were the few somewhat bigger settlements on [[Arrakis]] northern hemisphere.In contrast to the poorer [[Pyon]] villages of the [[Graben, Sink and Pan]] -folk, here most "[[outworlder]]s" lived. These towns were fortified, against "[[Fremen]] riffraff and [[sand pirates]]", [[Smugglers]] and the occasional daring Offworlder [[Razzia]]s.

The Garrison towns not only housed most of the [[Military]] and [[Mercenaries]] but also [[Technician]]s, beaurocrats and [[Spice mining]] facilities, though the best [[Dune Men]], [[Sand Worker]]s, [[Spice drivers]], [[Sandmaster]]s and [[Spice-hunter]]s still came from the [[Pyon]]s and were often at good terms or even distantly akin to the more northern and sociable Fremen.

Azhar Book
{{Or-DE,Ex|Azhar Book}}

[[File:IrulanCorrino1.jpg|thumb]]


The '''Azhar Book''' is a [[Bene Gesserit]] compilation of religious and bibliographic information. Supposedly it preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths.

It was a bibliographic marvel that preserved the great secrets of the most ancient faiths, even before the [[Orange Catholic Bible]]. The creation of the Azhar Book is also attributed to the [[Bene Gesserit]].

==History==
The manual included in a [[Fremen]] desert survival kit on [[Arrakis]] said: 
{{quote|Manual of 'The Friendly Desert,' the place full of life. Here are the [[ayat]] and [[burhan]] of Life. Believe, and [[al-Lat]] shall never burn you.|[[Fremkit]] manual}}

As [[Jessica Atreides]] noted, it read like the Azhar Book'', understanding that a Manipulator of Religions had been on Arrakis referring to the [[Missionaria Protectiva]].

[[Leto Atreides II]] quoted from the Azhar Book when discussing with [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] their suspicions about their aunt [[Alia Atreides|Alia]]:
{{quote|It is with reason and terrible experience that we call the pre-born [[Abomination]]. For who knows what lost and damned persona out of our evil past may take over the living flesh?|Azhar Book}}

Leto later noted that the watering-place of [[St. Thomas]] was preserved in the [[Orange Catholic Bible]] and the Azhar Book. 

==Paul Atreides and the Azhar Book==
[[Paul Atreides|Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides]] said words traced back to ancient texts of the Azhar Book:

:Muad'Dib: "Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future."
:C.E.T. Commentaries: Identical wording. (The Azhar Book traces this statement to the first century religious writer, [[Neshou]]; through a paraphrase.)

:Muad'Dib: "If a child, an untrained person, an ignorant person, or an insane person incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not predicting and preventing that trouble."
:O.C. Bible: "Any sin can be ascribed, at least in part, to a natural bad tendency that is an extenuating circumstance acceptable to God." (The Azhar Book traces this to the ancient [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah Semitic Tawra].)

:Muad'Dib: "Reach forth thy hand and eat what God has provided thee; and when thou are replenished, praise the Lord."
:O.C. Bible: a paraphrase with identical meaning. (The Azhar Book traces this in slightly different form to [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam First Islam].)

==Contents==
*It is with reason and terrible experience that we call the pre-born [[Abomination]]. For who knows what lost and damned persona out of our evil past may take over the living flesh?
*The one-eyed view of our universe says you must not look far afield for problems. Such problems may never arrive. Instead, tend to the wolf within your fences. The packs ranging outside may not even exist. <br /> &mdash; The Azhar Book; [[Shamra]] I:4 (''[[Children of Dune]]'')

Ducal ring
[[File:51BJITHPYML._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb]]


The '''Ducal ring''' was a large signet ring worn as a symbol of office by the Duke of [[House Atreides]].  As seen in the 1984 movie, the ring was an item that [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] coveted, swearing that after killing Duke [[Leto Atreides I]], he would have the ring as a trophy.  When Leto Atriedes was poisoned by [[Wellington Yueh]], Yueh took the ring with the intention of giving it to Paul.  Baron Harkonnen was annoyed with [[Piter de Vries]] for killing Yueh before finding out where the ring was located.

[[Paul Atreides]] wore the ring after he and his mother Jessica escaped into the Deep Desert of Arrakis, both as a tribute to his dead father, and as a rallying symbol to the Fremen.

The ring itself is ovoid in shape, with a large crimson inset.  The inset carries an impression of the Atreides Coat of Arms.

So, while leaving Chapterhouse, the no-ship was located by the [[Net, the|Net]] of the two mysterious old man and woman: [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]].

He was held captive by Paul and his [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]], and was later used as an Atreides messenger to [[House Corrino/DE|House Corrino]]. He was returned to [[Salusa Secundus/DE|Salusa Secundus]] in disgrace for failing his mission, and allowing himself to be captured.

He became obsessed with his failure and with his cowardly refusal to commit suicide when captured by the Fremen. His guilt led to his authorship of ''[[The Sardaukar Strike]]'' ([[Salusa Secundus: Ogden]]) a manic and highly jingoistic history of the soldier-fanatics.

More significantly, he founded an extremist group of disenchanted Sardaukar, known as the "[[Final Force]]", which advocated a return to the spartan regimen of past glories. 

Aramsham died a bitter man, feeling that he had never atoned for his sin. The circumstances of his death are uncertain, but one record indicates he committed ritual suicide. A less acceptable account indicates in [[10196 AG]] he attacked [[Hasimir Fenring/DE|Count]] and [[Margot Fenring/DE|Lady Fenring]] as they returned from Rakis with the deposed [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]] and died from his wounds. However, the time involved make his death at such an early date unlikely.

Starship Lighter

A '''Starship Lighter''' or '''Space Lighter''' was a barge-like [[Spaceship]] usually employed to transfer goods or passengers from and between greater Transports or [[Heighliner]]s. Practically the term could refer to a great number of quite unlike starcraft, from small Spice Lighters, used to transport [[Melange]] to greater Freight Lighters or even great capital ships such as [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] personal royal spaceship, which was a combination of Lighter, mobile Palace and army Command centre and featured a Hutment of nine interlocking metal leaves that reached out in a thousand-meter circle and could house five [[legion]]s of [[Sardaukar]].

Net, the
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:9780425092149-uk-1.jpg|thumb]]

The '''net''' was an instrument of particle manipulation and envelopment developed by the Outside [[Enemy]], Daniel and Marty. 

When the captured gholas of [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Miles Teg]], [[Scytale]]; [[Sheeana]] and her ultra-orthodox [[Bene Gesserit]] sisters left [[Chapterhouse]], the elderly couple [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] tried to ensnare the no-ship with their net. The net appeared as a series of non-organic gossamer strands that slowly wrapped itself around the ship, getting stronger as time passed. Eventually it would have encompassed itself completely around the giant structure and trapped those inside, had not Duncan Idaho folded space to escape.

== Behind the Scenes ==
In Chapterhouse Dune ''"Tachyon theory"'' is mentioned in connection with [[Tio Holtzman|Holtzman]]'s "original design", however he calls his power source techys, not tachyons. Duncan concludes that ''"someone 'out there'"'' has discovered a new application for Holtzman's theories - this could imply the existence of a Tachyon Net, however it is never mentioned by that name by Frank Herbert.

Return of the Honored Matres
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:9788473863483-uk-1.jpg|thumb|Heretics of Dune book cover]]

The '''Return of the Honored Matres''' (in [[15229 AG]]) referred to the arrival of the [[Honored Matres]] from uncharted space into the [[known universe]], or the [[Old Empire]].

== The Scattering ==
The group's emergence saw them come into direct contact with the [[Bene Gesserit]], one of the groups from whom they had evolved in the turmoil of [[the Scattering]]. (Others included the [[Fish Speakers]] and women of the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]].) They came with formidable military forces which they had built up in the previous thousand years, and overpowered numerous worlds weakened by the erosion of many established political players. One such world was the planet [[Junction]], which the Honored Matres captured from the [[Spacing Guild]].

After subjugating both the Spacing Guild and the [[Bene Tleilax]], the Honored Matres embarked on an aggressive campaign to destroy, and before doing so, learn the knowledge of the Bene Gesserit. However, their plans of destruction failed, and the two groups effectively merged under the leadership of [[Murbella]], as [[Mother Commander]] of both organizations. This outcome effectively marked the end of the Honored Matres' return to the known universe.

Voice
[[File:51oT6J972oL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb|Bene Gesserit using the Voice as depicted in the Dune CCG|250px]]{{Or-DE,Ex}}
'''Voice''' was an audio-neuro control mechanism that enabled the manipulation of speech to achieve complete control over a receiver. It was perfected by the [[Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit Sisterhood]] through the combined training of several advanced techniques.

==Application of Voice==
Use of Voice allowed a Bene Gesserit adept to gain control over uninitiated victims merely by altering the tonal qualities of the voice. Simple instructions or orders were then spoken in Voice and obeyed dutifully.

Voice was most often used to compel a typically unwilling person to do something undesirable or to glean the truth from an unwilling recipient.

==Resistance to Voice==
With sufficient natural ability and training one could become more resistant to the effects of Voice, as was most famously seen with [[Paul Atreides]], who taught this to Duncan Idaho, who eventually became immune to Voice. Other methods of resistance came through technology, such as the [[Cone of Silence]].

Nonetheless, other skilled persons were known to have a particular resistance to the Voice. When threatened by [[Gurney Halleck]], Jessica considered using the Voice, but remarked that it would be too difficult and futile given Halleck's experience and talents. She was more than likely referring to some innate ability to resist the Voice through years of conditioning.

==Possibilities of use==
[[File:Dune (2000) - Lady Jessica using the voice against Jamis|thumb|Lady Jessica using the "Voice".]]
The foremost use of the Voice was the subtle (but forced) manipulation of a person into doing as they were told. Whilst not its primary use, the [[Bene Gesserit]] would also use the Voice for interrogation of their prisoners.  

[[Jessica Atreides]] had considered the possibility of using Voice on the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] to make certain decisions regarding the welfare of [[House Atreides]] upon their move from [[Caladan]] to [[Arrakis]]. She had surmised that she could use Voice in the most subtle ways imaginable, so that the Duke would think that he was making such choices of his own volition. However, The Lady Jessica knew that were she to do so, it would be a gross violation of his trust, even if it meant that they would save House Atreides in the process.

Some people had the ability to use Voice without formal training, such as [[Sheeana Brugh]], who learned to master this natural talent as she grew to adulthood.

'''Gladiators''' usually were members of the [[Slave]]-class of the [[Faufreluches]], trained to fight in the [[planet]]ary Arenas for entertainment of the Nobility and the crowds. These Gladiators were often drawn from prisoners of war and usually [[drug]]ged by means of [[Elacca]], especially when set up against free Arena-fighters.

After the subjugation of [[Arrakis]] by the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]], [[House Atreides|Atreides]] warriors re-entered into the arena for the entertainment of the nobility. A fight featuring [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen|Feyd-Rautha]] describes a meeting with an Atreides soldier who had carved the Eagle of Atreides into his flesh and his subsequent death when Feyd cheats by using a code word to paralyze the soldier and by having poison on the black blade, rather than the white one.

Zensunni Catholicism

==Behind the Scenes==

It is unknown if or in how Zensunni Catholicism differed from the original [[Zensunni]] teachings or the religion of the [[Wandering Zensunni]].It's inclusion into the Orange Catholic Establishment seems to imply that it was widely accepted and not a persecuted or opressed faith.

The term "Zensunni catholicism" is often interpreted as a possible syncretism between Zensunnism and [[Catholic Christianity]], though the term could also imply a Universal or holistic Zensunnism in contrast to the rather sectarian beliefs of the Wandering Zensunni.

Hi, thanks for your effort in categorizing the articles, but why did you move all "males" to "male characters"? The former is preferable and it took me some time and effort to move most of the latter to the former, about the same effort as you did now. I'd prefer if you reverted them back. :( '''MoffRebus'''<sup>[[User_talk:MoffRebus|My Talk]]</sup> 07:35, November 10, 2009 (UTC)

Hi again. Sorry for the late reply but I wanted to finish some other stuff before coming back to this discussion. Thanks for your help on tidying the wiki, I never bothered hunting down broken redirects or uncategorised files and templates before. Now as for the gender categories, I am very much used to Wookieepedia style (many wikis including this one owe much to the Wookieepedia principles). Wookieepedia has an in-universe context, therefore all characters are treated as individuals. The word "Characters" while would be appropriate for Wikipedia, is not needed for a fictional world wiki since (almost) every single one of the individuals mentioned is, well, a book character. Now, I like how the Fallout wiki organize the game characters (I guess you are referring to this "Characters by..." idea). Fallout is intended to be used something like as a game-guide or an index which is not very necessary for Dune but for now characters here are already divided by gender, religion and affiliation, and perhaps we ought to include planet of origin as well? What else? '''MoffRebus'''<sup>[[User_talk:MoffRebus|My Talk]]</sup> 12:23, November 15, 2009 (UTC)

== Templates ==

Yeah, I was thinking about that myself. Moff is our glorious leader, but yeah go for it.

Another thing I was thinking about is that it might be worth bringing the old templates (big bold writing and a defined border (eg. [[Template:Unknown]]) into line with the newer ones - ie: no border, smaller text, bit less bold.

I also did some messing about a while back with a new template for when we get around to portalling up the wiki and splitting some of the more contentious nu-vs.-classic articles. Something like [[User:DuneFish/test1]] (edit: Just done them properly), if we're doing a template-a-thon, have a look - particularly the div code stuff if you know anything about it.. my understanding of that stuff is a bit sketchy.

::(I'm half tempted to say see what they look like in #c7cbcb (The light grey on bits of the theme), but it's not very eye-grabbing.)

::Re: Template design, I was thinking of using the template as-is ie. not typing anything in - there'll be a big page title right next to it, I don't think it's all that necessary. The not using the PAGENAME was intentional, because the "Caladan/DE" page has a PAGENAME of "Caladan/DE" and I can't think of a way to loose the "/DE" off the end. "Caladan/DE in Original" doesn't make all that much sense... but that's something we can discuss.

'''''Dune''''' is a science fiction novel written by [[Frank Herbert]] and published in 1965. A winner of the [[Hugo Award]] and [[Nebula Award]] for outstanding science fiction, ''Dune'' is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time, and is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history. ''Dune'' spawned five sequels written by Herbert, and inspired [[Dune (1984 film)|a film adaptation]] by [[David Lynch]], two [[miniseries]] made by the United States-based [[Sci-Fi Channel]], [[Dune computer games|computer games]], another adaptation by Denis Villeneuve [part 1 in 2021, part 2 is upcoming in 2023] as well as a series of prequels, interquels, and sequels co-written by [[Brian Herbert]], the author's son, and [[Kevin J. Anderson]].

''Dune'' is set far in the future, amidst a sprawling feudal intergalactic [[Imperium|empire]], where planetary fiefdoms are controlled by Noble [[House|Houses]] that owe allegiance to the Imperial [[House Corrino]]. The novel tells the story of young [[Paul Atreides]], heir apparent to [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I]] and scion of [[House Atreides]], as he and his family relocate to the planet [[Arrakis]], the universe's only source of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. In a story that explores the complex interactions of [[politics]], [[religion]], ecology, [[technology]], and human emotion, the fate of Paul, his family, his new planet and [[Fremen|its native inhabitants]], as well as the [[Padishah Emperor]], the powerful [[Spacing Guild]], and the secretive female order of the [[Bene Gesserit]], are all drawn together into a confrontation that will change the course of [[Human|humanity]].

The novel was originally serialised in [[Analog magazine|the magazine, ''Analog'']], from 1963 to 1965 as two shorter works: ''[[Dune World]]'' and ''[[The Prophet of Dune]]''.

==Synopsis==
===Political backdrop of ''Dune''===
Opening twenty-thousand years into the future, the [[Human|human race]] has scattered throughout the galaxy, populating multiple planets ruled by aristocratic [[House|Houses]] who themselves answer to the galaxy's [[Imperial Family|Imperial family]] [[House Corrino]]. Key is the control of the desert planet [[Arrakis]], the only source of the valuable [[spice]] [[melange]], which gives those who ingest it extended life and [[Prescience|prescient awareness]]. [[Melange]] is crucial as it enables [[space travel]], which in turn is monopolized by the [[Spacing Guild]]; its [[Guild Navigator|Navigators]] use the spice to safely plot a course for the Guild ships via prescience using "[[Fold space|foldspace]]" technology, which allows instantaneous travel to anywhere in the galaxy.

Ten thousand years before the beginning of the story, the human race had purged all machines that had replicated many of the functions of the human mind. This event, known as the [[Butlerian Jihad|Butlerian Jihad,]] resulted in the destruction of all the robots, [[Computer|computers]], “[[Thinking Machines|thinking machines]],” and - significantly - the computer navigator. Subsequently, it was necessary to replace [[Starship|spaceship]] computers with the spice-addicted [[Guild Navigator]]s to allow ships to travel safely through space. The functions of the logical computers were replaced by the [[Mentat]]s, humans who, through intensive training, learned to enter a heightened mental state in which they could perform complex logical computations.

The spice is also crucial to the powerful matriarchal order called the [[Bene Gesserit]]. The secretive Bene Gesserit, often referred to as "witches", possess mental and physical powers developed through a combination of thousands of generations of genetic selection and years of physical and mental conditioning. When a Bene Gesserit [[acolyte]] becomes a full [[Reverend Mother]] by undergoing a massive overdose of specific narcotics (called "The Agony"), she gains access to her "ancestral memories" — the complete life experiences of all her female ancestors back to the point of conception. Only women have been able to survive the transformation. However, the Bene Gesserit have a secret, centuries-old breeding program to create a prescient superhuman — and male equivalent of a Reverend Mother — called the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], who would not only be able to survive The Agony, but whose “organic mental powers would bridge space and time”.

The planet Arrakis itself is completely covered in a desert ecosystem, hostile to most organic life. It is also sparsely settled by a human population of native [[Fremen]] tribes. Tribal leaders are selected by defeating the former leader in combat. The Fremen also have complex rituals and systems focusing on the value and conservation of water on their arid planet. They conserve the water distilled from their dead, consider spitting an honorable greeting, and value tears as the greatest gift one can give to the dead. Their culture also revolves around the spice, which is created as part of the life cycle of the giant [[Sandworm|sandworms]] who dominate the deserts. Bene Gesserit missionary efforts have implanted a belief in a male Messiah who will one day come and transform Arrakis into a world more hospitable to humans.

[[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] has come to fear [[House Atreides]], partly due to the growing popularity of [[Duke Leto Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides I]] and also because the talent of Leto's fighting force is beginning to rival the effectiveness of the Emperor's own dreaded Imperial [[Sardaukar]] guard. Shaddam decides that House Atreides must be destroyed, but cannot risk an attack on a single House, which would, by necessity, unite the other Houses against him. The Emperor instead uses the centuries-old feud between House Atreides and [[House Harkonnen]] to disguise his assault, enlisting the brilliant and power-hungry [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]] in his plan to trap and eliminate the Atreides. Shaddam forces Leto to accept the lucrative fief of the desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of the [[spice melange]], previously controlled by the Harkonnens. Enter into this conflict the [[Bene Gesserit]]. Their ancient breeding program, now only one generation from completion, has suddenly become horribly jeopardized: They had planned to breed an Atreides daughter with a Harkonnen son to unite the two bloodlines and produce their long-awaited superbeing, the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. However fate would decide otherwise and instead of bearing a daughter, the Bene Gesserit [[Lady Jessica]] (the Duke’s [[Concubine]]) fulfilled her beloved Duke's wishes for a son and bore [[Paul]].

Shortly after arriving on Arrakis, the Atreides are unable to withstand a devastating Harkonnen attack, supported by Imperial Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnen. Betrayed by Dr. [[Wellington Yueh|Yueh]], Duke Leto dies in a failed attempt to assassinate Baron Harkonnen; Paul and Jessica escape into the deep desert, their exit from the city guaranteed by Yueh himself. They manage to join a band of Fremen, ferocious fighters who ride the giant sandworms of Arrakis.
Paul and his mother quickly learn the ways of the Fremen, while teaching them the [[Bene Gesserit]] method of fighting. Paul leads armies of Fremen in a guerilla campaign, nearly halting spice mining on Arrakis. 

Jessica becomes a Reverend Mother, taking the Waters of Life, poison derived from the sandworms, while pregnant with her Duke’s second child. Her daughter [[Alia]] experiences all that her mother does from the poison, gaining wisdom even prior to her birth. Living on the spice diet of the [[Fremen]], Paul's prescience increases dramatically, enabling him to foresee future events and gaining him a religious respect from the Fremen, who regard him as their prophesied Messiah. As Paul grows in influence, he begins to plot revenge against the Harkonnen rule of the planet under his new [[Fremen]] name, [[Muad'Dib]].

Disturbed by his lack of complete prescience Paul decides to take the [[Water of Life]], an act that could kill him. After three weeks in a near-death state, Paul emerges as the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], with the power to see both the past, the present and the future clearly. Looking into space, he sees that the Emperor and the Harkonnens have amassed a huge armada to invade the planet and regain control. Paul also discovers the way to control spice production on Arrakis.
[[Alia]] is captured by Sardaukar and brought to the planet's capital Arrakeen by the Emperor himself. At that moment, under cover of a gigantic sandstorm, Paul and his army of [[Fremen]] attack the city. [[Alia]] kills the Baron with a poisoned needle during the confusion. Paul quickly overcomes the city's defenses and confronts the Emperor, threatening to destroy the spice and thereby effectively end space travel and cripple both the Imperial power and [[Bene Gesserit]] in one shot. Realizing that Paul is capable of doing all he has threatened, the Emperor is forced to abdicate and to promise his daughter in marriage to Paul. Paul ascends the throne, his control of [[Arrakis]] and the [[spice]] establishing a new kind of power over the Empire which will change the face of the known universe.

==Detailed Plot Summary==
The central figure of the book is [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], son and heir presumptive to [[Duke Leto Atreides]], head of the [[House Atreides]], and Leto's [[concubine]], [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]], a [[Bene Gesserit]]. The [[Bene Gesserit]] perform many functions in the Empire, as [[Truthsayer]]s (human lie detectors), negotiators, advisors, and teachers, but all these functions serve one deeper purpose: for at least ten thousand years, they have been selectively breeding humans trying to improve humanity. 

The goal of their breeding program is the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], a human being who will be aware of both maternal and paternal ancestral memories, and have prescient abilities greater than those of the Guild's navigators. The [[Bene Gesserit]] are close, they believe, to the fruition of their plan, and [[Paul Atreides]] is at the heart of it. [[Jessica]], his mother, disobeyed [[Bene Gesserit]] orders out of attachment to [[Leto Atreides]], and gave birth to a boy, [[Paul]]. Her express orders had been to produce a girl, whom the [[Bene Gesserit]] would have mated with a Harkonnen, and they hoped from this union they would produce the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. Ultimately, the change in plan causes [[Paul Atreides]] to exhibit unexpected resources, and possibilities that were unforeseen by the [[Bene Gesserit]] plan.

With House Atreides becoming increasingly more powerful within the [[Landsraad]], the [[Padishah Emperor]] concocts a plan to rid the Impreium of the great house under the guise of a Harkonnen attack. The emperor awards House Atreides with the stewardship of [[Arrakis]], a desert planet and the only source of the most valuable substance in the universe, [[Spice Melange|spice melange]]. Whilst Leto is aware that the Emperor is out to betray him, he sees Arrakis as a way to prove himself within the Landsraad and grow in power by turning around Arrakis — a feat that had not been acomplished by the Harkonnens in eight decades.

The move to Arrakis is difficult for the Atreides, and they find that the equipment left by the Harkonnens has been deliberately sabotaged in order to increase their chances of failing. Navigating the complex relationships on Arrakis too proves difficult, and it is often unknown where alliances lie. It quickly becomes clear to Jessica and the other members of the Atreides house that there are several stakeholders at play on Arrakis, among them, the powerful [[Spacing Guild]] whom have been taking bribes from the Fremen to keep Arrakis clear of sattelites.

The Harkonnen attack is more diabolical, more powerful, and comes more quickly than the Atreides expect, however The Harkonnens manage to gain a spy in the Atreides inner household, and in doing so achieve something unique in Imperial history: they break the "imperial conditioning" of a [[Suk]] doctor, which had been universally believed to make a person incapable of consciously causing physical harm. The Harkonnens bend the Atreides doctor – [[Wellington Yueh|Yueh]] – to their will by promising to release his wife from prolonged torture.

When the Harkonnens attack, Yueh lowers the defensive house shields and uses sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught. The Atreides army is crushed, with only a few remnants managing to escape.

[[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] are sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needs to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan is foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hates the Baron and wishes to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] manage to kill their captors and escape into the desert.

Yueh, eager for a shot at killing the Baron he so deeply despises and knowing he won't have the chance, plants a fake tooth in the Duke Leto's mouth. When bitten, the tooth emits a poison that will be fatal to both Leto, and hopefully, the [[Baron Harkonnen]]. When Yueh hands over Leto, [[Baron Harkonnen]] kills Yueh. Leto, still paralyzed, but conscious, attempts to kill the Baron by breaking the gas capsule, but misjudges his moment, and is only successful in killing the Baron's adviser and [[Mentat]], [[Piter de Vries]].

Paul and Jessica initially met up with Planetologist Liet Kynes and Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they are not there long before the station is attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flee to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they have died from a coriolis storm.

In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers come into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures explodes into awareness. He sees many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he can make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive.

After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] manage to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] prove their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu tralietining – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepts them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also meets a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], who dies in a spice blow after wandering through the desert having hallucinations of his father. Paul has long seen Chani in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarms a proud Fremen, Jamis, who takes offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenges Paul to a fight to the death. Superficially, this contest between a grown man and an untried fifteen-year-old boy would seem grossly unfair. But Paul had been trained by masters of the [[sword]], and although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphs easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. At the same time, Paul and Jessica are introduced to the deadly harshness of the Fremen lifestyle, as the Fremen ritually and literally render Jamis down to his water because it is so precious to them. Stilgar gives Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gives himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.

When they return to the troop's hidden cave dwelling, known as a sietch, they discover the Fremen Reverend Mother is near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they make Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. The Fremen have been so influenced by the Bene Gesserit that they attempt to emulate many of their actions with some success including the creation of Reverend Mothers. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen are about to do, accepts to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realizes she has made a mistake, that she is involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who can see genetic memories, and realizes that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, will also go through the process. This has truly unfortunate consequences, because it is a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby will not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.

Years pass. Paul Muad'dib learns to be a Fremen, and becomes something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani becomes his lover (but not his wife, as will become significant later) and bears him a son, whom he calls Leto. He and his mother train the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who seek out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experience victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grow.

In order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he must become a [[sandrider]]. The Fremen have a great secret: they have learned to control the giant [[sandworm]]s native to [[Arrakis]]. Through the use of "maker hooks", they have learned to climb aboard the worms and take control of their course, enabling them to quickly move around the desert. This has given the Fremen better mobility than any of the series of occupying armies of Arrakis, as air power cannot be projected in the face of common coriolis storms. Obviously riding a giant sandworm is not the safest of tasks, but Paul attempts it and succeeds, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr spring a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognises his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and calls on him and his men to surrender. Gurney is overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrenders his men, and joins Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, are some Imperial spies who attempt to kill Muad'dib. They are unsuccessful, and they are captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gives secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lives on Arrakis. Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul uses the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he has become a wormrider many of his followers have expected Muad'dib to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul breaks tradition and in doing so forces Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus taking power without killing his friend.

They return to Sietch Tabr. Gurney is shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believes she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul does not know. Gurney is about to kill her when Paul walks in, manages to stop him, and explains that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney is almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgives him and he is bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

Paul's power among the Fremen grows, but he is still frustrated. He is not all he could be: he cannot control his journeys into the future, and much of it is still blank to him. So he takes a truly risky step and consumes a tiny amount of a concentrated form of melange called [[spice essence]], and so attempts to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man has survived this experience, and it seems he fails also, because he sinks into a coma.

Paul neglects to tell anyone what he is doing; many people think he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believe he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, does all she can to wake him but fails, so out of desperation she calls Chani from the deep desert to help. Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realises what a mad thing Paul has done, and uses [[spice essence]] converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time has passed, and he glories in his new memories and powers — he tells his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself is currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He has proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he is the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declares that it is now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he comes to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levies of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again.

By now the Emperor is aware of who Muad'dib is. In advance of his arrival, he sends a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they manage to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but are driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

After the Emperor himself has landed, Paul launches the final attack. Using the House Atriedes' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blows a hole in the Shield Wall (a mountain/rock wall) that protects the capital of Dune, Arrakeen, from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoids contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". The Fremen attack under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorts out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The Sardaukar are unable to withstand the full force of the Fremen, caught as they are in total surprise, and the Emperor is forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loom in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatens to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they back off. In the surprise of Muad'dib's attack, Alia manages to escape, and in the process kills Baron Harkonnen, by now revealed to be hers and Paul's grandfather, having illegitimately sired Jessica.

Realizing that Muad'dib is not some mad Fremen religious leader changes the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, challenges Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Kanly is a formal feud or vendetta under the rules of the Great Convention carried on according to the strictest limitations. Paul agrees even knowing that it is possible he will die, but after a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempts treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphs.

Paul refuses to take any more nonsense. He forces the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who control space travel. He again threatens to destroy the spice if they do not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild have no choice – their limited powers of prophecy show Paul is capable of it – and they send everyone home. The Emperor abdicates and retires to Salusa Secundus. Paul marries the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]] (in name only; Chani remains his close companion and mother of his heirs, as Jessica did for Leto), and assumes control of the Empire. Irulan later writes extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought.

Paul promises the Fremen that he will turn Arrakis into a garden planet, while permitting that the deserts remain so that the sandworms (and consequently the melange) will survive; and all seems well in the real life of Paul Atreides.

==Setting==
At the time of the novel, advanced computers have long been forbidden due to an event known as the [[Butlerian Jihad]], and the ensuing commandment of the [[Orange Catholic Bible]]: "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind," with the penalty of being sentenced to death. In lieu of computer assistance, human skills have been developed to an astonishing degree:

* ''[[Mentat]]s'' through intensive training learn to enter a heightened mental state in which they can perform complex logical computations. Most of the best Mentats, and all of the popular "twisted Mentats," are trained/grown by the [[Bene Tleilax]], although Paul Atreides is not, having been trained by the Master of Assassins, [[Thufir Hawat]] as well as his own mother the Lady [[Jessica Atreides]]. Mentats are also used in lesser extent by the Bene Gesserit.
* The ''[[Spacing Guild]]'' holds a monopoly on interstellar transport. Its navigators use the spice/drug [[Spice Melange|melange]] to gain limited prescient abilities, enabling them to safely use the "fold space" technology — guiding Guild Heighliner ships safely to their destination by using a Holtzman engine, which allows instantaneous travel to anywhere in the galaxy.
* The ''[[Bene Gesserit]]'' is a secretive female society, often referred to as "witches," with mental and physical powers developed through thousands of generations of controlled gene lines and many years of physical and mental conditioning called prana-bindu training. When a Bene Gesserit acolyte becomes a full [[Reverend Mother]], by undergoing the Agony she gains her "ancestral memories" — the complete life experience of an infinite line of female ancestors (she cannot recall the memories of her male ancestors, and is terrified by the psychic space within her that the masculine memories inhabit). [[Reverend Mother|The Agony]] is caused by taking the bile of a dying sandworm, a poison that they must metabolically render benign within their bodies, or else they would fail the trial, and die from its lethal toxicity.

On the fringes of the Galaxy are the geneticist [[Tleilaxu]], who create shape shifters, reincarnated gholas, and Mentats, and [[Ix]], a planet whose history is lost in the mists of time and whose society is dominated by technology. The [[CHOAM]] corporation is the major underpinning of the Imperial economy, with shares and directorships determining each House's income and financial leverage.

The universe's entire power structure, including the financial and military power of the Imperium and the Great Houses, the Guild's control of interstellar travel, and the Bene Gesserit's special powers, are all subject to the availability of Melange. The control of Melange by a single group is a sociopolitical condition known as hydraulic despotism (utilizing control of a commodity with a single source to hold power over others).

A prominent feature of the setting is the use of evolved [http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Languages languages] and linguistic traits, just as J.R.R. Tolkien developed ancient languages and linguistic traits in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

==Themes==
The consequences of the actions of superheroes, and humanity's responses, form an overarching theme in the Dune series. In an interview with Frank Herbert published in [[Wikipedia:Omni (magazine)|''Omni'' Magazine]] in July 1980, the author said:
:"Enormous problems arise when human mistakes are made on the grand scale available to a superhero... Heroes are painful, superheroes are a catastrophe. The mistakes of superheroes involve too many of us in disaster." [http://www.dunenovels.com/news/genesis.html]
Also:
:"I had this theory that superheroes were disastrous for humans, that even if you postulated an infallible hero, the things this hero set in motion fell eventually into the hands of fallible mortals. What better way to destroy a civilization, society or a race than to set people into the wild oscillations which follow their turning over their critical judgment and decision-making faculties to a superhero?"

The emphasis on [[Wikipedia:ecology|ecological]] and [[Wikipedia:religion|religious]] ideas and the use of many cultural themes made the novel a provocative departure from previous science fiction.

Political themes in the Dune series include human beings' susceptibility to mass manipulation by political propaganda, religious dogma (e.g., ''The [[Missionaria Protectiva]]''), and sexual temptation, and the importance of self-awareness and self-mastery in resisting these types of control, as well as the study of power and control.

==References to the real world==
A From a historical perspective, many have noted similarities between the events of ''Dune'', in which a foreign-born son of an old colonial order unites disparate and warring tribes of religious desert nomads to win freedom from a decaying Imperial power, and the Arab Revolt of early 20th century Middle Eastern history, in which the British liaison officer T.E. Lawrence mobilized Arab fighters to break the power of the Ottoman Turks in the Arabian peninsula. While there are many striking parallels, one of the most trivial and bizarre may be that in the film adaptations ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984) and ''[[Wikipedia:Lawrence of Arabia|Lawrence of Arabia (1962)]]'', both characters representing the old Imperial order (Emperor Shaddam IV and the Turkish Bey, respectively), are played by the actor [[Wikipedia:Jose Ferrer|José Ferrer]]. In his interview with ''OMNI'', Herbert explicitly identified [[CHOAM]] with [[Wikipedia:OPEC|OPEC]], equating the spice ''melange'' to [[Wikipedia:Petroleum|oil]] (it should be noted that OPEC did not become notable as a political power until after the publication of the first novel). Parallels can also be drawn to the European/Asian spice trade of early modern Europe and later eras, in particular between the Spacing Guild and the [[Wikipedia:Dutch East India Company|Dutch East India Company]].

Another parallel story can be found in Basil Dearden's film ''Khartoum'' (1965), with Charlton Heston as General Gordon. The baroque, stylish and brocaded uniforms are very reminiscent of the Caladan ducal-court uniforms used in the first ''Dune'' movie. The British Empire sends out Gordon to administer Sudan and its capital Khartoum on behalf of Egypt, aware that this is virtually a suicide mission. Like Leto Atreides, General Gordon, a legendary and formidable warrior of the Empire, goes willingly to his demise. The historical basis of this film lies in the story of the Sudanese supposed [[Mahdi]], Muhammad Ahmad, an Islamic messianic figure that rose to power in the late 19th century. Paul Atreides is referred to as "Mahdi" at one point in the novel and in later novels, particularly [[Dune Messiah (novel)|Dune Messiah]]. The Mahdi's jihadist army prevails over the technologically superior British army in Sudan, just as the inspired Fremen defeat the Harkonnen forces and imperial troops.

Another connection exists between the name of house Atreides and the name of the legendary Greek house of [[Atreus]], whose members figure prominently in many Greek tragedies.

These parallels can be pushed too far. In particular, none of them has rebels dethroning the emperor, any parallel to the Bene Gesserit and its program, or to the ecological aspects of the ''Dune'' story.

Dune was written shortly after [[Wikipedia:LSD|LSD]] appeared in America as a recreational drug. The psychedelic experience of LSD can be directly related to the altered states of consciousness that the spice Melange can induce.

After its release, Dune has influenced many other SF works.
*In the Japanese anime ''[[Wikipedia:Last Exile|Last Exile]]'', the theme of nations waging war with a supposedly neutral arbiter strikes a similar parallel to the Dune series.

'''''God Emperor of Dune''''', written by [[Frank Herbert]], is the fourth novel in the original ''[[Dune]]'' series of novels. 3,500 years have passed since Paul Atreides became the messiah of the Fremen and the Emperor of the universe. His son, [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]], sees the path his father [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'dib]] saw, a future that avoided the extinction of [[human]] life.

That future, however, required the ultimate and monstrous act of selflessness of becoming a metamorphic vector between primate and worm. Leto II accepts the mantle of godhood from the [[Fremen]] and begins to transform himself into a monster of the desert, a [[sandworm]], that has dominated the ecology of [[Arrakis]] for millennia. Leto, now confident that his [[Golden Path]] — a course into the future in which humanity's survival is guaranteed — is now secure, wants an opportunity to remove himself from the Golden Path, i.e. to die.

==Etymology==
The title of the novel refers to Leto II, because he is both the Emperor of the galaxy (inheriting his father's authority) as well as a self-styled God of the Fremen, who spread their religion across the empire. [[God Emperor]] is a combined title referring to both of these roles, and he makes his home on Dune.

'''Heretics of Dune''', written by [[Frank Herbert]], is the fifth novel in the original ''[[Dune]]'' series. 1,500 years have passed since [[Leto II]]'s reign ended; humanity is set firmly on the [[Golden Path]]. By crushing the aspirations of humans for 3,500 years, Leto caused [[The Scattering]], an explosion of humanity into the unknown universe upon his death.

Now, some of those who went out into the universe are coming back into the realms of the [[Old Imperium]], bent on conquest. Only the [[Bene Gesserit]] perceive the Golden Path, and are faced with a choice: keep to their traditional role of hidden manipulators, quietly easing tensions and guiding human progress while struggling for their own survival; or embrace the Golden Path and push humanity onward into a new future where [[human]]s are free from the threat of extinction.

== Plot Summary ==
{{Wikipedia|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretics_of_Dune|title=Heretics of Dune}}
Much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the God Emperor. Sandworms have reappeared on [[Arrakis]] (now called Rakis), each containing a fragment of the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]]'s consciousness, and have renewed the flow of the all-important spice [[Spice Melange|melange]] to the galaxy. With [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]]'s death, a very complex economic system built on spice collapsed, resulting in trillions of people leaving known space in the great [[Scattering]]. 

A new civilization has risen, with three dominant powers: the [[Ix|Ixians]], whose no-ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection; the [[Bene Tleilax]], who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of [[Face Dancer|Face Dancers]]; and the [[Bene Gesserit]], a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities. However, people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers. The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres, a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men.

On Rakis, a girl called [[Sheeana Brugh|Sheeana]] has been discovered who can control the giant worms. The Bene Gesserit intends to use a Tleilaxu-provided [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]] to gain control of this sandrider, and the religious forces of humanity who they know will ultimately worship her. The Tleilaxu have altered the ghola to bring its physical reflexes up to modern standards. The Bene Gesserit leader, Mother Superior [[Alma Mavis Taraza|Taraza]], brings [[Miles Teg]] to guard the new Idaho. Taraza also sends Reverend Mother [[Darwi Odrade]] to take command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis. Odrade is a loose cannon; she does not obey normal Bene Gesserit prohibitions about love, and is also Teg's biological daughter. Bene Gesserit Imprinter [[Lucilla]] is also sent by Taraza to bind Idaho's loyalty to the Sisterhood with her sexual talents. However, Lucilla must deal with Reverend Mother [[Schwangyu]], head of the ghola project but also the leader of a faction within the Bene Gesserit who feel the gholas are a danger.

Above the planet [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] (formerly known as Giedi Prime), Taraza is captured and held hostage by the Honored Matres aboard an Ixian no-ship. The Honored Matres insist Taraza invite Teg to the ship, hoping to gain control of the ghola project. Teg manages to turn the tables on the Matres, and rescues the Mother Superior and her party. An attack is then made on Sheeana on Rakis, which is prevented by the intervention of the Bene Gesserit. Odrade starts training Sheeana as a Bene Gesserit. At about the same time an attempt is made on the life of Idaho, but Teg is able to defeat it. Teg flees with Duncan and Lucilla into the countryside. In an ancient Harkonnen no-globe, Teg proceeds to awaken Idaho's original memories, but does so before Lucilla can imprint Duncan and thus tie him to the Sisterhood. In the meantime, Taraza has sent her trusted general [[Alef Burzmali|Burzmali]] to search for Teg and his party, who finally establishes contact with Teg, his former mentor. During the operation, however, Teg and his companions are ambushed. Teg is captured while Lucilla and Duncan escape. Teg is tortured by a T-Probe, but under pressure discovers new abilities: drastically increased physical capabilities and an uncertain type of prescience, which he uses to easily escape. At the same time, Idaho is ambushed and taken hostage.

Taraza arranges a meeting with the Tleilaxu Master [[Tylwyth Waff|Waff]], who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the Honored Matres. When pressed on the issue of Idaho, he also admits that the Bene Tleilax have conditioned their own agenda into him. As the meeting draws to a close, Taraza accidentally divines that Waff is a [[Zensunni]], giving the Bene Gesserit a lever to understand their ancient competitor. She and Odrade meet Waff again on Rakis. He tries to assassinate Taraza but Odrade convinces him that the Sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the Bene Tleilax. Taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the Scattering. This agreement causes consternation among the Bene Gesserit, but Odrade realizes that Taraza's plan is to destroy Rakis. By destroying the planet, the Bene Gesserit would be dependent on the Tleilaxu for the spice, ensuring an alliance.

Lucilla arrives at a Bene Gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by a young Honored Matre named [[Murbella|Murbella,]] who has partially subdued Idaho.  After being defeated in a quick bout of personal combat, Murbella assumes that Lucilla is the Great Honored Matre, and allows Lucilla and Burzmali to watch through the window of a locked room while she completes the sexual enslavement of the ghola.   However, hidden Tleilaxu conditioning kicks in, and Duncan responds with an equal technique, one that overwhelms Murbella; the experience restores in him the entire memories from all of the hundreds of previous Idaho gholas. Stunned and exhausted, Murbella dimly realizes that the man is the ghola they had been warned to search for, and unlocks the door to the room to gain Lucilla's assistance in killing him.  But Lucilla says, "We will kill no one.  This ghola goes to Rakis."

The Honored Matres attack Rakis, killing Taraza. Odrade becomes temporary leader of the Bene Gesserit before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm. Teg also goes to a supposed safe house, only to discover the Honored Matres. He unleashes himself upon the complex, and finds that his prescient powers allow him to 'see' shielded no-ships; he captures one and locates Duncan and Lucilla. They are taken to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella. When they arrive, Teg intercepts Odrade and Sheeana and their giant worm, having seen Taraza's master plan with his new vision. He loads them all up in his no-ship, finally leading his troops out on a last suicidal defense of Rakis, designed to attract the rage of the Honored Matres. The Honored Matres attack Rakis, destroying the planet and the sandworms — except for the one the Bene Gesserit escape with. They intend to drown the worm in a mixture of water and spice, turning it into [[sandtrout]] which will turn the secret Bene Gesserit planet [[Chapterhouse]] into another Dune, but with the collective consciousness of the God Emperor diluted into just one sandworm, freeing humanity from the shadow of his prescience forever.

'''''Chapterhouse: Dune''''', written by Frank Herbert, is the sixth and final novel in the original ''[[Dune]]'' series. It is also known variously as '''''Chapterhouse Dune''''', '''''Chapter House Dune''''' and '''''Chapter House: Dune'''''.

The [[Bene Gesserit]] still find themselves questioning the [[Golden Path]] of humanity set by the [[God Emperor]]. Now they must survive the [[Honored Matres]], whose reckless conquest of the [[Old Empire]] threatens the Bene Gesserit's survival. The Sisters must reassess their timeless methods: does ultimate survival go beyond calculated manipulation? Is there greater purpose to life than consolidating power?

==Plot Summary==
The Bene Gesserit find themselves the target of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and superhuman skills of the Bene Gesserit, and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now in command of the Bene Gesserit, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade continues to develop her drastic, secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit are also terraforming the planet Chapterhouse to accommodate the all-important sandworms, whose native planet Dune had been destroyed by the Matres. Sheeana, in charge of the project, expects sandworms to appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire Bene Tleilax civilization, with Tleilaxu Master Scytale the only one of his kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity, Scytale possesses the Tleilaxu secret of ghola production, which he has reluctantly traded for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of their recently deceased military genius, Miles Teg. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest Duncan Idaho ghola, and former Honored Matre Murbella, whom they have accepted as a novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres.

Lampadas, a center for Bene Gesserit education, has been destroyed by the Honored Matres. The planet's Chancellor, Reverend Mother Lucilla, manages to escape carrying the shared-minds of millions of Reverend Mothers. Lucilla is forced to land on Gammu where she seeks refuge with an underground group of Jews. The Rabbi gives Lucilla sanctuary, but to save his people from the Matres he must deliver her to them. Before doing so, he reveals Rebecca, a "wild" Reverend Mother who has gained her Other Memory without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. Lucilla is then "betrayed", and taken before the Great Honored Matre Dama, who tries to persuade her to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. The Honored Matres are particularly interested in learning to voluntarily modify their body chemistry, a skill that atrophied among the Bene Gesserit who went out into the Scattering and evolved into the Honored Matres. From this, Lucilla deduces that the greater enemy that the Matres are fleeing from is making extensive use of biological warfare. Lucilla refuses to share this knowledge with the Matres, and Dama ultimately kills her.

Back on Chapterhouse, Odrade confronts Duncan and forces him to admit that he is a Mentat, proving that he retains the memories of his many ghola lives. Duncan also has continous visions of two mysterious beings, Daniel and Marty, and their Net. At first, they are limited to the Great Hold of the no-ship, but eventually he has them frequently in many places. He suspects them to be independent Face Dancers. Eventually, he deduces through a Mentat Projection that they are the malevolent hunters who have chased the Honored Matres back into the Old Atreides Empire (the 'Enemies of Many Faces'), and that they have found a new way to apply the ancient theories of the famed scientist Holtzman.

Murbella collapses under the pressure of Bene Gesserit training, and realizes that she wants to be Bene Gesserit. Odrade believes that the Sisterhood made a mistake in fearing emotion, and that in order to evolve, they must learn to accept emotions. Murbella survives the spice agony and becomes a Reverend Mother. Odrade confronts Sheeana, discovering that Duncan and Sheeana have been allies for some time. Sheeana does not reveal that they have been considering the option of reawakening Teg's memory through imprinting, nor does Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints him again as Bashar of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the assault on the Honored Matres. Odrade announces to the Bene Gesserit that Teg will lead an attack against the Honored Matres. She also makes clear her intention to share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana, making them candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior if she dies. Odrade meets with the Great Honored Matre while the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system, and victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In the midst of this battle, Rebecca and the Jews take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.

Dama's chief advisor Logno assassinates Dama with poison and assumes control of the Honored Matres. Too late, Odrade and Teg realize they have fallen into a trap, and the Honored Matres use a mysterious weapon to turn defeat into victory, and capture Odrade. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and is taken to the Great Honored Matre. Unable to control her anger, Logno attacks but is killed by Murbella. Awed by her physical prowess, the remaining Honored Matres are forced to accept her as their new leader. Odrade is also killed in the melee and Murbella shares with Odrade to absorb her newest memories, as they had already shared prior to the battle. 

Murbella's ascension to leadership is not accepted as victory by all the Bene Gesserit. Some flee Chapterhouse, notably Sheeana, who has a vision of her own, and arranges to have some of the new worms that have emerged in the Chapterhouse desert brought aboard the no-ship. Sheeana is joined by Duncan. The two escape in the giant no-ship, with Scytale, Teg and the Jews. Murbella recognizes their plan at the last minute, but is powerless to stop them. While the no-ship flees Chapterhouse, Daniel and Marty reappear. Daniel says that he has expected them, and attempts to trap the ship in the Net, which he mistakenly thinks Duncan cannot see. Duncan surprises him by demonstrating he does indeed see the Net, and deletes the navigational files of the no-ship in order to escape capture, rendering those onboard truly lost. Meanwhile, in a mysterious place, Marty accuses Daniel of deliberately letting them get away, which he denies, saying Duncan caught him by surprise by showing vision of the Net.

==Concluding the Dune saga==
''Chapterhouse: Dune'' ends on a cliffhanger with unanswered questions about the escaped ship, the merging of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, the role of [[Scytale]], the development of [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Idaho]] and [[Miles Teg]], what chased the Honored Matres, the role of the Jews, and the identity of the god-like characters in the book's final chapter.

[[Frank Herbert]] had planned to write a [[Dune 7|seventh and final Dune novel]], but his death in 1986 meant that the series has since remained unfinished until his son [[Frank Herbert Timeline|Brain Herbert]] found his notes and outline for the Dune 7. With [[Kevin J. Anderson|Kevin j. Anderson]] they wrote the [[Sequels of Dune|sequels of dune]].

Dune 7
{{Original}}

[[File:Dune-7-proof.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Dune 7'' disks, found by Brian Herbert.]]
'''''Dune 7''''' was the working title for [[Frank Herbert]]'s seventh ''Dune'' novel, which was to be the concluding chapter of the entire ''Dune'' series. He had hinted that he was planning to end the series; however, the work was never completed because of his untimely death in February 1986.

Hints of the direction he would have taken with ''Dune 7'' are in [[Heretics of Dune|''Heretics of Dune'']] and [[Chapterhouse: Dune|''Chapterhouse: Dune'']]; however, many unanswered questions remained. He did, however, tell author [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Spinrad Norman Spinrad] that he ''"planned to end the series with a novel that would transition to a fictional universe of democratic rule."''<ref>http://www.jacurutu.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1112</ref>

In 1997, as they were searching through Herbert's belongings, [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] discovered two 1980s floppy disks, labeled "Dune 7 Notes" and "Dune 7 Outline." Brian explained in an interview<ref>''Hunters of Dune'' Audiobook, with Scott Brick</ref> that these contained a one-and-a-half page outline of his father's thoughts on the seventh ''Dune'' novel. Brian and Kevin later completed ''Dune 7'' as [[Sequels of Dune|two separate novels]] set immediately after ''Chapterhouse: Dune''. They were released in 2006 and 2007, titled ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]],'' respectively. The books received a mixed critical response.

Great School
{{Mixed}}
A '''Great School''' was one of five of the highest learning and advanced training centers in the [[Corrino Empire]]. Each of the Great Schools had their own area of focus and expertise.

The five Great Schools were: the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood, the order of [[Mentat]]s, the [[Swordmaster]]s of [[Ginaz]], the [[Suk Doctor]] Inner School, and the [[Spacing Guild]]. Each of the schools had their own agenda in dealing with humanity, and each had their own specialty in helping humankind.

After the transfer of power to [[House Atreides]], each school continued to flourish or decline in their respective areas. Mentats, for example, were banned under [[Leto Atreides II]], but the study of medicine under Suk doctors was allowed to grow.

Space travel
{{mixed}}

[[File:51lO-PwxprL._SY445_-1.jpg|thumb]]

{{quote |There is a fifth force which shaped religious belief, but its effect is so universal and profound that it deserves to stand alone...it deserves to be written thus:  SPACE TRAVEL!|unknown|Appendix II: The Religion of Dune}}

'''Space travel''' played a major role in the evolution and expansion of [[human|humanity]] throughout the [[known universe]]. Two forms of '''space travel''' existed: ''faster than light space travel'', and ''conventional space travel''.

== Faster than light travel ==

[[File:Dune10-9.jpg|thumb|Supposed early draft for Jodorowsky´s Dune]]

For several thousand years, '''faster than light travel''' (''FTL travel'' or ''space-folding'') was conducted exclusively by the [[Spacing Guild]], using [[Spacefolder]] vessels piloted by [[Guild Navigator|Guild navigators]] that folded space-time and moved almost immeasurable distances in the blink of the eye.

This form of travel, while extremely expensive, was also not safe as one in ten ships that used space folding engine disappeared, at least during the early years of the technology's use before the advent of [[Guild Navigator|Navigators]]. It was utilized for both commercial and military purposes. Space-folding made use of two key factors:
* The folding of space-time, which was accomplished by the practical application of the [[Holtzman Effect]].
* The plotting of a safe course through folded space by a [[Guild Navigator]], who used prescient planning induced by vast amounts of the [[Spice Melange]].
Eventually, at some point between the fall of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the discovery of the [[Dar-es-Balat]] hoard, [[Ix]]ian [[navigation machine]]s broke the guild monopoly on foldspace by providing a means of safely navigating foldspace without a navigator.<ref>God Emperor of Dune</ref><ref>Heretics of Dune</ref>

== Conventional space travel ==
The old FTL conventional space travel was used mainly for travel within the confines of a star system (not for interstellar travel). However, before the discovery of the new faster-than-light travel method, it was also used for long-distance space travel. The old method was described as "outracing photons". Even after space-folding became the primary means of interstellar travel, many Imperial warships still kept their old FTL drives as an alternative to the much faster but less reliable Holtzmann engines.

A calculation for velocities obtainable with old FTL conventional space travel can be made from the book "The Butlerian Jihad" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Before the '''Battle of Earth''', the unified Armada is stated to have gathered at '''Salusa Secundus'''. This planet is stated in this wikipedia to be located in the '''Gamma Waiping''' system which is about 130.8 light-years form '''Earth''', again according to this wikipedia.  In the book "The Butlerian Jihad"  Xavier Harkonnen states that the Armada takes over a month to reach '''Earth''' while traveling at its maximum sustainable speed.  Using terrestrial time periods (days, weeks, months) for simplicity's sake, we get 1,591.4'''''c''''' for a month, 1,136.72'''''c''''' for six weeks, and 795.7'''''c''''' for two months ('''''c''''' being equal to the speed of light).

* [[Spacing Guild]]
* [[Spice Melange]]
* [[Holtzman Effect]]

==References==
<div class="references-small"><references/></div>

== Behind the Scenes ==
The connection between faster than light travel and the [[Holtzman Effect]] is not explicitly mentioned by [[Frank Herbert]]. It is a connection made in the prequel novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]].

In the ''''[[Legends of Dune]]'''' trilogy, the pair describe the time shortly before and during the discovery of space-folding. In these works the discovery of space-folding is attributed to [[Norma Cenva]], who goes on to become the first prescient folded space navigator. Prior to this, although described in 'The Machine Crusade' as "outracing the old faster than light method", vessels still took weeks or months to cross between even the closest stars.

Hadi Benotto
{{Original}}[[File:Hadibenotto.jpg|thumb]]

'''Hadi Benotto''' was an archeologist who was among the team of researchers which discovered [[Dar-es-Balat]]. A descendant of [[Siona Atreides]] and the [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola who survied the [[God-Emperor]], she was part of the Minority who could not be seen by prescient vision. She is known to have underwent some training with the [[Bene Gesserit]]. 
==Name==
Since she mentions in the acknowledgements that she has a husband, it is probable that Hadi is a woman. In the Arabic of today, Hadi (هادي) is a name used only for men, which means "leader" or "guide." Historically, names formerly being reserved for men frequently become female names also; in this case, it might be influenced by the German feminine name Heidi. The Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]]s also use a male forename, but usually add a female second name before the family name.

Harum
[[File:Harum.png|thumb]]

'''Harum''' was the dominant [[Ego-memory]] in the ''council'' of personalities developed by [[Leto Atreides II]] to manage the tumult of his inner lives. It is unclear whether by accepting the presence of Harum in his consciousness above the presence of his other ancestors, Leto became [[Abomination]]. He comments that by the judgement of the [[sisterhood]], he may have done. 

Harum is said to have been a [[king]] on ancient [[Earth]], one who established a dynasty lasting some three thousand years. He was presumably an [[Egyptian]], since Leto's style of ruling is referred as ''the pharaohs' model''. Alternatively, he may have been an ancestor of [[Hammurabi]], whose line established the First [[Babylonia]]n Dynasty of Ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. Leto explains the history of Harum to his Royal Scribe, [[Farad'n]] of [[House Corrino]], in the final chapter of "[[Children of Dune]]":
<blockquote>
"I'm a community dominated by one who was ancient and surpassingly powerful. He fathered a dynasty which endured for three thousand of our years. His name was Harum and, until his line trailed out in the congenital weaknesses and superstitions of a descendant, his subjects lived in a rhythmic sublimity. They moved unconsciously with the changes of the seasons. They bred individuals who tended to be short-lived, superstitious, and easily led by a god-king. Taken as a whole, they were a powerful people. Their survival as a species became habit."
</blockquote>Leto goes on to describe Harum as a "cruel and autocratic" man, but one whose cruelty was necessary to the long-term survival of his people. This philosophy is used by Leto in his [[Golden Path]] for humanity.

Iakin Nefud


Captain '''Iakin Nefud''' was the [[Captain of the Guard|captain]] of the [[House Harkonnen]] guard. He replaced [[Umman Kudu]] after he was killed by [[Leto Atreides I]]'s [[Poisoned tooth]] attack. He impressed Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] with his quick efficiency in responding to the attack and was promoted to fill Kudu's position. Before his promotion, he was a corporal. The Baron knew that he was a [[Semuta]] addict, and to him promotion also meant that he would never again lack for the drug. 

His ultimate fate is unknown, but it is likely that he was killed in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] or shortly after it.

Commission of Ecumenical Translators
The '''Commission of Ecumenical Translators''' or C.E.T. was a convocation that occurred on a neutral island of [[Earth|Old Earth]] (implied to be the [[Hawaiian islands]]) not long after the [[Butlerian Jihad]].

Encouraged by the [[Spacing Guild]] and the [[Bene Gesserit]], the leaders of all the religions of the known universe, every faith with more than a million followers, had a representative meet "in the common belief that there exists a Divine Essence in the universe."

At the end of seven standard years of controversy and paradox that spawned much violence and nearly led to chaos, the C.E.T. finally completed the [[Orange Catholic Bible]], the [[Liturgical Manual]] and the [[Commentaries]]. At this same time, the [[Azhar Book]] was assembled, and the [[Litany Against Fear]] was composed likely by the Bene Gesserit.

House Halleck was a [[House Major]] during the New Empire. It was supposedly established by [[Gurney Halleck]], a General of Emperor [[Paul Atreides]] who later rose to [[Siridar]] Governor of [[Caladan]] and [[Giedi Prime]] which he renamed [[Gammu]]. It is unknown what happened to House Halleck after the death of Gurney Halleck who apparently had no known legitimate heirs.

==Dune Encyclopedia==
The Halleck Family were described as a [[House Minor]], a family of Imperial Minstels and instrument makers from [[Chusuk]] and Giedi Prime. Though it is not explicitly mentioned it seems possible that the House's name derived from the [[House of Halleck Corrino]] and traced its origins back to [[Halleck I]].

Nilotic al-Ourouba
'''Nilotic al-Ourouba''' was the probable original home of the [[Zensunni]], the [[Misr]]. Nilotic al-Ourrouba is likely referring to the name of a location on [[Old Earth]], encompassing the areas of Egypt, the Nile Valley and maybe some additional areas of North Africa, and/or the Middle East.

==Behind the scenes==
"Nilotic" refers to the Nile river and "Al-Ourouba" literally translates as "the region", hence it can be translated as the "Nile region."

In Children of Dune, this is confirmed as Leto and Ghanima speak to each other in Egyptian.

Imperial Opal Palace
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

{{Expanded}}

The '''Imperial Opal Palace''', the residence of the [[Padishah Emperor]]s, is located in [[Corrinth City]], the capital city of the planet [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]] along the Imperial Boulevard: a large garden avenue lined with the statues of the previous [[House Corrino|Corrino]] Emperors.

Construction of the Palace Itself began in 1400 A.G. and lasted until 6032 A.G., during the reign of the Padishah Emperor [[Elrood Corrino VI]], who only enjoyed a year of the impressive State Rooms, Imperial Chambers, and extensive landscaped gardens before he was assassinated.

Above the entrance to the [[Great Hall]] in the [[Imperial Palace]] was the quote: "Law is the Ultimate Science."

Sandtrout
{{Original}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-02-27-18-46-44-1.png|thumb|Sandworm larval stage- Illustration for the Dune Encyclopedia by Matt Howarth]]
[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-08-11-36-46-1.png|thumb]]

'''Sandtrout''' were the larval form of [[sandworm]]s on the planet [[Arrakis]]. They were described as resembling large freshwater leeches, amorphous blobs or slugs.

== Relationship with Sandworms ==
Sandtrout existed in vast numbers in the sands of Arrakis. Many would die as part of the natural life cycle of the planet; the ones that survived would eventually grow, over a period of thousands of years, into the giant sandworms that lurked in the depths of Arrakeen sands. If squeezed, they excrete an extremely potent form of [[spice melange|spice]] which gave one an incredible energy boost. Also, children in [[Fremen]] [[sietch]]es would play games with them to entertain themselves, such as using them as gloves, or attaching them to sticks.

Sandtrout had the ability to transform a whole terraformed planet into desert by encapsulating large bodies of water, allowing the Sandworm to survive, as Sandworms cannot survive in a water-logged environment.

When [[Leto Atreides II]] looked into the many lives of his ancestors in [[Other Memory]], he came to realise that the sandtrout were introduced to Arrakis from another planet, eons prior. According to Leto, the sandtrout had proliferated to the point where existing ecosystems could no longer deal with them. Arrakis had been a wet planet, and when the sandtrout arrived, they encysted all the water, so that they could metamorphosize into the sandworm. This was consistent with the physical evidence that could be found on Arrakis, namely salt beds that had apparently once been great seas.

== Leto Atreides II ==
As part of his [[Golden Path]], Leto allowed several sandtrout to attach themselves to his body, so that he could turn himself into a giant Sandworm. The absorption of the sandtrout onto his body acted as a second skin, as well as provided him with immense speed and strength. The first sandtrout formed a glove over his hand, and the next ones linked to it by their cilia until most of his body was covered. Leto managed to live through the metamorphosis because his blood was spice-concentrated, leading the sandtrout to think it was water.

Over time, Leto's body gradually changed into that of a sandworm, a process that took 3500 years. The sandtrout transformed Leto until his metabolism and biochemistry were a hybrid of human and Sandworm. However, he also modified the trout in the process, making the resulting sandtrout tougher and more adaptable, allowing them to be settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the sandworm species. Leto also imparted some of his own DNA and [[genetic memory|genetic memories]] into the sandtrout that emerged from him when he died, and thus into the sandworms that evolved from them.

'''House Ginaz''' was a [[House|Great House]] of the [[Landsraad]] during the time of the [[Faufreluches]]. It was an ally of [[House Atreides]] during the time of Duke [[Leto Atreides I|Leto the Just]]. They were defeated in a [[War of Assassins]] by [[House Moritani]] of planet [[Grumman]].

==Swordmasters of Ginaz==
House Ginaz was renowned throughout the Imperium for its Swordmaster School. Presumably, many Great Houses would send a gifted soldier to be trained at this school. It was said that to reach the Ginaz School Tenth Level was to be a superior warrior in every way, even more adept than Imperial [[Sardaukar]].

Anyone who graduated from the Ginaz School was awarded the title '''Swordmaster of the Ginaz'''. During the time of Leto I, the Atreides maintained their own Swordmaster in the form of [[Duncan Idaho]]. Swordmasters were more than mere soldiers and often functioned as chief tacticians, military advisors, and even tutors to the Houses whom they served.

==Other Versions==

According to [[The Dune Encyclopedia]], House Ginaz was descended from a troop of traveling entertainers led by one [[Alberto Ginaztera]] which had risen to minor nobility.

In [[Prelude to Dune]], House Ginaz does not exist. The [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmasters]] are still based on planet [[Ginaz]] but are governed by a council of veterans and follow an idiosyncratic religion, the ''Ginaz-beliefs''.

[[File:Bg.png|thumb|BG symbol in CHOAM - Dune Houses Enhanced]]

The '''Bene Gesserit Order''', often shortened to simply the '''Bene Gesserit''' or '''the Sisterhood''', were an ancient and adept organisation, who privately denied they were a religious order, but who operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual mysticism, and whose training, whose symbolism, organization, and internal teaching methods were almost wholly religious. The Sisterhood consisted of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who used genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda of ascending the human race with the advent of their chosen one, the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], and later simply for the good and survival of humanity. Their objectives and actions formed a critical element in the evolution of humanity.

==History==

=== Origins ===
[[File:437a9a618a32275b092c0d649d4a5f3c91e511cfef0fcb85b71d21fa65b7292f-1.jpg|thumb]]

The origins of the Bene Gesserit were not widely known. What was clear is that the Bene Gesserit arose in the political turmoil that followed the [[Butlerian Jihad]], and quickly established themselves as an influential political force. After banding the 'sorceresses' who had existed before the Jihad  concurrent to the leaders of religions meeting to share views after the horrors of the Jihad, a move which the embryo Sisterhood encouraged<ref>''Dune'', Appendix II</ref>, they had formed and established their hierarchial structure by the time of the [[Battle of Corrin]] twenty years after the Jihad ended.<ref>[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]</ref> 

The ''other memories'' that were made available to [[Reverend Mothers]] of the Bene Gesserit provided a wealth of knowledge that reached far back into [[human]]ity's past, to the days when Humans were bound to [[Earth]]. Some physical remnants, such as a surviving painting by Van Gogh, also supported this connection and provided an anchor point to the distant past.

=== Emergence as a universal power ===
{{quote|We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.|[[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]]|Dune}}
For millennia, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood chose to exercise its power by acting in the background of imperial politics. Through their breeding program, their placement of agents in the imperial court and [[House|Great Houses]], and their provision of services. Examples being, the training of noble females, mediation in disputes, and overseers of negotiations, the Bene Gesserit carved out a significant niche in the structure of the Imperium. They were also silent partners in [[CHOAM]] along with the [[Bene Tleilax]].

This all changed when [[House Atreides]] wrested the imperial throne from [[House Corrino]]. After the reign of [[Paul Atreides]] and his son [[Leto Atreides II]], there came into existence a power vacuum. This vacuum was filled by both the Bene Gesserit and Bene Tleilax, who sought to maintain control over the remnants of the empire after humanity exploded across the universe in [[The Scattering]]. The Bene Gesserit came to believe that if they were to avoid coming under another [[The Tyrant|tyrant]], they would have to take a more active role in politics and universal events.

=== Time of the Honored Matres ===
It came to the point where the Bene Gesserit came to open conflict with both the Bene Tleilax and the [[Honored Matres]]; a bastardization of Bene Gesserit + Fish Speakers that returned from The Scattering. Indeed, the Sisterhood found themselves in a position of champion of the Old Order when the Honored Matres began attacking planets of the Old Imperium. During [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres|the war between the two Sisterhoods]], the Bene Gesserit [[Mother Superior|Reverend Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]], a descendant of Paul, realized only through the Sisterhood combining with the Matres could both organizations survive into the future. First, Odrade trained her captive [[Murbella]], a captured Matre, in the ways of the sisters. Then she and a ghola of [[Miles Teg]], set up a plan to attack the Honored Matre base on the [[Guild]]-world of [[Junction]]. As Odrade was killed in the ensuing battle, Murbella also killed the Honored Matre leader, [[Logno]]. Murbella then decided to unite both groups into the [[New Sisterhood]].

==== Sheeana escapes ====
There was immediate resistance to the concept of the merger, as [[Sheeana]], a rebel Reverend Mother, escaped from [[Chapterhouse]] in a [[No-ship]], with a hundred of her fellow sisters; taking a few sandworms with them. They escaped with Miles Teg and [[Duncan Idaho]], who had their own reasons for leaving; but Sheeana's group's intention was to set up a "pure" Gesserit outpost, far away from civilization. As the no-ship fold-spaced throughout the cosmos in an attempt to escape the [[tachyon net]] of the mysterious elderly couple, [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]], the sisters aboard the no-ship held true to their training and structure.

== Objectives ==
The primary objective of the Bene Gesserit was to attain further power and influence and help to direct humanity along a path of insight and stability. Up until the emergence of [[Leto Atreides II]], the anticipated means of reaching this goal was through the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] - ''the one who can be all places at once'', (A male Bene Gesserit "Reverend Mother Superior", a "super-being", and ultimately a Messiah-figure to serve the [[Missionaria Protectiva]]), and the ultimate objective of their age-old breeding program. The triumph of their plan was supposed to occur when the daughter of [[Leto Atreides I]] bred with [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]].

However, their plans were thrown into turmoil by [[Jessica Atreides]], when she consciously gave Leto Atreides I a son ([[Paul Atreides]]) instead of a daughter. Paul was assumed to be the Kwisatz Haderach, and, much to the dismay of the Bene Gesserit, arrived a generation too soon. Whether the order could have fully controlled the Kwisatz Haderach as they hoped remains debatable.

The Bene Gesserit’s plans are further disrupted when Paul bred with [[Chani]], the [[Fremen]] daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], stirring up rogue and unpredictable genetic traits. Their son, [[Leto Atreides II]], and his actions as the [[God-Emperor]], radically altered the long-term destiny of the Bene Gesserit. Their primary goal became the re-establishment of their power base, an intention that was severely tested by the emergence of the [[Honored Matres]].

This objective was largely met, thanks to the merger of the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, but it remained clear that their fate is still very much out of their own hands.

{{Stub}}
''Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is 'Thou shall not question!' But we question. We break that commandment as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity.''

== Basic structure ==
Women unquestionably ruled the Bene Gesserit, and while men did maintain some important roles, they were always answerable to at least one woman - the Bene Gesserit [[Mother Superior|Reverend Mother Superior]].

*'''[[Mother Superior|The Reverend Mother Superior]]''': maintained ultimate control of the entire order, and invoked almost unquestioned loyalty among the subordinate Reverend Mothers. A Reverend Mother chooses her successor prior to her death, and imparts her memories and personality to her. The inheritance of the Reverend Mother Superiors, at times, diverged among multiple Reverend Mothers, usually for strategic reasons.

*'''[[Kwisatz Mother]]''': possessed the strongest tie to the other voices, in charge of the program to breed the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]; She solely directed the breeding program.

The subordinate [[Reverend Mothers]] of the Bene Gesserit fulfilled many diverse roles, including intelligence gathering, diplomacy, and breeding to continue the objectives of the breeding program. They also pursued more menial roles, with their occupation determined by the quality of their genetic make-up.

*'''[[Reverend Mothers]]''': Have undergone the Spice Agony and survived. They fill the role of advisors, faculty, historians, geneticists. General authority of the Order for most members and the outside populace.

*'''[[Proctor Superiors]]''': In charge of a chapter house, each chapter house has a Proctor Superior.

*'''[[Truthsayer]]''': taught the ways to invoke the truth trance.

*'''[[Sister]]''': agents, concubines, potential wives.

*'''Initiate'''

== Powers and abilities ==
The Bene Gesserit schools were designed to maximize the physical and mental potential of humanity, especially females. As a result, Bene Gesserit adepts possessed abilities that could not be rivaled by anyone else in the known universe.

Physically, a Bene Gesserit could control every muscle and nerve in their body, right down to the individual fibers. They were supreme in the disciplines of [[prana]] and [[bindu]]. The results of this training were numerous abilities, including:

*'''Oral Analysis''': Upon tasting an item, a Bene Gesserit can break down the food into its ingredients, right down to its chemical composition;
*'''Internal Organic-Chemical Control''': Alteration of metabolism to render poisons harmless. This ability was used when potential Reverend Mothers took the [[Water of Life]];
*'''Prana Bindu''': Alteration of blood flow, body temperature, heart rate, and level of consciousness, for the purposes of survival in harsh environments, or escaping from bonds;
*'''Weirding Way''': Superior hand-to-hand combat abilities; martial arts. Bene Gesserit trained men and women unrivaled in their fighting abilities. Only Imperial [[Sardaukar]] and the [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] could approach the abilities of a Bene Gesserit in regards to combat techniques, attack speed, and resourcefulness. Later, in the Age of [[The Tyrant]], and even later, in the times after [[The Scattering]], new abilities were developed in humans by means of genetic breeding, ''in extremis'' situations (''see'' [[Miles Teg]], a Bene Gesserit [[Bashar]]), or designed into [[ghola]] abilities (''see'' "Heretics Of Dune" era [[Duncan Idaho]]).
*'''The Voice:''' Ability to influence people directly by giving them orders with a certain sound frequency. When a person is ordered to do something by the use of Voice it is almost impossible not to comply. A Bene Gesserit is trained to resist the Voice. The downside of it is the phenomenon of the entire population becoming immune to it if The Voice is being overly used upon a population. Mentats can especially become immune to the Voice if he understands how it works.
*'''Sensing the Truth:''' Truthsayers are trained to sense if someone is telling the truth or not, but the other Bene Gesserit can also spot if someone is holding something back. Example: When Dr.Yueh was supposed to betray the Duke Leto of the Atreides, he felt guilty and anxious about it. Jessica had conversations with him and sensed that he is holding something back. Being informed that Bene Gesserit can sense his guilt about what he was about to do he exploited/manipulated his own emotions (remembering his wife in the grasp of Baron Harkonnen) and mentioning her every time he thought Jessica was studying him and searching for more reasons why he felt so disturbed.

*'''Fertility Control:''' Bene Gesserit are able to control their own fertility. They can choose when to get pregnant and the gender of their child, in order to produce children when and where the order wishes following the Bene Gesserit breeding program.

Bene Gesserit mental abilities included supreme levels of discipline. A Bene Gesserit mind could alter its level of consciousness, for the sake of relaxation, and hyper-alertness in times of potential danger. Moreover, a Bene Gesserit trained individual could:

*'''Petit Perception''': monitor minutiae in others to detect concealed emotions, motivations, agendas, or even physical things such as concealed weapons, a false accent, surgery, or deception in general. This particular skill was useful in detecting [[face dancer]]s.

For more detail on Bene Gesserit training, see the related [[Bene Gesserit Training|article]].

== Teachings ==

== Behind the scenes ==

* Frank Herbert never commented on why he chose the name "Bene Gesserit." Outside the novels, it is a Latin phrase that means "well-behaved," as in the context of a government appointment ''quam diu se bene gesserit'', "during good behavior." [[Brian Herbert]], meanwhile, speculates that "Gesserit" is most likely a derivative of the word "[[wikipedia:Jesuit|Jesuit]]", an order of Catholic priests still active today.

Cone of Silence
{{Expanded}}

{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-02-13-43-20-1.png|thumb|Cone of silence -Dune RPG illustration]]

A '''Cone of Silence''' is a field or zone wherein the sound of the human voice was electronically distorted so that recording and amplifying devices could not reproduce it effectively or clearly. It was also referred to as a "''sound-deadening field''". The size of a "cone of silence" depended partly on the strength of the electronic impulse broadcast, but for practical purposes it was usually a small area about three to four meters in diameter.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the cone of silence was fairly obvious in an aristocratic society given to [[Wikipedia:Byzantine|Byzantine]] refinements of palace intrigue. According to the [[Oral History]], there were more than twenty cones of silence in the main [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] palace on [[Giedi Prime]], and it was in one of these that [[Mentat]] [[Piter de Vries]] and [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir]] discussed an unsuccessful assassination attempt — the famous episode of the poisoned [[kindjal]] — on [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]]. It is known that the Baron Harkonnen had once threatened an emissary of Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], Count [[Hasimir Fenring]], in a cone of silence at his palace.

Presumably, the cone of silence was also used by other [[House|Great Houses]], and was likely to have enjoyed an existence at the Imperial court in the [[House Corrino|Corrino]] [[Imperium]].

== Behind the Scenes ==
[[The Dune Encyclopedia]] outlines a possible background for the Cone of Silence. It states that originally, the cone of silence was developed by [[Ixian]] technicians in the fourth millennium, but it apparently proved to be fairly easy for non-Ixian electronic technicians to reproduce. Nevertheless, the Great Houses would apparently hire Ixian masters, likely under the supervision of the House [[Master of Assassins]], to inspect and refurbish the auditory facilities — both recorders and cones — of a residential palace.

Toure Bomoko
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

'''Toure Bomoko''' was the Chairman of the [[Commission of Ecumenical Translators|C.E.T.]]

After the publication of the [[Orange Catholic Bible|OCB]], he appeared to admit that C.E.T. had erred in trying to manipulate the props of popular religion:

"We shouldn't have tried to create new symbols; we should' ve realized we weren't supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted belief, that we weren't supposed to stir up curiosity about God. We are daily confronted by the terrifying instability of all things human, yet we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled, more conforming and oppressive. What is this shadow across the highway of Divine Command? It is a warning that institutions endure, that symbols endure when their meaning is lost, that mere is no summa of all attainable knowledge."

Bomoko's critics forced him soon afterward to flee to exile, his life dependent upon the [[Spacing Guild|Guild]]'s pledge of secrecy. He reportedly died on [[Tupile]], honored and beloved, his last words:

"Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, 'I am not the kind of person I want to be.' It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied."

Truthtrance
{{Original}}
'''Truthtrance''' was an advanced ability which allowed the user to detect and identify falsehood or deceit. Due to its nature, truthtrance was often a skill practiced by [[Reverend Mother]]'s to allow them to detect the truth; one would expect [[Truthsayer]]'s to be predisposed to the use of truthtrance.

Whilst a gift seen most often in Reverend Mothers, the gift was not explicitly reserved to this group, however, and it was known that some individuals could also be born with the innate ability to detect falsehood. The most notable was [[Paul Atreides]], whom [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] immediately discovered was blessed with the ability of truthtrance upon their brief meeting on [[Caladan]] in [[10191 AG]].

[[File:51ejsbUxz0L-1.jpg|thumb]]
The '''Suk Medical School''', also known as the '''Suk Inner School''', was a famous place of learning specializing with medicine, and devoted to finding cures for the ailments which plagued humanity and advancing man's medicinal knowledge. Widely considered superior to any other medical group, the Suk doctors were some of the best in fields ranging as far as cybernetics. 

Founded by [[Mohandas Suk]] after the [[Rossak Epidemic]] in [[88 BG/XD|88 BG,]] it was claimed that their graduates, like [[Mentat|Mentats]] or [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmasters]] of [[Ginaz]], were the best in the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Empire]]. [[Suk Doctor|Suk doctors]] were thought to have been mentally conditioned in a way that they can never take a human life. In a time rife with [[kanly]], this was a very valuable thing for a trusted doctor. They had a diamond tattoo on their foreheads as a sign of the [[Imperial Conditioning]] and a silver ring binding their long hair. 

It was never known if they trained their doctors in a single planet, but as late as the [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres]], Suk doctors were known to work with other people, notably with the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]]. Suk doctors needed not be recruited directly from their home planet or association, as Dr Wellington Yueh was serving [[House Richese]] when his services were hired by [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] and [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. They did, however, remit part of their expensive fees back to the Suk School.

The '''Desert War''', also known as the '''Harkonnen war''' or more formally as the '''Arrakis Affair''', was a major conflict  which took place primarly on the desert planet [[Arrakis]], with foundations as early as the [[10150s AG]], but officially beginning in [[10191 AG]] and ending in [[10196 AG]]. It marked the fall of the [[House Corrino|Corrinos]] from [[Corrino Empire|power]] and the rise of [[Atreides Empire|a new empire]].  

The war originated with the [[Atreides-Harkonnen feud|feud]] between the Atreides and the Harkonnens dating back to the [[Battle of Corrin]] and stemmed more directly from [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]]'s fear of the dangerous popularity of [[Duke]] [[Leto Atreides I|Leto Atreides]] in the [[Landsraad]]. It officially began as a [[War of Assassins]], but escalated into a large scale conflict. It was fought between [[House Atreides]], the [[Fremen]] people and their allies and [[House Harkonnen]], which was supported by the Imperial [[House Corrino]] and later the other [[House Major|Great Houses]].   

The war essentially ended with a decisive Atreides-Fremen victory in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]], but the Affair was not officially over until nearly three years later, when Shaddam IV was replaced by [[Paul Atreides]] as [[Padishah Emperor]].  
== History ==

=== Prelude {{C|10153-10191}} ===

==== Pardot Kynes ====
{{Quote|We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet. We must use man as a constructive ecological force—inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place— to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.|[[Pardot Kynes/XD | Pardot Kynes]] regarding the transformation of [[Arrakis]] to the [[Fremen]]|Dune (novel)}}
The Desert War had its first roots secretly planted when Padishah Emperor [[Elrood Corrino IX]] appointed the ecologist [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] as Imperial [[Planetologist]] on Arrakis in the year [[10153 AG]]. 

Kynes' opportunity to shape the planet came when he was exploring the landscape in a one-man [[groundcar]] behind the [[Shield Wall]], near the village of [[Windsack]], one hot afternoon when he stumbled onto six [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] bravos, [[Shield|shielded]] and fully armed, bullying three [[Fremen]] youths. It was a common scene, more slapstick than real, but Kynes realized that the bullies intended to kill the boys; one was down with a severed artery, two of the bravos were down, but it was still four armed men against two.

Kynes triggered his own shield, waded in and had silently had two of the Harkonnens dead with a slip-tip. He dodged a [[sword]] thrust, slit the third's throat with a neat entrisseur, and the remaining Harkonnen was felled by the two Fremen youths, as he saved the lad on the ground. The Fremen were confused; he was a known Imperial servant, but was also an ally. The inexperienced youths by two days later, took him to Windshack owing him a mortal obligation. There he talked to the Fremen about water, grass, about palmaries filled with date palms and open qanats flowing across the desert.

Kynes never saw the behind-the-scenes debate raging all around him. He knew the location of a major sietch and talked like a madman, he was a water burden for the sietch and also a servant of the Imperium. He did kill Harkonnens but anyone had; he just saved three fool youths and had seen [[crysknives]]. Eventually the [[tau]] of the sietch voiced the decision. Kynes was talking to a group that spread around him about open water, walking in the open without [[Stillsuit|stillsuits]], and portyguls, when [[Uliet]], an experienced fighter, was sent with a consecrated [[knife]] to kill him, with two watermen to get his water from the body. Kynes said "Remove yourself" to Uliet who stood before him, and went on talking about secret [[Windtrap|windtraps]], brushing past the man opening his for his ceremonial blow.

Uliet inexplicably, in a riddling gesture, perhaps motivated by Kynes' visionary words, walked three paces and deliberately fell on his own knife, thus "removing" himself. This was taken to be a sign by the Fremen that Kynes was to be listened to. Eventually, most Fremen took to Kynes' vision for Arrakis' future. Kynes returned to his Imperial post, directing the Biological Testing Station bringing Fremen as personnel, stealing tools like cutterays, used to dig underground [[Catchbasin|catchbasins]] and hidden windtraps and collect water in the basins. Kynes was hailed as an [[umma]], a prophet. Men, women and children went anywhere he ordered, and many died during their "missions". He set up small-unit experiments with regular interchange of data for a swift Tansley effect, accumulating millions of tiny information. He organized only isolated and rough run-through tests to put their difficulties into perspective.

Kynes had the Fremen collect copious amounts of data on the climate, biology and ecosystems of the planet. Through his research, [[sandtrout]] were discovered. Indeed, it was through the sandtrout that Kynes learned the relationship between the spice and [[Shai-hulud]]. After discovering how melange was created, Pardot Kynes turned his attention to planting greenery. First he began with a certain [[poverty grass]], then moved to many others. Kynes married into a Fremen sietch and had a son, [[Liet Kynes]] whom he taught (along with the other Fremen children) ecology and the "language" of Arrakis, of its landscape, climate, seasonal limits, and finally how to break through all ideas of force into the awareness of order.

However, he was killed in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] when Liet was nineteen. Liet continued his father's work, both in an official capacity as Imperial Planetologist, but also as Fremen leader, steering them as a people toward an ultimate goal, one that Pardot Kynes had envisioned would take approximately five hundred years. 

==== Great Spice War ====
<blockquote>''Main article: [[Great Spice War]]''</blockquote>
[[File:The Sardaukar Warriors (by John Schoenherr).jpg|thumb|The Great Spice War]]
In [[10175 AG]], just a year after Pardot's death on distant Arrakis, the 81st [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam Corrino IV]] declared the Great Spice War after news from his childhood friend [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Count Fenring]] that [[Amal|Project Amal]], a major project to create artifical spice he had begun on Ix, was almost complete. The purpose of the Great Spice War was to prevent any [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] [[House|Great Houses]] from resisting the use of Amal as an alternative to the [[Spice/XD|spice melange]] once it was complete. Half the captured spice was to go to the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]] and the other half would go to [[CHOAM/XD|CHOAM]] as a reward for their cooperation. 

Targets of the War included [[Zanovar]], where [[House Tagliari]] was devastated and Shaddam's half-brother [[Tyros Reffa]] killed, [[Korona]], a research moon of [[Richese/XD|Richese]] tipped off by the Harkonnens, and [[Beakkal]], where civil war ensued. The Emperor finally travelled to Arrakis to remove the last obstacle to Amal dependency. After Shaddam ordered the eradication of all life on the planet, the Spacing Guild immediately withdrew all heighliner use to the Emperor and the five heighliners vanished back into space leaving the Emperor and his men stranded.

The war had ended in disaster for the Imperial House due to both this and the fact that Amal was never completed to perfection before the [[Battle of Ix]]. After Shaddam's great humiliation at the end of the war, the [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperor]] faced possible censorship of the royal Crown at a special convocation of the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]]. After Shaddam's half-hearted, and near hypocritical defense of his actions of the previous years, his distaff cousin Duke [[Leto Atreides]] stepped in to defend his cousin, gave a spell-binding speech in defense of House Corrino. As a symbol and token of fealty to the Emperor, Leto gave the blade the Emperor had given him nineteen years earlier following his [[Trial by Forfeiture]] back to him.

==== Shaddam's trap ====
{{Quote|There it is, Piter—the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke’s headed into its jaws.|[[Vladimir Harkonnen]] admiring Shaddam's trap |Dune (novel)}}

In [[10190 AG]], Shaddam began to feel threatened by Leto, who had by this time trained a small army under [[Thufir Hawat]], [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]] well enough to rival the [[Sardaukar]]. 

Despite his deep reluctance for his actions, Shaddam decided to conspire with [[House Harkonnen]], the long time rivals of the Atreides family. Shaddam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen took to pressuring Leto into surrendering the [[fief]] of his native planet, [[Caladan]], and to take over the administration and spice mining operations of [[Arrakis]]. House Atreides took control of Arrakis in [[10191 AG]], as according to the Emperor's plan. A spy was also placed with the Atreides - Dr [[Wellington Yueh]].

When Leto accepted the fief, [[Count]] [[Hasimir Fenring/XD|Hasimir Fenring]] ceased being the planet's Imperial Regent and was instead given provisional control of the Atreides homeworld, Caladan. Though he served as Siridar-Absentia there at the behest of Shaddam, Fenring took little interest in his new backwater fief, and the people cared little for him in return.

=== War of Assassins {{C|10191}} ===
{{Quote|Knowing where the trap is—that’s the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale—a feint within a feint within a feint ... seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it.|[[Leto Atreides I]] explains the War of Assassins to [[Paul Atreides]]|Dune (novel)}}

Shortly after their arrival on Arrakis, the Duke observed that they had entered an undeclared [[War of Assassins]], but it had not yet achieved full scale.  Meanwhile, the Fremen people came to develop a relationship with the Duke through his even-handedness and generosity. Moreover, the Duke sent his [[Warmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]] as an advance ambassador, and through Duncan's abilities as a warrior the Atreides managed to ellicit the trust of the Fremen, and the Duke quickly learned that the Fremen were a powerful force with which to align his House.  

The Atreides also began to gain hints of knowledge of Liet, who had become as much of a great figure as his father, unaware that Planetologist Kynes was indeed ''Liet''. The Planetologist observed that Paul was able to fit his stillsuit the right way, leading him to join many other Fremen in believing him to be the Lisan al-Gaib who would lead them to paradise. 

==== Raid on Giedi Prime ====
{{Quote|Use some of Idaho’s men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime —there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.|[[Leto Atreides I]] regarding the upcoming raid to [[Thufir Hawat]]}}
The Duke soon ordered Thufir Hawat to coordinate a [[Raid on Giedi Prime|raid]] on [[Giedi Prime]], the Harkonnen homeworld, in order to destroy the (supposedly secret) [[Spice melange|spice]] hoards the Baron Harkonnen kept there for the purpose of resale. The raid was both daring and successful, and provided a morale boost to the homesick Atreides army, which had been uncertain about its future after the move from their ancestral home of [[Caladan]], and it served to prepare the troops for the looming war with [[House Harkonnen]], which both Hawat and the Duke were certain would come swiftly. 

It also demonstrated the quality of Atreides military intelligence. Most importantly, it struck at the very heart of House Harkonnen, and served as further example to the [[Landsraad]] of Atreides courage and audacity. Perhaps most brilliant of all however, was that, much to the Baron's ire, House Harkonnen could not exact retribution because the Emperor had deemed such spice hoarding as highly illegal during the Great Spice War.

==== Siege of Arrakeen ====
{{Quote|Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? But it was predictable the Duke’s men would run for those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.|[[Vladimir Harkonnen]] explains the strategy of the Siege|Dune (novel)}}
In March, after a supposed asssassination attempt on Leto's son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] using a [[hunter-seeker]], Dr Yueh lowered the defensive house shields and used sedative drugs to disable [[Leto]], [[Paul]], and [[Jessica]], leaving the Atreides leaderless and disorganized under the Harkonnen and Sardaukar military onslaught in the [[Siege of Arrakeen]], intended to finish the War of Assassins in a decisive victory. This attack marked the beginning of true war. 
[[File:Aftertheseiege.webp|thumb|The Siege of Arrakeen]]
It was during the siege that Thufir Hawat came to discover the true abilities of the [[Fremen]]. At one stage, Hawat and approximately twenty Atreides troops under his command were holed up in a cave while retreating from the Harkonnen and Sardaukar advance. Through a bond he had formed with a Fremen warrior, Hawat came to observe a skirmish between a dozen Sardaukar and a few Fremen where, after the dust had settled, only the Fremen remained standing. Moreover, he also saw that a [[troop carrier]] filled with approximately 300 Sardaukar soldiers was destroyed, killing all 300 soldiers, when a Fremen flying an [[ornithopter]] made a kamikaze run at the carrier. It was through these actions that the Mentat came to realise - belatedly - that the Fremen were a formidable force that could have been a powerful ally for his Duke. 

The Atreides army was indeed ultimately crushed, but a few key remnants managed to escape. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]], meanwhile, were sent into the desert to die. Because of the use of truthsayers in the Empire, the [[Baron Harkonnen]] needed to be able to say truthfully that he was not (directly) responsible for their deaths. However, this plan was foiled by arrangements made by Yueh (he hated the Baron and wished to at least save Paul and Jessica) and [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to kill their captors and escape into the desert, leaving the Harkonnens to believe that they died in a coriolis storm. 

==== Death of the Duke ====
{{Quote|There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.|the [[Princess Irulan]] in [[Introduction to a Child’s History of Muad’Dib]]|Dune (novel)}}
[[File:Letodeath.jpg|thumb|Leto shortly before his death]]
Yueh, eager for a shot at killing the baron he so deeply despised and knowing he wouldn't have the chance, planted a fake tooth in the Duke Leto's mouth. When bitten, the tooth would emit a poison that would  be fatal to both Leto, and hopefully, the Baron. When Yueh handed over Leto, the Baron killed Yueh. Leto, still paralyzed, but conscious, attempted to kill the Baron by breaking the gas capsule, but misjudged his moment, and was only successful in killing the Baron's adviser and [[Mentat]], [[Piter de Vries]].

=== Escalation of the conflict {{C|10191-10193}} ===
Following the Siege and their escape into the desert, Paul and Jessica initially met up with [[Planetologist]] [[Liet Kynes|Liet-Kynes]] and Atreides [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] Duncan Idaho, hiding in a botanical testing station abandonded long ago. However, they were not there long before the station was attacked by Sardaukar, who kill Duncan. Paul and Jessica flde to the deep desert in an ornithopter, parting ways with Dr Kynes. They let the Harkonnens think they had died from a coriolis storm.

In the deep desert, under the pressure of extreme circumstances and the increased doses of [[Spice]] that he has been ingesting simply by living on [[Arrakis]], some of Paul's powers came into fruition, and his ability to see possible futures exploded into awareness. He saw many things, a way out of his situation, and the restoration of the Atreides, if only he could make contact with the native [[Fremen]] and survive. 

After a dangerous crossing of the desert, [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] managed to meet up with a troop of [[Fremen]]. [[Paul]] and [[Jessica]] proved their worth by disarming [[Fremen]] in unarmed combat, aided by [[Bene Gesserit]] prana-bindu training – the "[[Weirding Way]]" – and the Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] gladly accepted them into his troop because he would like to add that skill to the Fremen people. Paul also met a young woman, [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet Kynes]], whom he had long seen in his dreams. During this scuffle, Paul disarmed a proud Fremen, Jamis, who took offence at this "presumptuous" youth, and challenged Paul to a fight to the death. Although at first unwilling to kill, he triumphed easily, making his name in the tribe, and also succeeding to the position of head of the household of the dead man. Stilgar gave Paul the name ''Usul'' – meaning "the strong base of a pillar" – as his private name within the troop; Paul gave himself the name "Paul Muad'dib" as his public Fremen name.

When they returned to the troop's sietch, they discovered the Fremen Reverend Mother was near death, and with the fortuitous arrival of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, they made Jessica their [[Sayyadina]]. Jessica, not realizing the consequences of what the Fremen were about to do, accepted to cement her place in the tribe. Halfway through the process she realized she has made a mistake, that she was  involved in a similar process to how the Bene Gesserit make their own Reverend Mothers who could see genetic memories, and realized that the baby in her womb, fathered by Leto before his death, would also go through the process. This had truly unfortunate consequences, because it was a Bene Gesserit teaching that any such baby would not have the strength to withstand the memories of its ancestors.

==== Hawat with the Harkonnens ====
Meanwhile, Thufir Hawat was taken prisoner and forced him into his service. This was done by introducing a poison into Hawat's blood, for which only the Harkonnens maintained the antidote. Baron Harkonnen saw this as a personal victory, because of Hawat's reputation, because Hawat had foiled many of the Baron's plans against the Atreides, and because the Baron's own Mentat, [[Piter de Vries]], had been killed by Duke Leto just before he died.

While in the service of the Harkonnens, Hawat used his considerable talents to manipulate the Harkonnens to some degree, through political manoeuvring and assassination. Hawat had attempted to create a rift between the Baron and his nephew, [[Feyd Rautha Harkonnen]], by using a captive Atreides warrior as a means to kill Feyd in the [[gladiator]] ring. While Hawat knew the plan would ultimately fail because of the unfair advantage Feyd would give himself, the warrior had almost succeeded. Instead of facing a drugged slave, Hawat arranged for Feyd to confront a trained Atreides soldier with his capacities fully intact. As a result, the Baron's game trainer was executed for putting Feyd in danger, which left the position vacant to be filled by one of Feyd's men.

For two years, Hawat remained in the service of the Harkonnens, plotting and scheming in subtle ways, ultimately hoping to seek revenge against those who killed his "beloved Duke", as well as against whom he believed to be the Ttaitor, the Lady Jessica. Moreover, Hawat took the defeat of the Atreides as a personal failure, and therefore believed that if he continued to scheme and manipulate inside the Harkonnen House, as well as exact revenge against the traitor, he may be able to redeem himself in some way. Indeed, he very nearly brought down the Harkonnens from within, playing the ambitions of the [[na-Baron]] Feyd-Rautha against his uncle. 

==== Muad'Dib ====
Back on Arrakis, by November [[10193 AG]], Paul had become something of a religious leader among the Fremen. Chani became his lover and bore him a son, whom he called Leto. He and his mother trained the Fremen of [[Sietch Tabr]] and other Fremen who sought out Paul in his religious guise, in the [[Weirding Way]], the Bene Gesserit's prana-bindu fighting techniques. Under his leadership his "Fedaykin" experienced victory after victory against the Harkonnens, and Paul's prestige and aura among the Fremen grew. However, in order to be truly accepted by the Fremen he had to become a [[sandrider]]. Paul attempted it and succeeded, becoming a full member of the sietch.

The same day, a band of smugglers sought melange too deep in the desert, and the Fremen of Sietch Tabr sprung a trap. In the middle of the battle Paul recognised his weapons teacher, [[Gurney Halleck]], and called on him and his men to surrender. Gurney was overjoyed and overwhelmed in equal measure. He surrendered his men, and joined Paul's service. Among Gurney's men, however, were some Imperial spies who attempted to kill Paul. They were unsuccessful, and they were captured by the Fedaykin. Paul gave secret orders for the spies to be allowed to escape, so that they would reveal that Paul Atreides still lived on Arrakis. 

Taking advantage of recruiting Gurney Halleck, Paul used the moment to solve his leadership problem. Since he had become a wormrider many of his followers had expected him to challenge Stilgar, his greatest friend among the Fremen, in order to take control of Sietch Tabr. But Paul broke tradition and in doing so forced Stilgar to do the same, managing to sidestep this issue by proclaiming himself the ruling Duke of Arrakis, and thus took power without killing his friend. They returned to Sietch Tabr. Gurney was shocked to discover Jessica is still alive, because he believed she was the one who betrayed the Atreides and that Paul did not know. Gurney was about to kill her when Paul walked in, managed to stop him, and explained that Yueh was the traitor. Gurney was almost broken by his nearly fatal and tragic error, but Jessica forgived him and he was bound even further into Atreides and Jessica's service.

==== Beginning of the Arrakis Revolt ====
{{Quote|And it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul-Muad’Dib lay alone in the Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell. And he lay as one dead, caught up in the revelation of the Water of Life, his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life. Thus was the prophecy made true that the Lisan al Gaib might be both dead and alive.|[[Irulan Corrino | Princess Irulan Corrino]] regarding Paul's transformation in [[Collected Legends of Arrakis]]}}
Paul's power among the Fremen grew, but he was still frustrated. He was not all he could be: he could not control his journeys into the future, and much of it was still blank to him. So he took a truly risky step and consumed a tiny amount of spice essence, and so attempted to perform the male equivalent of the Reverend Mother ceremony. Previously to this no man had survived this experience, and it seemed that he failed also, because he sank into a coma. Paul neglected to tell anyone what he is doing; many people thought he is dead, although others, primarily the Fedaykin, believed he is in a religious trance. His mother, Jessica, did all she can to wake him but failed, so out of desperation she called Chani from the deep desert to help. 

Chani, through her more personal knowledge of Paul's dreams and desires, realised what a mad thing Paul has done, and used spice essence converted by Jessica using her powers as a Reverend Mother to bring him out of his trance. For Paul no time had passed, and he gloried in his new memories and powers — he told  his mother and Chani immediately that the Emperor himself was currently orbiting the planet with many Sardaukar, ready to attack. He had proven the Bene Gesserit wrong: he was the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], appearing one generation ahead of the prediction. He declared that it was now time to destroy the Harkonnens.

Fremen attacks on the Harkonnens had already managed to almost entirely stop the flow of the spice from Arrakis. This forced the Emperor to act, and he came to Arrakis with all his Sardaukar, and also levied of all the other noble houses, to annihilate the Fremen if necessary in order to get the spice flowing again. By now the Emperor was aware of who Muad'Dib was. In advance of his arrival, he sent a large Sardaukar force into the deep desert for information. Attacking a sietch, they managed to kill Paul's son, and capture Alia – Paul's sister – but were driven off by Fremen children, old people and women.

=== Battle of Arrakeen {{C|10193}} ===
After the Emperor himself had landed in December, Paul launched the final attack. Using the House Atriedes' family atomics (nuclear weapons) that his men managed to retrieve after the Harkonnen attack, he blew a hole in the Shield Wall that protected the capital of Arrakeen from the surrounding desert and its fierce storms. By using the weapons this way, he narrowly avoided contravening the universal ban against using atomics on people, which would have required the other noble houses to retaliate with "planetary annihilation". 

The Fremen attacked under cover of a huge desert storm, riding sandworms from the desert through the hole in the Shield Wall. The great static force of the sandstorm then shorted out all of the Sarduakar's defensive shields. The first two waves of the Battle were commanded by [[Gurney Halleck]] and the third was commanded by [[Korba]]. Even the Sardaukar were unable to withstand the full force of the Atreides, the Fremen and their allies, caught as they were in total surprise, and Shaddam was forced to surrender. The combined forces of the Landsraad still loomed in orbit around the planet, but Paul threatened to destroy the Spice if any of them try to land, and they backed off. In the surprise of Muad'Dib's attack, Alia managed to escape, and in the process killed the Baron Harkonnen.

Upon discovering that he had been unknowingly working against Paul under the service of Baron Harkonnen, Thufir Hawat committed suicide. He felled himself on a poison needle hidden in his left hand meant for Paul, who offered him his own life for all of Hawat's service to House Atreides. Hawat, rather than kill the son of his beloved Duke, gave his life for the Atreides one last time. 

Realizing that Muad'Dib was not some mad Fremen religious leader changed the situation dramatically for the Emperor. [[Feyd-Rautha]], the Baron's nephew, an acclaimed gladiator, [[Duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen|challenged]] Paul to single combat; claiming rights of ''kanly'' as had been declared by Paul's father Leto. Paul agreed even knowing that it is possible he would die. The Emperor gave the blade which Duke Leto had given back to him eighteen years earlier to Feyd in a symbol of the end of his respect for the Atreides. After a difficult fight during which Feyd-Rautha attempted treachery in the form of a poisoned [[knife]] and needle, Paul eventually triumphed. 

The Emperor then ordered Count Fenring to kill Paul, but he refused as they both realised, looking into each other's eyes, that he was a failed Kwisatz Haderach.

=== Fall of House Corrino {{C|10193-10196}} ===
Paul refused to take any more nonsense. He forced the Emperor from the throne by the simple expedience of taking power from the real rulers of the Empire – the Spacing Guild – who controlled space travel. He again threatened to destroy the spice if they did not ship all the troops home. The Spacing Guild had no choice – their limited powers of prophecy showed Paul is capable of it – and they sent everyone home. 

The Emperor abdicated and retired to Salusa Secundus in 10196. Paul married the Emperor's eldest daughter, [[Irulan Corrino|Irulan]], and assumed control of the Empire. Irulan later wrote extensively on the subject of Muad'Dib, having nothing of him but knowledge of his lifestyle and patterns of thought. 

=== Aftermath {{C|Post 10196}} ===
After Shaddam's abdication, Paul procceed to send [[Muad'Dib's Jihad|a Fremen jihad]] across the Known Universe for the first twelve years of his reign. Finally in a position of power to reward his old friends, he made Stilgar Governor of Arrakis and Minister of State, and Gurney Halleck ruler of Giedi Prime, which had been run by the people of [[Caladan]] since the near-total annihilation of the Harkonnens. Gurney renamed the planet Gammu, although this name did not remain for long before it became known as Giedi Prime again. 

Meanwhile, Shaddam had by no means yet entirely accepted his fate and that of his family in exile. He began openly putting his Sardaukar through landing maneuvers, an act which would nevertheless be stopped by Irulan on Paul's orders. His youngest daughter [[Wensicia Corrino]] married the nobleman [[Dalak Fenring]], cousin of [[Hasimir Fenring]], and they had a son, [[Farad'n Corrino/XD|Farad'n Corrino]], who was intended to be Emperor when the Corrinos eventually regained the throne. After failing to kill Paul with the [[Emperor's Blade]], which Shaddam now gave away once more to the Count, Hasimir also helped Shaddam oversee the creation of a massive [[ghola]] army that the former Emperor was going to use to try to take back the Empire from [[Muad'Dib]]. Ultimately, none of this was successful and the Atreides remained on the throne long after the end of the Corrino line.

{{Organisation infobox|name=Combine Honnete Over Advancer Mercantiles|affiliation=*[[Corrino Empire]]
**[[Landsraad]]|image=CHOAM flage.svg}}

'''Combine Honnete Over Advancer Mercantiles''' ('''CHOAM''') was one of the major galactic organisations in the time of the [[Corrino Empire]] and later the [[Atreides Empire]], a gigantic monopoly encompassing all forms of commerce across the Imperium which essentially controlled all economic affairs across the cosmos, although it relied upon the [[Spacing Guild]] for transport across space due to the Guild's monopoly on faster-than-light travel. CHOAM touched almost all products the Guild will transport, from art forms to technology and of course [[Spice Melange|melange]]. Many Houses depended on CHOAM profits, and an enormous proportion of those depended on melange. Most economic ventures were conducted through CHOAM, in which the Imperial House, the Landsraad, and Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild all had a stake. 

CHOAM directorships were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the [[Landsraad]] as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters. Directorship in the CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company's coffers whatever it could under this power.[[File:Dune-Ccg-Judge-Of-The-Change-1-Jotc-2.jpg|thumb|CHOAM Contract]]

==Structure==
[[File:Dune-Ccg-Eye-Of-The-Storm-Eots-Choam-1.jpg|thumb|CHOAM director]]
[[File:51BzGrbR8ZL-1.jpg|thumb|CHOAM delegate]]
The corporation's management and board of directors were controlled by the [[Padishah Emperor]] and the [[Landsraad]] (with the Spacing Guild and the [[Bene Gesserit]] as silent partners). Because of its control of inter-planetary commerce, CHOAM was the largest single source of wealth in the Old Empire; as such, influence in CHOAM (through partisans within it and control of directorships) was the central goal of political maneuvering, both to receive dividends and also to skim off profits.

The structure of CHOAM was similar to that of a publicly-held corporation. It consisted of shareholders, and, as in a public company, major shareholders were given directorships to lead in the board of directors. In this case, however, all shareholders were nobles from the [[Landsraad]], which consisted of the Minor Houses, the Great Houses and the Imperial House. The Great Houses predictably held the directorships of the company, but the Emperor was able to give out and revoke directorships at whim.

== History ==
{{Stub}}During [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Muad'Dib's Jihad]], [[Crozeed]] spoke to [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] of CHOAM's concern for the loss of business that Paul's Jihad was causing throughout the Imperium.

Under the [[God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]], CHOAM experienced a reduction of influence and power, just as every other organization did under his reign. CHOAM survived in the regions of the [[Old Imperium]] during the [[Scattering]] and during the [[War of the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres]].

The '''Great Spice Hoard''' was a myth brought to [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] [[Leto Atreides II]] by his [[majordomo]] to amuse him. According to Leto, the story said there was a hoard of the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]], as large as a mountain, which was concealed in the depths of a distant planet before the [[First Empire]] and the [[Spacing Guild]]. The story also said that [[Paul Atreides|Paul-]][[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]] went there and lived yet beside the hoard, kept alive by it, waiting.

Golden Path
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Meeting_the_Emperor_by_Klausmasterflex.jpg|thumb|Meeting the Emperor by Klausmasterflex]]
The '''Golden Path''' ("Secher Nbiw" in an ancient language) was an expansive prescient interpretation that was only visible to the [[Kwisatz Haderach]] and the [[Bene Gesserit]]. It foretold the fluid events of the future, both great and small. More profoundly, however, it revealed an optimum path through the countless threads of cause and effect that were encountered by the human race.

==Dangers for Humanity==
Through prescience, [[Paul Atreides]] and [[Leto II]] foresaw that humanity would end if it stagnated and remained confined within the [[known universe]] and rigid class structure of the [[Imperium]]. Though the Imperium's population was many trillions, Leto II's rule proved that humanity was still confined within a space that could be controlled by a single interest. Although rarely addressed directly, it was often suggested that this lack of exploration and growth left humanity vulnerable to being endangered by a single threat, which would lead to the eventual destruction of humanity. The conflict between humanity's ''stated'' desire for peace and their ''actual'' need for volatility was the strong central theme of the entire Dune series, explored in every book after the first. God Emperor Leto II's stated goal was to "teach humanity a lesson that they will remember in their bones": that sheltered safety was tantamount to utter death, however long it would be delayed.

==Objectives==
The Golden Path entailed two main objectives:
* [[Leto's Peace]]. A restriction in spice production alongside spice stockpiling and the terraforming of Arrakis. The terraforming killed off all the worms, while the lack of spice restricted space travel. Eventually, after centuries of careful and deliberate oppression, Leto II was destined to die and release new sandtrout to begin a new worm-spice cycle. Subsequently, this caused the expansion of human domains far beyond the boundaries of the known universe, guaranteeing the preservation of humanity in the long term by inducing a massive expansion and diversification of human population, territory, and culture. This also taught humanity a lesson in thinking for themselves and not trusting charismatic leaders.
* The breeding program. An attempt to free humanity from prescient vision by introducing a gene through Leto's breeding program, first realized by Siona Atreides. This was to prevent anyone with the gene from being hunted by prescient hunter-seekers. It also had the effect of making all of those that possessed the gene free from manipulation by future tyrants and forces that could understand prescience. This would include Guild Navigators and the Bene Gesserit's creations.

==Origin==
Though the Bene Gesserit had long anticipated the existence of The Golden Path, the term was first vocalized by Paul Atreides after the defeat of [[House Harkonnen|House Harkonnen]]  and House Corrino on [[Arrakis]]. However, its inherent dilemmas were only apparent to him after he ingested the [[Water of Life]]. Even with his considerable powers, Paul struggled to determine the best path through the maze of decisions presented to him. This was possibly due to the fact that he was not the ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, having been born a generation sooner than the Bene Gesserit had planned. It was more likely, however, that Paul's difficulty with maintaining a clear oracular vision was because of his own emotions. Much like his father, Paul was forever tempted by a simpler life, far away from the intrigues and dangers of prescience, Imperial politics, and war. He was also continuously haunted by the death of his father and the manner in which his House was betrayed by so many.

==Evolution==
From the moment of their birth, Paul's children Leto and Ghanima knew of the Golden Path due to their [[Genetic memory|ancestral memories]], which allowed them access to all of their father's memories right up until the moment of their conception - including his vision of the Golden Path. However, unlike their father, the twins chose to begin it. Leto's ability to see into the threads of causality allowed him to choose to adopt his [[sandtrout]] skin and craft a future in which he became a human-[[sandworm]] hybrid, the long-lived [[God-Emperor]]. In this nigh-indestructible physical form, he would have the necessary time and power to guide the whole of humanity as a species.

At first, the Golden Path appeared to culminate in the ascent of House Atreides, [[jihad]], the spread of [[Fremen]] customs, and the terraforming of Arrakis. While Paul turned from the horror of the intrinsic suffering involved, Leto II saw his role and that this path was ultimately required for humanity's long-term survival. Leto eschewed prescience as a necessary - though ultimately tedious and lonely - curse, however, he used it, harnessing the infinite awareness of his "abomination". While this had turned his father to the desert and his Aunt Alia to madness, he struck a deal of sort with his multitudes: his sanity and access to infinite memory, contingent upon his sacrificing of self for the path.

For 3,500 years, he used totalitarian, ultimate theocratic tyranny, including breeding programs and other genetic manipulation, to enforce domestic tranquility. And, via the enforced switching of certain conventional power roles of genders, by maintaining an all-female, universal military force (Fish Speakers), deathly loyal to his apparent Godhead, amounting to significant manipulation of humanity's evolution away from traits that lead to war and tyrannical organization. Leto II himself eventually lost his own genitalia due to his transformation, but he was of course multi-gendered in memory, wisdom, and sensory-recall experience. In the design, Leto II describes men as requiring a period of maturation, away from playing at war like a game of adolescent, aggressive ego.

With his vast Fish Speaker army imposing his will throughout known humanity, Leto maintains a complete economic monopoly on the most valued currency, melange, executed by eradicating the worms' prior habitat in the terraforming process, hoarding the remaining spice, and taking control of all planetary stores of inhabited planets. As a result, he leveraged the resulting extreme inflation for total political and transport/resource control.

Altogether an intricately crafted design, he used extraordinary powers of total human genetic memory, Bene Gesserit encyclopaedic knowledge, unlimited enhanced human intelligence (pattern induction/deduction) and prescient awareness to guide and/or manipulate all known humanity on a continued path away from certain self-destruction. His final, fatal stroke would ultimately be to use his own death to take The Golden Path even further; first from the chaos of the enormous power vacuum and [[Scattering/XD|The Scattering]] following his death, then eventually via his surviving "pearls of awareness," dreaming endlessly among the newly-forming worms, waiting to be awoken again. Never wanting the truth of his manipulations to stay hidden, Leto II planned the eventual discovery of his "hidden journals," intended to detail his reasoning for future generations to comprehend over time.

The intention of the Path was always to enlighten and mature humanity beyond its worst tendencies - toward stagnation on one end and total chaos on the other. Chaos and its inherent surprises were cherished above all by Leto II, but humanity had to overcome its jingoistic propensities in order to gain from the chaos (innovation or "wildness") and learn, survive as well as harness new awareness throughout the millennia of continued revelation and diversity of the great scattering following Leto's Peace.

Importantly, another main aspect of the Golden Path is preventing Mankind from being trapped by prescient prophecy, both by removing the ability to see into the future from humanity through extended spice deprivation as well as by breeding a human strain invisible to prophets through the traits inherited from [[Siona Atreides|Siona]], who used this ability to successfully slay the prescient Leto II.

==Ramifications==
Despite the death of the two men who had enforced The Golden Path, its effects and ramifications were obviously still felt beyond the return of the [[Honored Matres]] and their eventual merger with the Bene Gesserit. Indeed, The Golden Path saw humanity explode across the universe, taking with it what it had known and returning with it knowledge and technology never before encountered in the [[Old Imperium]]. Moreover, The Golden Path saw humanity's physical attributes change, so that their reflexes, nervous responses, and physical movements were significantly faster than during the time of the [[Faufreluches]].

The effects of Leto's Fish Speaker military and the subsequent deprivation of military experience by males are unclear, but likely myriad. The Fish Speakers became apparently irrelevant between the fall of the Tyrant and the rise of awareness through Sheeana. As a lesson in unintended consequences, threats such as the Honored Matres formed in the Scattering, with ambitions. In this case, destroying and supplanting the Bene Gesserit, which lead to highly destructive conflicts.

==Future Time Strands==
The "great enemy" that threatens humanity in Leto's visions is not discussed in great detail. Frank Herbert makes vague references to visions of future-time strands seen by Paul and Leto II. In these visions, humans are fleeing machines, possibly of Ixian manufacture, designed solely to seek out and destroy human life and equipped with prescient abilities allowing them to hunt down all of humanity without fail. A future containing that fate would be the type of future that would compel a prescient Leto II to take humanity down his Golden Path -i.e. enforced tranquility- and accept his own fate of returning to the sand. Another possibility is that the great enemy was a superior alien race, originating in another galaxy, or even dimension.

The return of machines would be reminiscent of the Butlerian Jihad, the quest to terminate thinking machines. This would imply that humanity was undergoing a cycle of failures, continuously repeating history and its mistakes. Perhaps then the Golden Path was a way of breaking the cycle, by fixing humanity's mistakes by fixing the errors in humanity leading to the mistakes.

Some might say, however, that the enforced tranquility of the Tyrant's rule was building up pressure for the Golden Path, which was implemented by the Scattering. The Tyrant's rule certainly forced technological evolution, because anybody interested in escaping or ending the Tyrant's power first needed ways to nullify his prescience. This was eventually accomplished by no-globes and [[No-ship|no-ships]] in a way that paralleled the Tyrant's own breeding for humans that were biologically invisible to prescient vision.

God
{{Mixed}}[[File:Dunehebrewedition.png|thumb]]

'''God''', under various names, was a mythical entity, the Supreme Being of various [[religion]]s of the [[Known Universe]] throughout history. During the [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|Butlerian Jihad]], [[Iblis Ginjo]] commented that with humanity's expansion out into the galaxy, there were not nearly as many Gods as there used to be, just more ways to worship them. A young [[Norma Cenva/XD|Norma Cenva]] thought of the [[Golden Mean]] as a manifestation of the Earth mother '''Gaia''' or '''Master Creator God'''.

[[Erasmus]] once suggested that [[Omnius]] was a '''God of Machines'''. Years later, Omnius Prime convinced himself that he was the one true '''God of the Universe'''; according to his analyses, and the projections [[Erasmus]] had performed for him, he decided that he fit the definition, as he held ultimate knowledge and ultimate power.

The various [[Buddislam|Buddislamic]] sects orginally worshipped '''[[Buddallah]]''' as their God, but by the time the [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] [[Zensunni Wanderers|Wanderers]] had become the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] people they worshipped various '''Old Gods''', the chief of which was '''[[Shai-Hulud]].''' [[Siona Atreides]] later prayed to Shai-Hulud and the Old Gods while running for her life. Meanwhile, the Zensunni and [[Zensufi]] faiths preserved in the Great Belief of the [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Bene Tleilax]] came to simply refer to their deity by the traditional simple term "God".

By the last years of the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]], the most widespread concept of God was the ten-thousand-year-old male-female-neuter trinity accepted as Supreme Being in [[Orange Catholic Bible/XD|Orange Catholicism]]. During the days of the [[Atreides Empire]], [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] originally was known as a [[Mahdi]], but practically revered as godhead. His son [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] was known as the [[God-Emperor|God Emperor]] and seen as incarnation of Shai-Hulud.

Holtzman Effect
<br />{{Original}}


The '''Holtzman Effect''' or '''Holtzmann Effect''' was a scientific theory relating to the repellant force of subatomic particles, and is part of a branch of scientific discoveries in the area of physics to bear the root name [[Holtzman]].

Thousands of years later, [[Duncan Idaho]] realised that the mysterious entities known as [[Daniel]] and [[Marty]] had found another way to use Holtzman's ancient theories.[[File:Foldspace.jpg|thumb|Bhai Yogendra |alt=]]

The effects of this theory were felt on [[human]]ity for tens of thousands of years, and proved to be the catalyst for rapid technological developments in several areas. These include:

*'''[[Shield]]:''' The Effect allowed the creation of a shielding that repelled most methods of fast moving projectiles, but allowed slower moving objects, such as hand-held [[knives]], to pass through. This changed the nature of warfare - conventional projectile weapons became mostly useless and [[lasgun|laser weapons]] became incredibly dangerous, forcing humanity to return to the use of hand-weapons.
*'''[[Suspensors]]:''' The Effect's repellent effect allowed physical objects equipped with a Holtzman field generator to defy gravity.
*'''[[Glowglobe]]:''' Another practical use of the Holtzman Effect was the invention of the glowglobe, which produced light self-powered usually by organic batteries, and float allowed by a small Holtzman field suspensor generator.
*'''[[Space travel]]:''' Probably the most profound effect of the Holtzman Effect was its ability to fold space and time, and thus allow for instantaneous travel from one side of the universe to the other.

Axlotl Tank
[[File:9df1ab2bce62913605ee951f87b82ebe.jpg|thumb|DUNE : Axlotl tank: The secret of Tleilaxu. by NEWATLAS7 ]]{{Mixed}}
An '''Axlotl tank '''or''' Axolotl tank''' was the "tank" by which the [[Bene Tleilax]] reproduced a living human being from the cells of a cadaver, producing type of clone called a [[ghola]]. These tanks were  also used in the creation of genetically engineered assassins known as [[Face Dancers]]. The axlotl tanks were later engineered to replicate the spice [[melange]], previously only available on the desert planet [[Arrakis]] where it was created naturally as part of the life cycle of the [[sandworm]]s.

The unsuccessful Tleilaxu attempt to create artificial melange called ''[[ajidamal|amal]]'' ([[Project Amal]]) used axlotl technology; the best results were  gained by using a Bene Gesserit sister to create an axlotl tank.

The [[Bene Gesserit]] eventually suspected that the axlotl tanks were what remained of female Tleilaxu, since no Tleilaxu females had ever been seen. Moreover, the [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]], during the time of the [[Honored Matres]], told [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff]] that neither she nor any of her sisters would become an axlotl tank. This remark elicited shock from the Master, a reaction that indicated that the Bene Gesserit suspicion was true. Genetic information could be coded into those bred in axlotl tanks. As a result, the resulting organisms could be bred for certain aptitudes, skills, and reflexes.

Despite the revulsion axlotl tanks caused in many groups and cultures, by the time the Honored Matres had conquered the planets of the [[Old Imperium]], the Bene Gesserit had adopted them for the creation of gholas to further their cause. The last remaining Tleilaxu Master, [[Scytale]], was coerced into revealing the means of creating the tanks to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.

[[Uxtal]] used axlotl tanks to grow gholas of [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] and [[Paul Atreides]] for [[Khrone]]. When pressured by Hellica to make spice, Uxtal explained that only a Tleilaxu master has that knowledge and since all of the masters are dead, that knowledge has been lost.  Hellica then reveals that the Honored Matres kept Master [[Waff]]’s gholas alive hooked up to sperm milking machines, mirroring how the [[Tleilaxu]] used their women as axlotl tanks. From his cells, Uxtal grows multiple gholas of [[Waff]], with the intention of re-awakening the Master’s memories, and thus the knowledge of how to grow spice from the axlotl tanks. The gholas were altered to grow at an accelerated rate and in some way, this damaged them. When the gholas were threatened with death by [[Hellica]], only one regained his memories, while the others were murdered by [[Ingva]]. Unfortunately, his memories were fragmented, likely due to the accelerated growth alteration or the way in which he was awakened.  Although he did not have knowledge of how to grow spice, he revealed to Navigator [[Edrik]] that he knew how to grow something better; he knew how to grow the sandworms themselves.

==Behind the Scenes==
The name refers to a variety of salamander, and is from the Nahuatl words "atl" meaning water, and "xolotl" a shortening of “xoloizcuintle” or dog, therefore meaning "water dog". Both animals are tied to the Aztec psychopomp Xolotl. Axolotls have the capability to regenerate most of their body parts.

Atreides-Harkonnen feud

The '''feud''' between [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] and [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] was an ancient vendetta which began during the [[Battle of Corrin/XD|Battle of Corrin]] and ended ten thousand years later due to the annihilation of the Harkonnens on Arrakis.  

== History ==

=== Battle of Corrin ===
By the year [[88 BG/XD|88 BG]], the [[League of Nobles]] had [[Butlerian Jihad/XD|all but defeated]] the [[Thinking Machines/XD|thinking machines]] of the [[Synchronized Worlds|Synchronized Empire]] under the [[computer]] evermind, [[Omnius]], who had only one outpost on the planet of [[Corrin/XD|Corrin]]. At this time, [[Vorian Atreides]] was [[Supreme Bashar/XD|Supreme Bashar]] of the [[Army of Humanity]], the military of the League. [[Bashar/XD|Bashar]] [[Abulurd Harkonnen/XD|Abulurd Harkonnen]], who served under Vorian, was the grandson of [[Primero]] [[Xavier Harkonnen]], who had once been his closest friend. When the League, fuelled by the fanaticsm of the [[Butlerian movement|Cult of]] [[Serena Butler]], launched the [[Battle of Corrin/XD|Battle of Corrin]] to finally destroy Omnius. a space ring of orbiting cargo pods with humans in around the planet, the [[Bridge of Hrethgir]], was revealed. It was rigged with explosives to trigger as soon as the [[Vengeance Fleet|fleet]] passed it.

Bashar Harkonnen disagreed with Vorian, his commanding officer and refused to cross the Bridge, not wanting to play a role in the deaths of two million. Refusing to back down from his position, Vorian relieved him of his duties and confined him. Abulurd violated his confinement and deactivated the weapons for the entire League fleet. This, however, did not stop the League from achieving victory: it only made it more bloody.

For this, he was branded a coward: initially he was sentenced to death, but Vorian proposed that he be named a coward and banished from the League, to which [[Viceroy]] [[Faykan Butler]] agreed. He also specified that Abulurd would retain the shameful name of Harkonnen: Vorian sworn that for ever his descendants would spit upon the name Harkonnen. After that, it was impossible to restore his grandfather's memory. Abulurd was exiled to the backwater planet of [[Lankiveil/XD|Lankiveil]], where he made a family of his own and had [[Dirdos]], who founded [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] and two sons. The kids grew up with tales of the Jihad and came to hate the name of Atreides. 

=== Griffin on Arrakis ===
In [[4 BG]], Vorian himself was exiled to the desert planet Arrakis in exchange for the protection of his homeworld [[Kepler]], but was followed by [[Griffin Harkonnen]], the ambitious great-gandson of Abulurd who tracked him down after finding out he had been on Kepler from his sister [[Valya Harkonnen|Valya]]. Griffin confronteds Vor in a [[Zensunni]] [[Freemen of Dune|Freemen]] sietch deep in the [[Arrakeen]] desert.

[[Naib]] [[Sharnak]] told Griffin and Vorian they had to fight to end their blood feud. During the fight, Griffin revealed to Vorian that his wife on Kepler was dead, catching him off guard and ultimately getting him at his mercy, although he decided not to kill him out of honor, declaring the feud supposedly over and the two were placed in the desert. However, Vor was also being followed by the twins [[Hila]] and [[Andros]], two children of his father [[Agamemnon]] who had survived for years in an isolated robotic outpost. They eventually caught Vor in the desert and killed Griffin. Pursuing Vor, attempting to convert him to their beliefs in a new Time of Titans, they awere swallowed with the sand around them when a sandworm arrived. Vor sent a message of condolence to Griffin's sister, Valya who spurnned the offer and planned revenge, leading to the feud being far from over despite Griffin's intentions.

=== Initial climax ===
Feeling guilty for Griffin's death, Vorian tried to help his struggling family with a secret infusion of funds to their whaling business on [[Lankiveil]]. He then travelled to [[Caladan]] to meet his descendants with Leronica, who included [[Orry Atreides]], [[Shander Atreides]] and [[Willem Atreides|Willem Atreides,]] but soon tragedy began to befall the [[Atreides]] and Vorian realized too late that Griffin and Valya's younger sister [[Tula Harkonnen|Tula]] was visiting Harkonnen vengeance on them in the name of the feud. Vorian ultimately dueled Valya on [[Wallach IX/XD|Wallach IX]] and was believed to be dead by his Caladanian relatives, although in reality he survived and decided to once again begin a new life. His relatives, however, continued the feud, Willem Atreides founding [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] itself in Vorian's honor and in opposition to [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]], which was gaining more and more power under [[Danvis Harkonnen]].

Nine years later, Danvis and Willem were in competition to became chamberlain to the new emperor [[Javicco Corrino|Javicco]]. Working with his cousin [[Gerhard Harkonnen|Gerhard]] to frame and then murder Willem, Danvis was betrayed by Gerhard, who supplanted him as Baron. Meanwhile Willem, on his deathbed, pleaded for the feud to stop, but this was hopeless.

=== Conclusion ===
In [[10191 AG]], the Atreides fought the Harkonnens in the [[Desert War]] back on Arrakis, a conflict emerging from a Harkonnen alliance with the ruling [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino family]]. In this conflict, the feud finally ended, as [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]] was killed by [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]], along with his nephew and intended heir [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen/XD|Feyd-Rautha]] by her brother [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul]], leading to the end of the Harkonnens.

'''Count Glossu Rabban''' ([[10132 AG]] - December [[10193 AG]]), commonly known as '''Beast Rabban''' and also called '''Mudir Nahya''' (''Demon Ruler'') or '''King Cobra''' by the [[Fremen]], was the older nephew of [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], and the [[Count]] of [[Lankiveil]].

==Biography==
He inherited the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] penchant for sadism and cruelty, but not the cunning. He was best known for his tyrannical and vastly ineffective governance of [[Arrakis]] during the Harkonnen fiefdom of Arrakis, as well as during the insurgency of the [[Fremen]] led by [[Paul Atreides|Paul Muad'Dib]]. He earned the nickname "Beast" when he killed his father, [[Abulurd Harkonnen]]. The Baron planned to let Glossu rule the planet for a time through fear and terror so that when his favored brother, [[Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen|Feyd-Rautha]], took over, the new ruler would be welcomed as a hero. 

In the novel, while lacking in cunning, he did possess at least some degree of common sense and foresight, as he repeatedly insisted to the rest of the Harkonnens that they not underestimate the Fremen and do a head-count of their forces before occupying Arrakis, and also posed an insightful enough question about his uncle's subversion of [[Yueh]] that the baron himself had to give pause.

Rabban was slain and beheaded by the Fremen populace of [[Arrakeen]], whom he had brutalized for many years.

==Behind the scenes==
The fate of [[Lankiveil]] after the death of Rabban is not known.

Glossu Rabban was portrayed by the late Paul Smith in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 Dune movie]], by László Kish in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 Dune miniseries]], and by Dave Bautista in the [[Dune (2021 film)|2021 Dune movie]]. All three adaptations have him appear much earlier than in the book, in which he is introduced after the death of [[Piter de Vries]]. The first two adaptations depict Rabban as having died via decapitation, though this is not clearly stated in the novel. In the 1984 film, the Baron is informed that the Emperor had Rabban arrested while en route to his ship, and arrives to see Rabban's severed head on a platter. In the 2000 miniseries, when realizing he was not going to be spared by the Fremen, he drops his knife and screams into the air while bracing for the inevitable as the Fremen rush him to decapitate him.

'''High Priest Ziarenko Javid''' [d. [[10219 AG]]] was a [[Fremen]] follower of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|"Muad'Dib"]] [[House Atreides|Atreides]], who was the High Priest of the [[Qizarate]] following the execution of the treacherous [[Korba]]. In his later years he became the lover of his sister, [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides]].

== Biography ==
Javid was born in [[Sietch Jacurutu]] as the son of its [[Naib]], [[Namri]]. He was trained by his father to one day become one of the [[Water Stealers|water stealers]], but Javid left his father and the [[Iduali]] of Jacurutu, joining the [[Priesthood of Muad'Dib]] and rising to the [[Qizarate]], becoming High Priest in [[10210 AG]] after the execution of the previous High Priest, Korba, for his involvement in the [[Last Conspiracy Against Muad'Dib|last conspiracy]] against the Emperor. 

In the last years of her regency, the [[ego-memory]] sceptre of the deceased [[Baron]] [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] suggested that the Regent Alia take him as a lover. Soon after their relationship began, [[Ginaz Swordmasters|Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho]], a [[Mentat]]-[[ghola]] and Alia's husband, surmised the affair and this severely angered him. During the revolt of the Naibs, Duncan killed Javid publicly in [[Sietch Tabr]], both as revenge and in an attempt to force the hand of Tabr Naib [[Stilgar]]. Indeed, his death provoked Stilgar to abandon his position of neutrality between Alia and the rebel Fremen by killing Duncan in turn.
==Behind the scenes==
The 2003 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries ''[[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|Children of Dune]]'' indicates that Javid was still in league with the members of [[Sietch Jacurutu]] in his time as High Priest. He was also seen during the events of ''Dune Messiah'' as a child, helping Korba set the stoneburner.

Terminology of the Imperium
<br />

{{Or-DE,Ex}}

''This article is about the in-universe document Terminology of the Imperium. You may be looking for the [[List of Dune terminology]].''

The '''Terminology of the Imperium''' was a document on the [[Corrino Empire]] (although its information remained relevant through the era of the [[Atreides Empire]]) published sometime after the rise of [[Paul Atreides]] as [[Muad'Dib]].
$$

Carthag
{{mixed}}'''Carthag''' was the capital of the planet [[Arrakis]] under the rule of [[House Harkonnen]].

[[File:51DieFFcpkL-1.jpg|thumb|Carthag as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

It was erected upon their arrival as their headquarters when [[Spacing Guild]] manipulations had given them Arrakis as a quasi-fief to govern. The city was built northeast of the [[Shield Wall]] with the rapidity of inexhaustible human labor, with blocky buildings constructed of substandard materials for ostentatious purposes or functionality. [[Pardot Kynes]] noticed its lack of finesse, attention to detail or elegance, comparing it with a pustule on the surface of the planet. 

== Locations ==
*Guild Bank
*Harkonnen Palace
*Spice-mining Guild
*Water Peddlers Union

Upon the change of fief ordered by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]], [[House Atreides]] took control of Arrakis in 10,191AG. Under the Atreides leader, the [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto]], the capital moved to the city of [[Arrakeen]], which was approximately two hundred kilometres south west of Carthag.

Of the two cities, Carthag was larger,&nbsp;newer, and more densely populated. Duke Leto had assessed that Arrakeen would be easier to defend if attacked, and thus made it the planet's capital. Moreover, Leto had theorised that, because Carthag was more densely populated, it was likely to have a greater number of Harkonnen agents that could potentially subvert Atreides rule.

==Behind the Scenes==

Carthag took its name from the ancient Terran city of Carthage.

In the Dune video game, the palace of House Atreides is located in Carthag, while the palace of House Harkonnen is located in Arrakeen.

City of Tombs
The '''City of Tombs''' was a legendary place from [[Fremen]] mythology, which told that it was built by [[Shakir Ali]] in a garden one thousand paces square. It was called 'the end of the path which all men follow'. It supposedly contained a fine entry corridor two hundred and thirty-three paces long and one hundred paces wide all paved with marble from [[Jaipur]], where [[ar-Razzaq]] dwelt. It was told that on [[Day of Reckoning]], those who sought the city of tombs would not find it.

Kwisatz Haderach
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:Kwisatzhaderach.png|thumb]]
'''Kwisatz Haderach''' was a term used primarily by the [[Bene Gesserit]]. It was an old [[Chakobsa]] term that translated literally as ''"Shortening of the Way"''.

==History==
The Reverend Mother [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] tells [[Paul Atreides|Paul]] when she first meets him that the [[spice melange]] allowed the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother to unlock [[genetic memory]], but only that of their female ancestors. The masculine side of their ancestry represented a place in their consciousness that repelled and terrorized them. A Kwisatz Haderach would be a male Bene Gesserit who would have access to the memories of both his male and female ancestors as well as an ability to bridge space and time with prescient ability. 

The Bene Gesserit desire access to this knowledge and associated powers, driving them to initiate a long-running breeding program to produce such a being. He would be Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother]], [[Mentat]], and [[Guild Navigator]], all in one. The initial Bene Gesserit plan was to breed the daughter of [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] to a [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] male, which would produce the Kwisatz Haderach. This was to be the culmination of more than 10,000 years of careful breeding. This plan would have seen the end of the centuries-old feud between the [[House|Great Houses]] [[House Atreides|Atreides]] and [[House Harkonnen]] and placed a prescient, Bene Gesserit-controlled male on the [[Golden Lion Throne]]. However, because of her love for Duke Leto, the [[Jessica Atreides|Lady Jessica]] disobeyed her fellow Bene Gesserit and gave birth to a son instead of a daughter, to give him an heir, Paul.

It seemed fairly certain from early in Paul's life that he would in fact be the Kwisatz Haderach, since he showed an ability to see into the future. It was when he was fifteen years of age that the Bene Gesserit sent a Reverend Mother to test Paul's prescience and his training in the Bene Gesserit ways. This event appeared to be a significant catalyst for the events that would befall the universe for the next several thousand years. Paul's testing with the [[Gom Jabbar]], as well as the Sisterhood's silent complicity in his father's death, proved to instill significant negativity in Paul against the Sisterhood. As a result, when he reached young adulthood, and ascended to the Golden Lion Throne, he vowed that he would ''never'' be under the control of the Sisterhood. Because of this, the Sisterhood lost control of their breeding program, their Kwisatz Haderach, and the possibility of placing a Bene Gesserit on the throne.

===Paul Leaves the Golden Path===
Indeed, it appeared that the majority of people did not realize that to know the future is to be trapped by it. Paul could see that he would have to lead humanity onto a drastic course in order for it to escape its own annihilation. As a result, he chose to escape the [[Golden Path]] by allowing himself to be blinded, so that he could walk into the desert and not be a burden on his tribe. The mantle of the Golden Path was subsequently taken up by Leto II.

===Impact===
As Kwisatz Haderach, both Paul and his son Leto would at times experience significant grief because they knew they were trapped by their own destinies. One of the few people who understood this was in fact one of Paul's enemies. It was through the failed Tleilaxu Kwisatz Haderach 'experiment' that the [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale]] could in fact sympathize with Paul and the decisions he had to make.

When Leto II, the next Kwisatz Haderach, ascended to the throne, not only did he manage to avoid Bene Gesserit control, but he also took control of their breeding program. He then relegated them to a relatively insignificant role in the universe throughout the 3500 years of his reign.

===The Scattering===
After the [[Famine Times]] prompted by Leto II after his death, the remaining power brokers in the Old Empire either forgot about the concept of the Kwisatz, or vehemently guarded against the rise of another of the super-beings. The Bene Gesserit would go so far as to terminate the life of humans that showed aspects of enhanced abilities. But as was shown with the "wild" Atreides line, the heightened human abilities continually showed themselves.

After the [[The Scattering]], both [[Miles Teg]] and his daughter [[Darwi Odrade]], descendants of the Atreides, showed super-normal actions. Teg was able to move at lightning-fast speed and disabled his kidnappers on Gammu. Odrade had limited prescience that enabled her to know that the misguided [[Honored Matres]] and Bene Gesserit should merge to form one single organization.

But it was the [[Duncan Idaho gholas|ghola of Duncan Idaho]] which caused the most concern for all involved. The conservative branch of the Sisterhood, led by [[Schwangyu]], would go so far as to disobey the order of the [[Mother Superior]] [[Alma Mavis Taraza]], and terminate the life of a young Duncan ghola -- even as she has sworn to be his protector from the [[Tleilaxu]], who had allied themselves temporarily with the returning Honored Matres.

==Behind the scenes==
It's likely that the term was borrowed by [[Frank Herbert]] from the Kabbala. The compilation of Jewish mysticism the core of which is entitled HaZohar (The Book of Splendor) ascribed to Rabbi Shimon bar-Yohai, ascribed by Jewish people to have been written in the 1st century C.E. Modern scholars ascribe it to a sephardic Jewish author around the 13th century. The term itself is Hebrew, "K'fitzat ha-Derekh", (קְפִיצַת הַדֶּרֶךְ) literally, "The Leap of the Way," by means of which an initiate may travel some distance instantaneously, appearing to be in two or more places at once.

Jamis
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

{{Character_infobox|name=Jamis|birth=[[10159 AG]]|birthplace=[[Arrakis]]|death=May [[10191 AG]]|deathplace=[[Sietch Tabr]], [[Arrakis]]|family=*[[Harah]] (wife)

**[[Sietch Tabr]]|image=Actually_Jamis.jpg}}{{Original}}


'''Jamis''' ([[10159 AG]] - [[10191 AG]]) was a [[Fremen]] of [[Sietch Tabr]], best known as the man who was bested by [[Paul Atreides]] when he and his mother [[Jessica Atreides|Jessica]] were first given sanctuary by [[Stilgar]]. He was also known to be adept in playing the nine-stringed [[baliset]].

== Biography ==

=== Earlier life {{C|10159-10191}} ===
Jamis had a reputation for fighting ferociously. He was regarded as a good Fremen, but encumbered by the major flaw of faulty self-control. Undoubtedly, Jamis' greatest usefulness to the tribe lay in his superiority as a fighting man; as a raider he was formidable. Stilgar in his Chronicle pays tribute to Jamis' bravery and skill. Even though Stilgar once bested Jamis in a fight, Jamis did not hesitate to save Stilgar's life at [[Hole-in-the-Rock]]. Stilgar also spoke of Jamis sharing his water during the [[Siege of Two Birds]] and of his valiant sacrifice at [[Bight-of-the-Cliff]]. When a [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] patrol pinned down a troop from Sietch Tabr, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved. On the other hand, the fury that sustained him in battle also crippled him, for Stilgar had further noted: ''"There's too much violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader —too much [[ghafla]]."''

This exuberance, however, did not always work to his detriment; it won him a good Fremen woman, [[Harah]], for his wife. Jamis called out [[Geoff]], her mate, and bested him. Harah spoke fondly of Jamis. She noted that he loved their children; [[Kaleff]], Geoff's son, and [[Orlop]], their own. He made no distinction between them and accorded the same devotion to their upbringing. Presumably he taught his sons the rules of water discipline and the Fremen way of fighting.

=== Duel and death {{C|10191}} ===
Jamis was numbered among the troop sent into the desert by [[Liet Kynes|Liet Kynes']] [[distrans]] message to seek the strangers, Paul Atreides and his [[Bene Gesserit]] mother. When the troop came upon them at [[Tuono Basin]], Jamis was distrustful of the outworlders and urged Stilgar to do his tribal duty - to eliminate those not trained to live with the desert. Although he agreed with Jamis regarding Jessica, Stilgar saw value in Paul. Unfortunately Jamis never realized the breadth of that value; he attributed Paul's disarming him at the moment Jessica overpowered Stilgar to "witch-force". Burning with resentment at being bested by a mere "child," Jamis invoked the [[Amtal Rule]] once they reached the [[Cave of Ridges]]. Unconvinced by Jessica's mystical performance, he demanded the right to test her part in the legend through [[Duel between Paul Atreides and Jamis|combat with]] her champion, Paul.

Jessica and Stilgar tried both persuasion and trickery to convince him otherwise, but Jamis persisted. Although Jamis was an expert with the [[crysknife]] in either hand, he was no match for one steeped in the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and trained by the likes of [[Gurney Halleck]] and [[Duncan Idaho]]. He could have had no conception of the exquisite fineness of Paul's skill. Jamis' death bought Paul his sietch name, [[Usul]], and made him one of the [[Ichwan Bedwine]] with the manhood name of Paul-Muad'Dib. It was for Jamis that Paul 'Gave water to the dead', shedding a tear at his unnecessary death.

=== Legacy ===
Befitting a man of his standing, Jamis was given a full ritual funeral. Paul received Jamis' water, as was the custom, and inherited his [[yali]], or possessions (excluding the funeral gifts), and woman, Harah. Specifically, Paul received Jamis' [[coffee]] service and a bundle of [[Water Rings|water rings]], Stilgar's pick from the yali as his combat reward, and Paul himself chose Jamis' baliset, as it reminded him of his old teacher, [[Gurney Halleck|Gurney]]. The whole tribe rightly mourned Jamis' passing, for indeed, they all felt the loss on the unfortunate day that his temper drove him to challenge Paul Atreides. Jamis seemed to embody the best and worst of Fremen qualities: strength, superb fighting ability, desert wisdom, tribal loyalty, dedication to Fremen dreams and ideals, and closed-minded, bull-headed stubbornness.

'''''"The Songs of Muad'Dib"''''' by the [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan]] preserves for us the ''"Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain"'':

''Do you wrestle with dreams?''

''Do you contend with shadows?''

''Do you move in a kind of sleep?''

''Time has slipped away.''

''Your life is stolen.''

''You tarried with trifles,''

''Victim of your folly.''

}}'''Liet-Kynes''' ([[10156 AG]] - [[10191 AG]]), known outside of the [[Fremen]] as simply '''Dr Kynes''', was the son of [[Pardot Kynes]] and the father of [[Chani Kynes|Chani]] (who became the concubine of [[Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides]]). Liet was a prominent imperial planetologist/ecologist of [[Arrakis]], the [[Judge of the Change]], and the secret leader of the [[Fremen]] at the time [[House Atreides]] took control of Arrakis in 10191 AG.

Despite his loyalty to the Imperium, it was no secret on [[Arrakis]] that Kynes was the de-facto leader of the Fremen. Kynes would later become conflicted in his opinion of the Atreides, but found himself allying himself with them. Kynes later aided Paul and Jessica in their escape from the Sardaukar and Harkonnen troops, a feat which would cost him his life.
==Biography==
===Early life {{C|10156-10191}}===
Liet Kynes inherited his father's mantle and served as both the planetary ecologist of Dune and leader of the Fremen. He continued his father's vision of gradually terraforming the planet from a harsh desert world into a temperate world with precipitation, greenery, and open water. Compared to his father who almost entirely focused on the ecologic reformation of Dune and at times appeared to be tactless (though he was kind nonetheless), he paid more attention to the Fremen and was overall significantly more Fremen and less singleminded than Pardot.

=== Desert War {{C|10191}} ===

====Involvement with House Atreides ====
Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Kynes acted as arbiter of succession in regard to the change of [[fief]], as ordered by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]]. Kynes' role was to report to the [[Landsraad]] and the Emperor regarding the legality of the processes used by the Atreides in taking control of the planet, after [[House Harkonnen]] was ordered to leave.

Through his intelligence network, [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] quickly came to realise that, as well as maintaining official imperial duties, Kynes also possessed some authority with the [[Fremen]]. Reports indicated that Kynes had "gone native". As a result, Duke Leto attempted to show Kynes as much as possible that he was taking control of the planet in an honourable fashion. Moreover, Leto realised that if he could get Kynes on his side, it could possibly go a long way in winning over the Fremen, who had long-standing suspicion and distrust for the [[Faufreluches]] due to their lack of concern for the welfare of the native inhabitants of Arrakis.
====Loyalty and Death ====
Kynes died in the desert, over a pre-spice mass that had reached the critical point. Before dying, he had heard his father (a hallucination) repeat to him all of his teachings on ecology. Kynes' act of saving the Atreides served to illustrate a point: the Atreides, through their honourable ways, could instill fanatical loyalty in people, to the point where they would give their life for them. In the case of Liet Kynes, this is indeed what happened. Upon the return of House Harkonnen to Arrakis, Kynes was captured as an accomplice to the Atreides, the Fremen, and witness of the dishonourable ways of the Harkonnens. He was abandoned in the desert without water or a stillsuit, and ultimately killed when heat exhaustion, dehydration and delirium prevented him from escaping a massive [[spice blow]].
===Legacy {{C|Post 10191}}===
Kynes' line was continued by his daughter, Chani, who later became concubine of Paul. As a result, he was grandfather to the [[God-Emperor]], [[Leto Atreides II]], and his twin sister, [[Ghanima Atreides]]. Kynes' descendants continued the terraforming of Arrakis, until it became a lush and fertile world.
==Appearance==
Kynes was a tall, thin man with long, sandy hair, a sparse but mussed mustache and beard and under heavy brows, eyes that were fathomless blue-within-blue.

The '''Sardaukar''' were the elite military force of the [[Padishah Emperor]] who served prominently during the [[Corrino Empire]], later given to the command of [[Leto Atreides II]] by [[Farad'n Corrino]]. They were renowned and feared throughout the [[Known Universe]] for their fanatic zeal, superior fighting abilities, and sheer ruthlessness.

==Upbringing and Training and benefits ==
Members of the Sardaukar were raised from a young age in an unforgiving natural environment that saw almost half (6 out of every 13) die before the age of 11. Intense training gave them formidable swordsmanship and espionage abilities, and instilled in them a [[Religion|religious]] fervor that added to their mystique and served to make them even more loyal to the [[House Corrino|Imperial house]].

The fighting abilities of the Sardaukar were renowned throughout the [[Old Imperium]]. At the apex of their sway over the affairs of the Universe, it was said that their swordsmanship was comparable to that of [[Ginaz Tenth Level]], and their cunning abilities at in-fighting were said to match that of a [[Bene Gesserit]] adept. 
[[File:Screen-Shot-2020-09-09-at-12.36.21 sardaukar.webp|thumb|389x389px|Sardaukar soldiers on Salusa Secundus (''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]'', 2021)]]
The abilities of the Sardaukar were largely attributed to the harsh environment and brutal discipline they were exposed to on planet [[Salusa Secundus]], the Corrino [[prison planet]]. Only the [[Fremen]], raised in the fanatical warrior culture and merciless desert environment of [[Arrakis]], were capable of matching the Sardaukar. Fremen typically scorned [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] soldiers as cowardly and weak, but judged that the Sardaukar fought well, and even respected them to some degree.

During the Fremen uprising on Arrakis, the Sardaukar suffered a devastating defeat, opening the way for [[Paul Atreides|Paul Atreides']] elevation to the [[Golden Lion Throne]] and the title of [[Emperor]]. Subsequently, the Sardaukar became a marginal force, continuing to act as the standing army and guardians for the newly-deposed House Corrino, though they deliberately avoided direct conflict with the powerful Fremen forces of the [[Atreides Empire]].

==Personal Armament, Melee (short range)==

{{rewrite}}

* Flip-dart (see below)
* [[Kindjal]]
* Sardaukar [[knife]]
* Sardaukar [[sword]]
*[[Shigawire]] garrote
* [[Slip-tip]]

===Flip-dart===
This small barb-like needle delivers potent drugs or poisons, upon penetrating the skin of the intended victim. It is so named for the protective "flip-cover" used to conceal the needle, and to protect its user from inadvertent harm. Flip-darts can be concealed within ornamented finger rings, fighting girdles, wrist bracers, or weapon sheaths.  

'''''Length:''''' 0.5 centimeters

'''''Mass:''''' negligible

==Personal Armament, Ranged==
* [[Hunter-seeker]] (long range)
*[[Lasgun]] (long range)
*[[Maula pistol]] (mid-to-long range)
* Needle gun (mid-range; see below)
*[[Stunner]] (short-to-long range)
* Sardaukar throwing knife (mid-range)

===Needle gun===
This small projectile weapon resembles a wristwatch in size and form. Too small to contain more than a single envenomed dart, needle guns are easy to conceal and light to wear...and typically hidden beneath long baggy sleeves. To discharge the weapon, its user needs only point his arm toward the target and lift his hand from the missile trajectory; this triggers the reflexive firing mechanism. Needle guns are often worn in pairs.

'''''Length:''''' 3 - 5 centimeters (barrel)

'''''Mass:''''' negligible

'''''Range:''''' 1 - 10 meters

==Appearance and Fighting Style==
Sardaukar troops typically wore uniforms and helmets of grey and black with gold trimming. Some of their members wore their hair long, which was taken as a sign of arrogance by those who beheld them. They had a distinct combat style, which allowed them to be recognised easily.
[[File:Sardaukar fighting stance.jpg|thumb|352x352px|Sardaukar fighting stance (''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]'', 2021)]]
When in close-quarter, hand-to-hand combat, if they found themselves surrounded they would group into trios and adopt a triangular fighting stance with their backs to each other. They would carry weapons on their person that would be ingeniously concealed, such as [[shigawire]] in their hair or a fake toe or two inserted with small stabbing weapons. Sardaukar were also experts at covert operations, managing to conceal themselves among groups for extended periods of time before striking.

During the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] attack on planet [[Arrakis]], when it was under the control of [[House Atreides]], Sardaukar troops were provided by Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV|Shaddam IV]] to assist the Harkonnens. Even though the Sardaukar forces were disguised in Harkonnen livery, the Atreides managed to recognize the Sardaukar by their combat style and often hawk-like features.

==Fall of the Sardaukar==
The Sardaukar were a key element in maintaining the Imperial hegemony of [[House Corrino]]. By the time of Emperor [[Shaddam Corrino IV]], although still formidable, they had fallen prey to arrogance and overconfidence and the sustaining mystique of their warrior religion had been deeply undermined by cynicism. Finally the utter defeat of the Sardaukar by [[Paul Atreides]] and the [[Fremen]] on the plains of [[Arrakis]] sealed the fate of the Sardaukar.

After House Corrino's fall as the ruling power, it was allowed to maintain only one Imperial standard legion (approximately 30,000 men) on [[Salusa Secundus]]. The Sardaukar ceased to exist as a viable entity after [[Farad'n Corrino]] became the concubine of [[Ghanima Atreides]] when [[Leto II]] ascended to the [[Golden Lion Throne|Imperial Throne]] as [[God Emperor]]. During his rule, one of Leto II's many [[Duncan Idaho]] [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|gholas]] led the last of the Sardaukar in an attempted revolt.

The defeat on Arrakis, the Sardaukar's later revolt against the God Emperor, and the general decline of the Sardaukar organization all finally caused the dissolution of the Sardaukar corps. They were replaced by the female [[Fish Speakers]] who had (some) Sardaukar blood in their veins and in turn fell into decline after the [[Scattering]].

==Comparison to real life Armies==
They are most similar to the Roman [[wikipedia:Praetorian Guard|Praetorian Guard]], Ottoman [[wikipedia:Janissaries|Janissaries]], and to the [[Wikipedia:French Foreign Legion|French Foreign Legion]] whose elite soldiers have much in common with the Sardaukar such as the selection of the best (only 12,5% of Legion candidates pass), honor and fidelity to their army corps and especially because like the Sardaukar, some Legionnaires are former prisoners. They also look like the [[wikipedia:Spartan army|Spartan army]] in stereotypes because like the Sardaukar, Spartan soldiers were brought up from an early age and around the age of 18 had to kill their first person in order to become a soldier. But this was proven in recent times to be false.

Marty
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

[[File:240px-Grant_Wood_-_American_Gothic_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb]]
'''Marty''' was an entity who appeared in the visions of the final incarnation of [[Duncan Idaho]]. The character appeared as a homely elderly woman alongside her companion [[Daniel]]. Duncan knew for a [[Mentat]] Projection datum that they were strong enough to drive out [[Honored Matres]], and strongly suspected them to be the [[Ones of Many Faces]] who had forced the Matres to flee back into the [[Atreides Empire|Old Empire]]. He was also certain through a Projection that they had found another way to use [[Holtzman]]'s ancient theories. He suspected, although was not sure, that they were independent [[Face Dancer|Face Dancers]].

When Duncan Idaho fled [[Chapterhouse]] on a no-ship with [[Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh]], [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[Tleilaxu Master|Master]] [[Scytale]], [[Miles Teg]], a few [[Bene Gesserit]] and a few [[Judaism|Jews]], Daniel and Marty tried to stop him, attempting to trap the ship in [[Net, the|the Net]]. However, they failed; Daniel knew he saw them but he didn't suspect he saw the Net, and was taken aback by Duncan, who deleted the navigation records of the no-ship in order to escape. 

==Behind the Scenes==
It was stated before by [[Brian Herbert]]<ref>''"BH: Well, I'll just add one more element to that, that they both loved to work in the garden. And I guess you could say that their stories were ... were the plants and flowers that they were nurturing, but ... I think that my Dad, when he created characters, he always took elements of various people and put them into it. But, that ... that could have been part of it, but I would say that would be a subconscious element to it. That's an interesting observation, I like that."'' --- '''Brian Herbert''' in an interview with Scott Brick.</ref> that the characters ''Daniel'' and ''Marty'' created by [[Frank Herbert]] could be a metaphor for how he and Beverly Herbert had been watching the events in the Dune Universe unfold. In the later ''Dune'' sequels written by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]], Marty and Daniel are revealed to be representations of ancient [[artificial intelligence]]s [[Erasmus]] and [[Omnius]]. It is unknown whether or not Frank Herbert himself actually ever intended this, given that his final novel implies them to be advanced [[Tleilaxu]] creations.

Arafel
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

'''''Arafel''''' was the 'cloud darkness of holy judgement' or 'cloud-darkness at the end of the universe', associated, by implication, with [[Kralizec]], the battle at the end of the universe. As [[Leto Atreides II]], the God Emperor, died, his last words to [[Siona Atreides]] and [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho]] were:

"Do not fear the [[Ix]]ians. They can make the machines, but they can no longer make ''arafel''. I know. I was there." 

1,500 years later, [[Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]] discovered the word ''arafel'' inscribed in stones of the ruins of [[Sietch Tabr]]. She then deduced that the [[Fremen]] day began with night and following the idea of the darkness of ''arafel'', she found the Fremen carving of the setting [[Arrakeen]] sun. From there, Odrade followed a series of clues until she found a secret chamber containing an undiscovered [[spice]] hoard of Leto II and, more importantly, a message from the Tyrant to the [[Bene Gesserit]] of her own day asking how the sisterhood would meet its end.

== Behind the scenes ==
The word ''arafel'' is [[Rabbi|Hebrew]]. In modern Hebrew ''arafel'' simply means "mist" or "fog." In the Bible however it has a more potent and evocative meaning. The normal Hebrew word for darkness is ''choshek; ''the Hebrew word for "cloud" is '''anan.'' ''Arafel'' , however, actually does mean something like "cloud-darkness" as [[Frank Herbert]] has [[Siona Atreides|Siona]] explains it in ''[[God Emperor of Dune]] . '' Perhaps most significantly, this thick darkness/cloud darkness is quite closely linked with the presence of [[God]] .

''Arafel ''occurs 16 times in the Hebrew Bible and in all but one occasion it is directly associated with descriptions of Divine habitation and Divine visitations of the Hebrew [[God]] "YHWH" (I've removed the vowels out of respect for [[Rabbi|Jewish]] tradition which does not pronounce the "Divine Name"). YHWH is said to shrouded by ''arafel'', "...the [[Lord]] has said he will dwell in thick darkness (''arafel'')" (1 Kings 8:12); "Clouds and thick darkness (''arafel'') surround him (Psalm 97:2. ) According to the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy, When YHWH appears to the Hebrew people on mount Sinai/Horeb (to affirm the covenant, and reveal the 10 commandments and the rest of the law) he does so amidst fire, thunder and lightning (Ex. 20:19), as well as "darkness, a cloud and ''arafel'' (i.e. "thick darkness")" (Deut. 4:11 NRSV). That the ''arafel ''is visually impenatrable is implied first by Moses' insistence that because the people saw no visible form of YHWH, they must be careful not to make any graven images (Deut. 5).

The connection of arafel with YHWH's theophany at Sinai and the giving of the law form a natural association with "holy judgment." However, in the Hebrew prophecies, ''arafel'', the "thick darkness"/cloud-darkness," is explicitly associated with warnings and predictions of "holy judgment", . (Deutero?) Isaiah writes, " For darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness ('''''arafel''''') the peoples; but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will appear over you" (Isa 60:2 NRS). Jeremiah warns, "Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness... while you look for light, he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness ('''''arafel''''')" (Jer 13:16 NRS). the prophets Zephaniah and Joel predict a future day of judgment called "the day of YHWH." Zephaniah 1:15 "That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness ('''''arafel''''')," (Zep 1:15 NRS). Joel words are similar to Zephaniah, "a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness ('''''arafel''''')! Like blackness spread upon the mountains a great and powerful army comes; their like has never been from of old, nor will be again after them in ages to come" (Joe 2:2 NRS).

The '''Muadh''' were members of an ancient [[Religion|religious]] sect on the planet [[Caladan/XD|Caladan]]. Led by the [[Archivar]], the Muadh revered the land, preached peace, and concerned themselves with the bounty of the harvest, as symbolized by their colors of brown for the soil and green for the thriving rice plants. Countless [[pundi rice]] farmers belonged to the introspective, untroublesome religion.

The '''Golden Elixir of Life''', also known as the '''Religion of the Golden Elixir''', was a title given to the institutionalised religion of [[Paul Atreides|Paul-Muad'Dib]] as religious and political leader of the vast majority of the [[Fremen]], which was heavily derived from Fremen religion, itself a branch of [[Zensunni]] [[Buddislam]], but also from the teachings of the [[Commission of Ecumenical Translators]] as expressed in the [[Orange Catholic Bible]].

Both [[Duncan Idaho]] and [[Leto Atreides II]] described Rhajia the movement of Infinity as expressed by Life whose movement could in fact be seen by any mortal, and similarly [[Grodon Orpar Playt III]] had called it the "'''Movement of Infinity'''", and regarded it as the final stage of the [[Order of Mentats|Mentat Order]], a breaking of the chains of servitude to practicality, while [[Gilbertus Albans]] thought it nothing more than a a death trap, for only 30% of those who entered Rhajia re-awakened, whilst the other 70% became comatose and died.  

Those who survived the state reported either no memories whatsoever or the most richly satisfying intellectual experience of their lives. Rumor had it that older Mentats near death would seek Rhajia as "The most pleasant passing" a human could be blessed with.

'''''Dune Messiah''''', written by [[Frank Herbert]], is the second novel in the Dune science fiction series. It originally appeared in ''Galaxy'' magazine in 1969, in a shorter version. A longer version was first published, in novel format, in 1970 by Berkley Publishing.

==Synopsis==
{{Quote|Once more the drama begins.|The [[Padishah Emperor | Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides | Paul]] [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides) | Muad'Dib]], on his ascension to the [[Golden Lion Throne | Lion Throne]]|Dune Messiah}}
Twelve years after the events described in ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', [[Paul Atreides]] rules as [[Emperor]] of the [[Known Universe]], following [[Muad'Dib's Jihad]] which he unleashed by accepting the role of [[Mahdi]] to the [[Fremen]]. While Paul is the most powerful Emperor ever, he is ironically powerless to stop the lethal religious excesses of the juggernaut he has created.

Although sixty billion people have perished, Paul's [[prescience|prescient]] visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity. Paul's prescience reveals to him the [[Golden Path]], a complex and perilous path for the future that would eventually save humanity from stagnation and extinction. However, Paul shies away from committing to the Golden Path, refusing to sacrifice his own mythology and humanity by tightening a brutal grip on humanity over the course of thousands of years.

The situation is further complicated by the conspiracy of powerful interests who hope to reverse the events that brought [[House Atreides]] to the throne, including the remnants of the displaced [[House Corrino]], the [[Bene Gesserit]] who have lost control of their [[Kwisatz Haderach]], the [[Spacing Guild]], who now are utterly beholden to Paul, and the [[Bene Tleilax]].

The Atreides dynasty is unstable because Paul has not produced an heir. [[Chani Kynes|Chani]], his lover and concubine, is secretly given contraceptives by the Princess [[Irulan Corrino]], Paul's wife in title only. Though Paul is aware of this scenario, he has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani's death, and he does not want to lose her. But his hopes are put into question after Chani switches to an ancient Fremen fertility diet, and subsequently conceives.

The conspiring parties, intent on ending the [[Atreides Empire]], give Paul a gift he cannot resist: [[Hayt]], a [[ghola]] of [[Duncan Idaho]], his childhood teacher and friend. The conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul's ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and his empire he has created. Furthermore, Paul's acceptance of the gift weakens Paul's support among the Fremen who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean. Additionally, the Bene Tleilax, who created the ghola, hope that it will provide them extra insight and control through espionage orders embedded into its psyche.

Further complicating the situation is the physical maturity of Paul's powerful sister, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], who finds herself irresistibly attracted to Hayt/Duncan. Alia and Hayt investigate the appearance of a female corpse near the city; Hayt realizes that the fact that no-one has been reported missing implies a Tleilaxu plot in which the woman has been replaced by a [[face dancer]]. Hayt also takes this opportunity to steal a kiss from Alia. She is outraged, but Hayt just laughs, saying he took nothing more than she offered, a fact she admits to herself privately.

Paul demands to see Mohiam, who fears she will be killed, but instead discovers Paul wants to bargain with her: Paul offers to produce a child by artificial insemination in return for the survival of Chani and her child. Mohiam, desperate to regain the Atreides genes for the Bene Gesserit breeding programme, would have to violate [[Butlerian Jihad]] taboos against the use of computers. Furthermore, she realizes no child born in this way would be a candidate for the [[Golden Lion Throne]], and that the Bene Gesserit could never admit the existence of such a child without risking their position in the Empire. She decides that she must consult with her Bene Gesserit counterparts on [[Wallach IX]].

Six weeks later Chani is seen by a medic, and discovers her pregnancy has become complicated because of the contraceptives introduced to her system. Realizing that only Irulan could be the perpetrator, Chani wishes to kill her but is prevented by Paul. She questions whether it is sensible for Paul to continue to spar with Hayt, and Paul replies that the Tleilaxu have made him better than they could know and that it may be possible to restore Hayt's memories as Duncan Idaho. Unknown to Paul, this is precisely the Tleilaxu plan; to restore Hayt's memories as Idaho, thus fulfilling a long-time technological ambition, and proving to Paul that they could clone and restore Chani to him after she dies in childbirth for a heavy price.

The daughter of [[Otheym]], one of Paul's [[Fedaykin]] commandos, asks Paul to visit her father in secret, and while Paul realizes she has been replaced by a face dancer, his prescient visions show that revealing this will lead to futures he wishes to avoid. Paul is forced to admit the face dancer after she asks to be taken into Paul's household, although he places her under guard. He then visits Otheym.

Otheym reveals evidence of a conspiracy against Muad'dib among the Fremen, some of whom are distrustful of following the Atreides, and gives Paul his Tleilaxu servant [[Bijaz]], who, like a recording machine can remember faces, names, and details. Paul accepts reluctantly, seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot. As Paul's soldiers attack the conspirators, the Tleilaxu set off a [[stone burner]] that destroys the vicinity and blinds Paul. Paul is able to continue in leadership by fixing his actions precisely in line with what his previous oracular visions showed him; by moving through his life in lockstep with his previous visions, he can see even the slightest details of the world around him. The disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted.

The unraveling of the conspiracy reveals that [[Korba]], high priest of Paul's church, is among Paul's enemies, and while Korba tries to deny this, persuading the Fremen [[Naib]]s of his innocence, Paul arrives to confront him directly and Korba is put into [[Stilgar|Stilgar's]] custody.

Hayt interrogates Bijaz, but the dwarf, secretly a [[Tleilaxu Master]], uses planted conditioning words and [[whistling language|whistled]] tunes to control the ghola, and programs Hayt to offer Paul a bargain when Chani dies: Bijaz offers Chani's return as a ghola, and the hope that Duncan Idaho might be reawakened, in return for Paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile. Unknown to Hayt, this also activates a hidden compulsion that will force him to kill Paul given the appropriate circumstances. Hayt comes across Alia, who has overdosed herself with spice in the hope of enhancing her prophetic visions. Her peril provokes fierce emotional response from Duncan and Alia realizes that Duncan loves her, a fact that the ghola admits to.

News emerges that Chani has died giving birth to two healthy children, [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]]. The twins are [[pre-born]] due to their father's prescient nature and Chani's encounter with the spice essence while pregnant. News of the birth is delivered to Paul, who foresaw Ghanima's birth, but had not had any prescient warning of Leto's possible existence. His reaction to Chani's death triggers the compulsions in Hayt's mind, and he attempts to kill Paul. But reacting against its own programming, Hayt's body remembers itself, and his [[genetic memory]] returns to his consciousness, effectively returning Duncan Idaho to life. Paul is unsurprised by this, having foreseen it.

As Paul nears a crucial decision point in time, causing his prophetic visions to fail and rendering him totally blind, he is thrust into a deadly standoff. Scytale, disguised as Otheym's daughter, holds a [[knife]] to the necks of Paul's children. He offers to revive Chani as a ghola in return for Paul's abdication. Refusal of the offer would result in the murder of Paul's new-born children. However, Paul taps into Leto's conscious perspective via their bloodline connection, and using his son's eyes, he is able to throw a [[dagger]] and kill Scytale.

With Paul's visions gone, he is now blind, and he chooses to walk into the desert in the Fremen tradition, winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children, of whom Leto II will inherit his mantle of Emperor. Paul leaves Alia as regent for his children.

At the conclusion of the novel, Duncan examines the irony that Paul and Chani's deaths enabled them to triumph against their enemies. Duncan realizes that Paul escaped deification, walking into the desert as a man, while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides line. Stilgar interrupts Duncan to suggest he should go to a distraught Alia, and Duncan goes to comfort her. Stilgar reports that he has carried out Alia's orders to execute Gaius Helen Mohiam, Edric, Korba, and "a few others." Because the key players of the conspiracy are now dead, Paul's children are left in an apparently safe situation.

Corrinth City

[[File:Corrinth.jpg|thumb|Corrinth, Major city of Kaitain, Capital of the Empire.]]
[[Image:Shaddam on Kaitain.jpg|thumb|right|Shaddam, looking out over Corrinth City, from the [[Imperial Opal Palace|Palace]] on [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]].]]
'''Corrinth City''', or '''Corrinth''', is the most lavish and glamorous capital city of the planet [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]]. It was the chief city and capital of the planet [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]], homeworld of the [[Padishah Emperor/XD|Padishah Emperors]] during the ten millennia of the rule of the [[Corrino Empire]].

The city, which was named after '''[[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]]''', was the administrative center of the entire [[Imperium/XD|Imperium]].

The fifth [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Hassik Corrino III]] himself had taxed his subjects nearly into bankruptcy in order to rebuild a governmental infrastructure. While vowing not to be outdone by the Imperial [[House Corrino/XD|House Corrino]], the members of the [[Landsraad]] had built their own monuments in the growing city. Within a generation, unremarkable Kaitain had become an awesome spectacle of the Imperial architecture, museums, and bureaucratic self-indulgence.

[[Abulurd Rabban/XD|Abulurd Rabban]] noted how the extravagant beauty of the city differs from his homeworlds of [[Giedi Prime/XD|Giedi Prime]] and [[Lankiveil/XD|Lankiveil]]; the towering government buildings like a drug-induced fantasy with soaring edifices, jeweled inlays, and polished slabs of precious stone. Colorful chime kites were tethered to the tall buildings, writhing on breezes in the perpetually blue skies. The prismatic ribbons drifted across the sky and shed rainbows on the flagstones below. Abulurd noted that Kaitain was obviously more concerned with form than substance.

During the time of the [[Ascension of House Atreides/XD|Ascension of House Atreides]], during the rule of [[Muad'Dib]]; Kaitain itself, and Corrinth, were [[Sack of Kaitain|attacked]] by '''[[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Jihadi]]''' troops and severely damaged.

[[File:Lot-dune-ccg-preconstructed-starter_1_730d8cd2b749cfaa32f36e4bbadf5fea-1.jpg|thumb|The Great Hall of the Imperial Palace as depicted in the Dune CCG]]

The '''Great Hall''' is a location of the [[Imperial Palace/DE|Imperial Palace]], and stop of the [[Grand Tour]]. Its walls were covered with mosaics with the peoples of the [[Imperium/DE|Imperium]].

Above the entrance to the Great Hall in the [[Imperial Palace]] was the quote: "Law is the Ultimate Science."

The Palace was burned during an [[Sack of Kaitain|uprising]] early in [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]]' [[Fremen Jihad]]. However its art was preserved in [[picto-disc]]s contained in the crystal [[1-F469]].

Arrakeen Palace
{{Or-DE,Ex}}

Construction at the palace at [[Arrakeen]], the single most colossal structure known in all of human history, was built during the twelve-year reign of [[Paul "Muad'Dib" Atreides|Paul Atreides]] and the Fremen Jihad. Its construction was financed by spice trade: the jihad and the demands placed on the Guild navigators, encouraged by deliberate the Imperial policy, inflated the already high value of spice so greatly that Arrakis became the wealthiest planet of the Imperium. The labor for the building of the palace was in largest part supplied by the transport to Arrakis of huge workforces from planets conquered by the jihad. Also, many whole structures from subjected planets were brought in the heighliners to become part of the palace. The most important eye-witness accounts of the interior of the Imperial Keep are those of Farok, who was entertained there with other Fremen warriors at a feast celebrating the Molitor victory, and more extensively those of R.M. [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]]. Farok was not overimpressed: 

"It was cold in all that stone despite the best Ixian space heaters… He has trees in there, you know — trees from many worlds. And somewhere deep inside, I am told, he and Chani live a nomadic life and that all within the walls of their Keep. Out to the Great Hall he comes for the public audiences. He has reception halls and formal meeting places, a whole wing for his personal guard, places for the ceremonies and an inner section for communications. There is a room far beneath his fortress, I am told, where he keeps a stunted worm surrounded by a water moat with which to poison it. There he reads the future."

The Emperor entered and left the Keep by a 'thopter landing jutting from an inner wall. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, after being first softened up in a tiny cell carved with cutterays from the veined brown rock beneath Paul's Keep, was forced to hobble a great distance to the Imperial Presence. She went along seemingly endless vaulted passages lit by triangular metaglass windows and paved with tiles figuring water creatures from exotic planets. She was impressed by the immensity of this citadel, then oppressed by it. The place reeked to her of terrifying physical power. 

"No planet, no civilization in all human history had ever before seen such man-made immensity. A dozen ancient cities could be hidden in its walls!" 

She passed oval doors with winking lights, recognizing them for Ixian handiwork: pneumatic transport orifices.

As she got nearer to the Grand Reception Hall, the passages grew larger by subtle stages — tricks of arching, graduated amplification of pillared supports, displacement of the triangular windows by larger, oblong Shapes. Finally, in the far wall of a tall antechamber loomed the double doors of the Hall. "The doorway stood at least eighty meters high, half that in width." The doors swung inward, operated by Ixian machinery, immense and silent. The interior of the Hall itself could have housed the entire citadel of any ruler in human history. 

Mohiam was impressed by the architectural subtleties of the Hall's construction even more than by its immensity. "The open sweep of the room said much about hidden structural forces balanced with nicety. Trusses and supporting beams behind these walls and the faraway domed ceiling must surpass anything ever before attempted. Everything spoke of engineering genius." 

In spite of the huge scale of the Hall, its focus- — the throne of the Emperor and the Emperor Paul himself — was not dwarfed. Paul's green throne had been cut from a single Hagar emerald, the most precious possession of a subject planet. Paul conducted Mohiam into a private chamber beyond a passage behind the throne. This was a twenty-meter cube lit by yellow glowglobes, with the deep orange hangings of a desert stilltent on the walls. Paul liked to think of his fortress, that awesome pile of plasteel, as his "sietch above the sand." Through the grillwork which vented it, Paul's sleeping chamber looked over a deep abyss to the gentle arc of a footbridge constructed of crystal-stabilized gold and platinum, decorated by fire jewels from far Cedon. The bridge led to the galleries of the inner city across a pool and fountain filled with waterflowers with blood-red petals. In another direction he could see the lower buildings of the government warren. Within Paul's view also were colossal structures showing every extravagance of architecture a demented history could produce and a rapacious hand could seize: terraces like mesas, squares as large as cities, parks, premises, bits of cultured wilderness, a postern from most ancient Baghdad, a dome dreamed in mythical Damascus, an arch from the low gravity of Atar, all creating an effect of unrivaled magnificence mixed with barbarity, in which superb artistry would abut inexplicable prodigies of dismal tastelessness. Here were orchards and groves, open plantings to rival those of fabled Lebanon, thanks to the prodigality with which Paul spent water. On an escarpment near to Paul's Keep was established a fitting companion, Alia's Temple, built during the same twelve-year anni mirabiles. It had two-thousand-meter sides and doors large enough to have admitted an entire cathedral from one of the ancient religions, designed to reduce a pilgrim's soul to motedom. Alia's Temple was itself one of the wonders of the universe. 

While it certainly would have been a prodigious feat to have built the entire palace in the twelve years it seems to have taken, it would not have been impossible, given the resources available to Paul Atreides. However, a curiously persistent, if apocryphal, tradition among the Qizarate (cited in Yiam-el-Din) holds that the great citadel was completed in very much less than twelve years: 

"And it came to pass when the time was ripe for building that Muad'Dib surveyed the battle plain where the Sardaukar legions were obliterated; and he measured the battle plain with a rule. "Here will I build my palace on the place of chaos and death," he declared. "And the name of the palace shall be Paul's Keep and it shall be a great citadel, a sietch above the sand to dwarf all other Imperial monuments. And beside it will I build Alia's Temple, and pilgrims will come from all over the universe to worship there. And I will build my city in seven weeks, according to the plan of the ancient scriptures. So will I be known to future ages as the Dune Messiah, the Mahdi, who will lead his people to Paradise." And it was done as he had said. 

The Qizarate believed that the "ancient scriptures" referred to are to be found in the O.C. Bible, Prophets LXXXIX, 24-26. Known to have been a favorite with Muad'Dib, it is the text before all others which prophesies of the Messiah. Unfortunately, like other prophetic scriptural texts, it is far from easy to interpret. It concerns the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the coming and cutting off of the Messiah. Three groups of weeks are mentioned, one of seventy, one of seven and /One of sixty-two. The Qizarate interpreted seventy weeks as the time granted to the Fremen for completing their conquest of the Sardaukar, seven weeks for the building of the palace, and sixty-two weeks for the cutting off of the Mahdi, but they do not regard the three periods of weeks as continuous. The O.C. Bible Commentaries, which suggests a substitution of years for the stated weeks, was disregarded. Rather, the Qizarate point to the significance of the seven-week period as a symbolic re-enactment of the seven days of Genesis. Supposing that we entertain this wild hypothesis, that Paul's Keep was built in only seven weeks, what does it suggest to us concerning the forces at Paul's command? There is another apocryphal tradition that should be mentioned here. It is supposed that Muad'Dib modeled his building not only on the story of Jerusalem but also on that of Solomon's Temple. A curious myth regarding the construction of Paul's Keep tells that he employed giant sandworms to bore through the rocks to lay the foundations and that what we take for the work of cutterays and even what we think to be plasmeld structures are really the production of sandworm teeth and sandworm furnaces. The superstitious Fremen believed that there was a sort of emperor among the sandworms. the Grandfather of the Desert, the oldest and largest sandworm — Shai-Hulud. Muad'Dib is supposed to have formed an alliance with this god among worms, or rather he gained an ascendancy over it, for the apocryphal Dune Gospels recast the encounter of Jesus with Shaitan in the wilderness of temptation in terms of a fantastic duel between Muad'Dib and Shai-Hulud in the deep desert. It is supposed that Muad'Dib had a particular reason for wishing to employ Shai-Hulud and his subject sandworms in the construction of his citadel, probably reflecting the obscure Bremen tradition that Solomon employed a worm called Shamir to cut the stones for his Temple. 

Many are the myths of Solomon, however, and the Azhar Book contradicts that of Shamir the Worm by tracing one concerning a shameer that was a magic pebble! The main purport of the Temple-building myth is simply that Solomon employed multitudes of djinn in its construction. Had Muad'Dib a similar command over spirits? Was it possible for him to materialize his ancestors, drawing them up from his inner being and giving them tangible form? Or rather did he call spirits from the vasty deep of space, like a galactic Glendower? Alternatively, did he have some means of fixing time, so that years of work could be performed is a few days? These questions cannot now be answered; the true powers commanded by Paul Muad'Dib are unknown to us.

It is recorded in the O.C. Bible that Solomon the Magnificent took seven years to build his Temple. It would be in accordance with the Imperial spirit of Muad'Dib that he should pointedly take only seven weeks to build an overwhelmingly greater structure. It would also be characteristic of Paul's real humility that he did not, as even the apocryphal records tell us, take only seven days.

Sheeana Brugh/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Sheeana Brugh}}
[[Image:sheeana.jpg|thumb|Sheeana & the Sandworms]]
'''Sheeana Brugh''' was a [[Fremen]] who lived approximately 1500 Standard Years after the death of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]], the [[God-Emperor]]. She came to the attention of the [[Rakian Priesthood]], the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Tlulaxa|Bene Tleilax]] because it was discovered that the [[sandworm/XD|worms]] of Rakis obeyed her.

== Early life ==
Sheeana was raised by her parents in a shanty town on the outskirts of [[Arrakeen|Keen]] on [[Arrakis|Rakis]]. When she was eight years of age her town was destroyed by a worm. Sheeana watched from a distance as her parents and fellow villagers were killed. When Sheeana approached the worm that orphaned her, she was not killed by the creature. Instead, she discovered that the worm obeyed her.

Shortly thereafter, Sheanna found herself at the city of Keen. She was led there by a worm after she climbed atop of it. Upon her arrival at Keen the Rakian Priesthood adopted the girl and obeyed her every whim.

== Involvement with the Bene Gesserit ==
[[Image:Sheeana Fremen.jpg|thumb|left|Sheeana, from the Russian cover of ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'']]
Some years later, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood took an interest in her, in order to fulfill a plan orchestrated by the Sisterhood to propagate the worms on their [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]] planet. The Bene Gesserit eventually made Sheeana a sister, although her Fremen upbringing and an early exposure to [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] sexual practices (courtesy of the [[Tlulaxa|Tleilaxu]]) made her an unpredictable element within the Sisterhood.

Bene Gesserit analysis of her DNA revealed that Sheeana was a descendant of [[Siona Atreides]] and [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]. This, according to the Sisterhood's theories, was the reason why the worms obeyed her. It was also how the Sisterhood used her to lure a worm into a [[no-ship]], just before the sterilization of the surface of Rakis by the Honored Matres. From there it made its way to Chapterhouse where it was to be re-seeded.

== Escape ==
Having grown unhappy with her involvement with the Bene Gesserit, and after striking up a friendship with the Sisterhood's [[Duncan Idaho (gholas)|Duncan Idaho ghola]], Sheeana escaped in a [[no-ship]] with Duncan, the imprisoned Tleilaxu Master [[Scytale]], Ghola Teg, The Rabbi's Party (including Rebecca), some proctor Bene Gesserits and some [[sandworm/XD|sandworms]]. Their escape occurred during the turmoil of the Bene Gesserit-Honored Matres merger, and saw them journey beyond the [[known universe]] into uncharted territory, as the Bene gesserit splinter group searched for a new home.

== On Board the ''Ithaca'' - The First Decade ==
In the first few years after Duncan Idaho folded space to escape from the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]], [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], it was soon realized that the [[no-ship]] would most likely be on a multi-year journey. Sheeana took it upon herself to restart the [[ghola]] project with the help of the [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Scytale/XD|Scytale]]. In exchange for allowing Scytale to create a ghola of himself, he allowed Sheeana full access to his [[nullentropy]] tube containg the cells of human-kinds most revered leaders.

Sheeana realized that should the ship be captured by the unknown Enemy, whose passengers did not know they were being chased by [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking machines]], the gholas could aide with strategies in the fight. The first few gholas that Sheeana created were of [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]], [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]], [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Jessica Atreides]], and [[Thufir Hawat/XD|Thufir Hawat]]. Sheeana also decided a year later to create [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]], [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Wellington Yueh]], and they were decanted, and began their growth.

Amongst the ultra-conservative [[proctor]]s that she had taken from Chapterhouse, led by [[Garimi]] and [[Stokes]]; they fought bitterly with Sheeana in creating a ghola of the first known [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], Paul.

== Second Decade on the ''Ithaca'' ==
=== As a Leader ===
When Sheeana decided and then created a ghola of Leto Atreides II, both Garimi and Stokes first tried to kill him when he was just an infant. Leto's inherent sandworm DNA momentarily re-adjusted Leto's body composition and he struck violently at both [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[proctor]]s, and gravely injured Stokes. Both were caught by Sheeana, and as punishment she put the care and welfare of Leto into Garimi's hands.

During this time on the no-ship, Sheeana made a friend of the [[Futar]]s who had been on the ship when it escaped from The [[Keep]] years earlier. The leaders of the Futars on the ship, [[Hrrm/XD|Hrrm]], befriended Sheeana, but continually demanded for the feline group to be guided by their unknown [[Handlers/XD|Handlers]]. 

When Sheeana would visit the huge kilometer-long central core of the ship, the Bene Gesserit practitioner would often commune with the sandworms being held in the vast storage area there. The giant beasts had grown to sixty feet long, and were guided by a huge leader, whom Sheeana named [[Monarch]]. Sheeana knew that eventually the sandworms in the hold would need to be released onto a planet, where they could grow and reporduce, as needed.

=== Rikka's Planet ===
As Idaho lurched the no-ship throughout the heavens, he used his latent prescient ability to pick the location that the ''Ithaca'' come into the [[Known Universe]] out of. After wandering for many years, Duncan brought the vessel above a planet completely hidden by a planet-wide [[no-field]]. Sheeana led the landing party which investigated the former Honored Matres] stronghold. The planet was completely deserted, but it's building and other infrastructure was basically intact. 

After the Sheeana activated a holo-recording in a judicial building with [[Garimi]], they learned that a Matre sub-commander named [[Rikka]] had been infected by a virulent plague, and had brought it back to her home world, and had been put on trial. Rikka desctribed in the centuries old recording how the Enemy with "many faces", in actuality the [[Thinking Machines]], had sprung the Plague, and that it would soon infect everyone on the world. The judicial body on the ancient recording still sentenced Rikka to the [[Long Death]]. The civilization had then subsequently perished. As the location was well know to the ancient enemy, Sheeana and the Gesserit sisters decided not to settle down on the world.

=== Planet of the Handlers ===

====The Futar Hunt====
As Miles Teg's latent abilities began to surface more and more, he set the ''Ithaca'' down out of fold-space at the [[Planet of the Handlers]]. The world was inhabited by [[futar]]s and unbeknownst to the ''Ithaca'' crew, [[Enhanced Face Dancer]]s—who were loyal to the reborn Thinking Machine empire. As futars were detected by the no-ship from space above the world, this development caused joy for Hrrm and his half-human/half-feline compatriots, as they believed they had finally found their home.

The ''Ithaca'' crew went down to the jungle world in one group, but were soon separated into two separate parties guided by the futar's Handlers. This caused Sheeana, [[Miles Teg]], in one group; and the Jewish [[Rabbi/XD|Rabbi]], and the ghola of Thurfit Hawat, in the second group; to be especially on guard. The leader of the Handlers told Sheeana and the group that a special ceremony was to be provided especially for them—the hunting and killing of five [[Honored Matre]]s by a clan of futars, and that Hrrm and his sub-clan would be allowed to participate.

====Escape from the Handlers====
Immediately the five captured Honored Matre was led into the hunting grounds, where they put up a long and bitter battle against Hrrm and the other ''homo sapien felinius'' creatures, but it was to no avail. As the devouring of their carcass progressed, it became evident to Sheeana and Miles that the Handlers were indeed Face Dancers, and that the landing party were to be the next victims. Sheeana immediately yelled out to Hawat and the Rabbi, who were in another observation pod, to get back to the ''Ithaca'' by any means necessary. Miles re-awakened his faster-than-sight fighting abilities, and killed many of the Face Dancers as they stood in the way of his and Sheeana's escape back to the landing craft.

As their landing craft safely boarded the ''Ithaca'', Sheeana and Teg disembarked. Sheeana raced to the bridge of the vessel, and had to bring Idaho out of trance that he had hypnotized himself into, as he thought of the sexual bonding he had gone through years earlier with [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]]. Sheeana then yelled at Idaho to keep a sharp look out for the returning landing craft of Hawat. As Hawat's craft reached the ''Ithaca'', it was rammed stridently by those the Face Dancers/Handlers, but managed to navigate into the landing bay, and though it caught on fire, both Hawat and the Rabbi were able to disembark. Two other Handler craft tried to ram the ''Ithaca'' to damage it, but Idaho was able to fold space to safety, just as [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]] again tried to capture the vessel in their [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]]. As the ''Ithaca'' sped away to safety, the net was severely damaged.

===Freeing Duncan Idaho===
Immediately afterwards, Sheeana took it upon herself to free Idaho from the sexual enslavement that he still felt towards Murbella. Using all of her Bene Gesserit techniques, Sheeana used her stamina over the course of an evening to break the hold that [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]] had on Idaho. Later in a ceremony to end his dependence once and for all, Duncan eliminated all traces of Murbella from his life, even down to her stray hairs that had been in his private quarters.

===More Gholas, and Sabotage'===
Nineteen years after the ''Ithaca'' left Chapterhouse, Sheeana decided to restart the ghola project. She realized that the ''Ithaca'' was under-populated, and could accommodate a human population hundreds of times greater than it currently carried. She also craved the special abilities of the gholas she created, in the upcoming battle with the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]] that she knew would eventually occur. Sheeana decided to create [[Alia Atriedes/XD|Alia Atreides]], and she was decanted, and began her growth.

After twenty-one years had passed, Sheeana had finally convinced Garimi of the import of the ghola program, even that of Scytale's replicant, his own ghola. To accelerate the program, and acting upon a haunch of her own prescient powers and whom the Enemey was, Sheeana decided to create gholas of [[Xavier Harkonnen]], [[Serena Butler]], and the great general [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]]. The program was slowed and thwarted, as a saboteur aboard the no-ship killed the gholas just before they could be decanted; and the [[axlotl tanks]] that carried them. The ship's leader of security, Thufir Hawat quizzed much of the ship's staff, but he found that the tank's security equipment had been tampered with, and rendered useless.

== Last Years ==
===Qelso===
Both Sheeana and Idaho were surprised, as were all aboard, as the ''Ithaca''[ came out of fold-space above the fruitful, but dying planet of [[Qelso]], and both Sheeana and Duncan wondered at Idaho's developing prescient ability. Qelso had been a seed world that [[Mother Superior]] [[Darwi Odrade]] had sent sisters to, and had been seeded with sand-trout to begin a spice cycle. The inhabitants were openly hostile to the Bene Gesserit for this reason, and killed [[Stokes]] when they found out she was of the Sisterhood. The natives held hostage some of the crew that went down to the planet.  Duncan, who stayed invisible to the Enemy as long as he was on the ship, decided to rescue the group.

It was unneeded as the natives released Sheeana, Teg, and the others; but the gholas of Stilgar and Kynes stayed behind to help the bitter natives adapt to the encroaching desert and the ever increasing number of sandworms on the world. Since Idaho had made himself vulnerable to the watchful eyes of [[Daniel/XD|Daniel]] and [[Marty/XD|Marty]], and the ''Ithaca'' had to fold space again to safety. 

===Final Sabotage', and Capture===
Later, against Sheeana's advice, when the ghola of Leto II went to commune with the sandworms that were in the hold of the ship, the ghola Hawat went to guard him should the giant beasts turn on the young man. The worms, led by [[Monarch]], reared up when Hawat entered the hold, and immediately killed Hawat, and showed him to be an Enhanced Face Dancer. This led to a ship wide search for other saboteurs that might be involved in subversion. To question everyone aboard at the same time, all of the inhabitants of the Ithaca were called to the main assembly hall, and were questioned intently by Sheeana and her fellow truthsayers.

But it was the ghola of Scytale who used the old Tleilaxu [[Whistling language]], which caused all Face Dancers muscles and visages to momentarily become jumbled. It was revealed that the Rabbi was indeed an Enhanced Face Dancer, and the Dancer stole away to the vessel's bridge, killed [[Garimi]], and locked himself in. The Dancer immediately began to destroy the ship's navigation, cloaking, and engine systems; and the ship returned to visibility. Idaho remembered back, and realized the Dancers must have boarded years earlier, at the planet of the Handlers, and killed the ''real'' Rabbi and Hawat.

Immediately the [[tachyon net/XD|tachyon net]] reappeared, and Thinking Machine starships began to surround the no-ship. The ghola of Alia managed to sneak into the cockpit of the ''Ithaca'', killing the Dancer, and opened the area. Idaho and Teg raced into the control room, Teg then went into hyper-movement, and raced around the ship at sonic speed, and repaired all of the ship's systems. As Duncan engaged the [[Holtzman Engine/XD|Holtzman Engine]]s, a Machine starship rammed the ''Ithaca'', and forced it into submission. Idaho and Sheeana signaled surrender, and the ship was brought to the Machine Capital of [[Synchrony]], as the inhabitants of the no-ship realized that their Enemy were Thinking Machines. 

==On the Day of Kralizec==
===Battle in Synchrony===
Most of the passengers associated directly with the ghola of Paul Atreides were led to the [[Cathedral]] in the heart of Synchrony by the ghola of [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], the Machine Ruler [[Erasmus]], and Face Dancer and Machine guards; Sheeana and Leto, and many of the ship's inhabitants were left behind and stayed on the ship, with ideas of their own. Duncan and Sheeana directed Scytale to use a nerve gas that he had created on the Enhanced Face Dancers that had surrounded the vessel, and the gas's potency killed thousands of the Dancers. Duncan, before going into the heart of Synchrony, the Cathedral, armed some of the Bene Gesserit crew of the ''Ithaca'', such as [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mothers]] [[Calissa]] and [[Elyen]], with weapons to fight the Machines. This caused [[Khrone]], their leader, to become frustrated with the Battle, and race to the Cathedral to report to the Machine Lords.

===Destruction of Synchrony===
After he left,  Leto communicated with [[Monarch]] and the rest of the sandworms in the ship's hold, and he told Sheeana that they desired to be released out into the semi-arid world. Sheeana knew of their destructive power, and together they released the sandworms into the Machine capital. Guided by Leto and Sheeana, the worms destroyed much of the Machine city as they burrowed deep into the planet's crust, and as they came up they shattered many of the flow-metal buildings and plazas.

===Events in the Cathedral===
As Sheeana, Leto, and Scytale continued their destruction of the minions and buildings of Synchrony, galaxy alerting events occurred in the Cathedral. The two gholas of Paul Atreides and [[Paolo]] battled and dueled to Paolo ending up in a coma, and Omnius was banished permanently to another plane of existence by [[Oracle of Time]].

The loss of the Omnius [[Evermind]] contributed even more greatly to Sheeana and Leto's guidance of the worms destruction, as the robotic machines were near paralyzed in dealing with the worms as they coursed through their main city. In the Cathedral as he faced Duncan Idaho and Erasmus, and knowing that the machines were distracted by the melee; enabled Khrone, leader of the Enhanced Face Dancers, to declare that the time of Face Dancer hegemony over the [[Known Universe]] had arrived. To counter this threat, Erasmus then activated his long before-placed "[[kill switch]]" he had put into their genetic make up hundreds of years before, and using the galaxy-wide tachyon net, all of Khrone's Face Dancers throughout the Known Universe were instantly killed.

Before the sandworms could reduce all of Synchrony to rubble, the Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], Duncan Idaho, was revealed. He shared throughout flow-metal memory with Erasmus, creating a man/machine super-being who would guide the galaxies in a future of peace and prosperity.

===Good Bye to Leto===
No longer needing to guide the sandworms on a course of destruction, Leto mused with Sheeana over the prior friendship that they had shared since his decanting years earlier. Sheeana realized the great burden that her friend Leto carried with him, that the "pearl of awareness" of Leto was in each and every sandworm of the universe. Knowing that Leto would be happiest when embonded as one with the giant creatures, she watched as he placed his body as a type of genetic material inside on the worms ring casings. Leto merged with the worm, and became this time, a non-conscious human/sandworm genetic entity

==Bene Gesserit School on Synchrony==
Duncan guiding the future of mankind, decided to give Synchrony all factions of the Known Universe, as a type of peace monument to the cooperation of all races. Sheeana, with the approval of Murbella, founded a completely separate Bene Gesserit school out of the remains of the ''Ithaca'' near the Cathedral. With her on the planet was Scytale, who was allowed to start a re-built of the Tleilaxu culture on a different part of the world.

To show complete cooperation was the remains of the Thinking Machine Empire, in the form of semi-independent robots that also lived on the planet. Sheeana also raised up, with Scytale's help, a ghola of Serena Butler, and she was being raised to be a successor to the Fremen leader.

Sandworm/Featured
{{FeatArchive}}

The '''sandworm''' is a native lifeform of the planet [[Arrakis]]. It lives in the vast sand dunes that stretch across the surface of the planet, and is a by-product of the same process that creates the [[Spice Melange]].

Sandworms typically stay beneath submerged in the sand, although occasionally they will surface. They are attracted to rhythmic vibrations, including human footsteps, which perturb them and will cause them to attack the source.

[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|Sandworm, from the cover of 'Heretics of Dune', published by ACE Books.]]

== Physical Characteristics ==
Sandworm can grow to a huge size. Specimens up to 400 meters long have been spotted by humans in the [[deep desert]]s of Arrakis. They naturally live to a great age, ranging in the thousands of years, unless killed by humans or other sandworms.

In appearance their skin is thick and protective. It is comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size, that overlap to form an armor to protect against sand abrasion. But as the [[Fremen]] discovered, prying one or more scales up causes irritation. The sandworm will roll itself until the prone scale is at the highest point from the desert floor, so as to avoid sand getting trapped beneath it. This weakness is used by the [[Fremen]] to control the direction and speed of the creature, thus making them a viable method of transporting people.

Internally the sandworm is a massive furnace, producing almost unimaginable heat. The forward end of the creature possesses a huge yawing mouth that can easily consume large ground vehicles, including [[spice harvesters]]. A strong flinty, cinnamon smell exudes from the open mouth of the '''sandworm'''. The '''sandworm''' is highly susceptible to water poisoning.

== Creation of Sandworms ==
The sandworm is created when [[sandtrout]] band together after converting water deep beneath the surface of [[Arrakis]] into a liquid chemical that the '''sandworm''' is capable of digesting without being poisoned. This chemical then erupts up to desert's surface in a [[pre-spice mass]].

The sandtrout that survive this event then coalesce and are metamorphasized into a young sandworm.

== Cultural Impact of the Sandworm ==
Up until the ascendancy of [[Paul Atreides]] to the position of Emperor, the '''sandworm''' had virtually no impact on the humanity outside [[Arrakis]].

Yet to the planet's [[Fremen]] population it was a spiritual symbol of their faith, who saw the creatures as physical embodiments of the One God of their original Zensunni religion. Within Fremen culture the '''sandworm''' had several additional names, notably [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously means 'Old Man of the Desert', 'Old Father Eternity', and 'Grandfather of the Desert', as well as alluding to its perceived deific qualities.

Young '''sandworms''' are also sought by the [[Fremen]] for special ceremonies. When poisoned with water, the young '''sandworm''' is killed, but not before it chemically alters some of the water and expels it through its mouth. This liquid, known to the [[Fremen]] as the [[Water of Life]], is used to induct new [[Bene Gesserit]] reverend mothers. The toxic liquid forces the prospective reverend mother to either purify the water or die. During this process dormant [[genetic memories]] and other abilities are activated, heralding the creation of a new reverend mother.

After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the [[Zensunni]] religion, the reverence paid to the '''sandworm''' spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II]], in no small part because of his merger with sandtrout to form a hybrid human-sandworm being.

== Decline of the Sandworm ==
The terraforming of [[Arrakis]] posed a grave risk to the '''sandworm''', which found life outside the arid desert poisonous. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself had devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the '''sandworm''' once again thrive on Arrakis for a few thousand years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during [[the Scattering]]. The exact success of these samples remains unclear as of the end of ''''Chapterhouse: Dune''''.

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on [[Arrakis]], including the '''sandworm'''. But not before their enemies had spirited away at least one more of the creatures, which accompanied them on their escape from the unified [[Bene Gesserit]]/[[Honored Matres]] organization and into uncharted space.

Usul/DE
{{encyclopedia}}
'''Usul''' was a [[Fremen language|Fremen]] word meaning "the strength of the base of the pillar". It was also a figure of Fremen folklore that was later merged with the figure of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]].

==Legend==
Many legends existed about the life and deeds of Usul, both before and after the appearance of Paul Muad'dib.

According to a legend "How Muad'dib took his name", recorded in [[Ibarhimal-Yazizh]]'s ''[[Fremen Folktales from Onn]]'' SAH 313, Usul was "a King's son". 

In this version, Usul was still a boy when he decided to leave his [[sietch/DE|sietch]] before his ''[[minha]]'', the season of testing, as his mother reminded him. Nevertheless he left to the desert and as the sun was setting, he saw some little way off [[Kalatorano|a castle]] made all of sand. 

Inside the castle was a room, empty but for a table of sand on which stood a jug of [[liban]] and a bowl with some apricots and after he ate, he lay down to sleep. Then the voice of [[Alhen]] (Death), "Naib of All the Djinn" threatened him for entering his castle and eating his meal. 

Usul replied: ''"Jild an havy ma tumal minn-u harakis"'' (Shoes are not made of the hide of a living animal). Then the marid laughed and grabbed Usul by his hair and threw him into a pit in the center of the castle.

Usul sat at the bottom of the pit and a small mouse appeared and told him ''"Ya mawla, argab aanina!"''. Its wife gave birth and its tribe would starve without it, so it asked Usul to throw it over the pit. As Usul did this, the mouse replied ''"Tija al-sadaqa"'' "The gift will return to the giver" and Usul passed the rest of the night alone.

The next morning, the jinn grabbed Usul from his hair and threw him in the desert. 

===First djinn===
Then a mouse introduced as [[Mixabbi]] and advised Usul to learn from it. The mouse began to sniff the wind and to watch the spray of sand from the dune tops. Τhe mouse burrowed then stopped as the sand drifted down. When the mouse found the shadow of the wind, where the burrow did not collapse, it tunneled deeper and curled up inside with its nose deep inside its fur. 

The wind rose until before him there stood what seemed like a swirl of winds in the shape of a man, the Yellow Djinni [[Azfar]] who would eat Usul. Then following the mouse's example, he found the shadow of the wind on the lee side of a dune and crawled from place to place, testing the sand. When he found what the mouse had taught, he dug into the sand and
scooped himself a burrow. Usul waited until the storm blew itself out. 

Then Azfar told Usul that he won. If Usul ever became free, Azfar would do one service. 

===Second djinn===
When Usul tried to reply,  he foudn himself in a cavern. Then a mouse came, introduced as [[Rauhanin]] and showed him "peace": it hopped to the floor and crouched as if it were praying without moving no matter what Usul did. Thinking that the mouse was dead, put it on the floor again only to see it rise, shake itself, and run off as a distant rumble was heard until Usul's head rang. 

It was [[Ahmar]], the Red Djinni who would eat him. Usul thought he could bear no more of the loud beating, and fell to his knees, clutching his ears and grinding his teeth. Thinking of the mouse, he looked deeper and deeper inside of himself, for the small place where all is quiet. He looked and breathed from the center of his soul, and as he looked, he heard the drum less and less. Then he found the silent place, and rested there in reverence. 

Then, a pebble had fallen on him and Ahmar replied weakly and distantly when Usul becomes his own master, the djinni would do him a service. 
===Third djinn===
Usul found himself on an omnidirectional gray floor, stretching as far as he could see all round him, with a gray sky over all. Then a mouse came and introduced as [[Basbasiyah]]. It lept to the floor and began to wiggle its tail, hpping, jumping and dancing until Usul laughed. 

A drop of water fallen on his face and through moans and sad noises, from a dask cloud caame a sorrowful voice. It was [[Abiad]] the White Djinni that would eat him. He saw his mother and sister sorrowful for missing him. Usul started crying and feeling very sad and alone until remembered the mouse. He started laughing and before he knew it, the gray land was alive with his mirth and the echoes answered his laugh with giggles and chuckles. Then [[Abiad]] said that once he would free himself, he would not forget that Usul bested him.

Usul again found himself in the pit. It was night and once again fell to sleep. The morning Alhen again grabbed him and said that since Usul escaped his donkeys, whether he would do something to gain his freedom. But Usul would not ask anything. Then the Djinn asked from Usul [[portyguls]] from a garden. Usul said he would do it "but only because it pleases me to get some portyguls myself". 

As he left, he felt his own master again, and thought it was his ''[[al-awwal nahar]]'', for in wonders and adventures it has surely been 'the first day'. His [[hajra]] ended and he saw the garden, near sunrise.

He called [[Khala]], folk of the air to show him the portyguls. After he ate, he took three for the djinn, and then boasted that the garden is unguarded and any outcast would enter. The djinns replied that they were imprisoned there because he could not reach their hearth by nightfall. Then Usul realized he could not return to the same way because he would fail to return in time. 
===Return journey===
To that purpose he marked where the sun rose and set a course straight and fast for Alhen's castle. 

His path led him over a jagged rock wall, from which he looked at [[kaymus]], dust sand, in the basin. He ran down the slope, until he felt no ground and fell in a pit filled with ''[[bar almeda]]'' and sunk until could not breathe. Then he called Azfar. Since Usul was not free, the djinn asked for one of the portyguls. The djinn then lifted Usul from his cloak. Then a mouse came and Usul boasted. But the mouse replied "You had a djinni to help you. If a hawk should snatch me from a scorpion, that does not make the scorpion my slave nor the hawk my ally." 

As he crossed a low range of dunes. He stepped steadily across the salt basin, heading for a ridge of rock on the far side. When he came to the very middle of the place, he felt [[drum sand]] and this [[atambal]] would call a worm. The drum sand would give him firm footing, he knew, and he judged the distance to the rocks carefully. He then asked help from Ahmar. The djinn asked him for a portygul because he was not free, and with his drum he sped, luring the [[sandworm/DE|sandworm]]. Usul made his way to the rocks and sat down to catch his breath. Then a mouse came to whom Usul boasted but it replied "Make sure when you cross the desert you always have Ahmar's drum at your call and no worms will bother you." 

Usul thought as he proceeded that while he had not beaten the uncaring earth nor the greedy worm, and he was thirsty. 
Usul lay flat on the desert sands, too weak to move. Two mice came and talked about him. They said that this boy was not Usul master of Dune because he is not his own master. Then he called Abiad, to weep and slake his thirst. Once more, the djinn noted that Usul is not free.

But Usul replied that he is free because it's to his will to bear or to bow, to endure or to submit, and the mightiest
naib can say no more. If I were to die in chains, I will still have a freedom that no one can take from him.

The djinn again asked for a portygul as a reward but Usul said no, because he would eat it himself; he did not intend to return to Alhen.

Once he found himself in the pit with the djinn angry, since Usul broke his promise. But then, Usul gave him the portygul he still held. The djinn then realized it was bested and offered him anything, even the whole [[Arrakis/DE|planet]]. Usul denied saying that the djinn "can give me nothing that I lack or cannot get for myself". 

He took only a gift himself would give. A name: the name of his preceptors, whose teaching brought him through all troubles. The new name shall be called 'Mouse'.

==Paul Atreides==
It was the name given to [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]] when he was given sanctuary with [[Sietch Tabr]] by its [[naib/DE|naib]], [[Stilgar/DE|Stilgar]]. Openly Paul was to be referred to as [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)|Muad'Dib]]. However, Usul was the private name used within the Sietch. It was to be the name his beloved [[Chani/DE|Chani]] would use for him, and the last word she cried before she died giving birth to their children.

Stilgar gave Paul this name after witnessing him defeat one of their finest wariors, [[Jamis]]. It would appear that Stilgar saw a certain strength in the boy.

Ishmael
{{Expanded}}{{Character_infobox|name=Ishmael|birth=[[211 BG]]|birthplace=[[Poritrin]]|title=*[[Naib]] of the [[Wormrider]]s|family=*[[El'hiim]] (stepson)|debut=[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]|book name=[[Dune: The Butlerian Jihad]]|loyalty=*[[Zensunni]]
**[[Free Men of Arrakis]]
***[[Freemen of Arrakis]]}}

'''Naib Ishmael''' [b. [[211 BG]]] was the [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] who formed the [[Free Men of Dune|Free Men of Arrakis]] from both slave refugees from [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]] and the outlaws of the late [[Selim Wormrider]], and became the first [[Naib]] of the Free Men. Later, he led the portion of the Free Men who became known as [[Freemen of Dune]] and later [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] into the deep desert. 

== History ==

===Slavery on Poritrin===
When he was only about 10 years old, he witnessed the arrival of [[Tlulaxa]] [[slavers]] [[Tlulaxa raid on Harmonthep|assaulting]] his village. He and his cousin [[Taina]] were captured and taken to [[Poritrin/XD|Poritrin]]. Initially he worked in the slimy mudflats of [[Isana]], scooping clam seedlings and rushing them out into the wet fields.

Soon he was moved to the mansion of [[Tio Holtzman]] and entered his team of [[solvers]]; he became friends with the unruly [[Aliid]] who was a [[Zenshiite]]. Aliid proposed him to make a prank by deliberately entering wrong mathematical formulas. Fortunately, the mistakes were detected by Holtzman who then punished his solvers.

Ishmael was transferred in a slave team that constructed a giant mosaic in a canyon wall of the [[Isana]] river. During the rebellion of [[Bel Moulay]], he and Aliid destroyed their own work on the mosaic, and then punished by whipping. The rebellion was soon quieted down and the two boys watched Bel Moulay's cruel execution, and was remembered for the years to come.

Years later, Ishmael had a wife, [[Ozza]], who gave him two daughters, [[Chamal]] and [[Falina]]. Ishmael grew with docile belief, remembering nostalgically the sutras and stories told to him by his grandfather. He recited them to his co-slaves, gave them courage and strengthened their faith, although the more defiant, Aliid, used to scorn his meekness.

Ishmael worked constructing the decoy fleet that fooled the machines during their [[attack against Poritrin]], and idea by [[Vorian Atreides]] that saved the planet. Moved by Aliid and others who demanded recognition for their labor and better living conditions, Ishmael audaciously attempted to meet and talk with Lord [[Niko Bludd]] personally. Because of his disrespect, he was separated from his family taken to work for [[Norma Cenva/XD|Norma Cenva]] with other 130 slaves.

During that time, Ishmael continued to preach and tell stories to the Zensunni comrades who came to him. The Zensiites with Aliid rested on different quarters. After some years, among a new batch of 30 slaves, Ishamel recognized his daughter, Chamal (with her husband [[Rafel]]) who were also taken to work for Cenva.
===Escape to Arrakis===
Soon, Ishmael learned of Aliid's and the Zenshiite's plot to revolt on the 28th anniversary of the rebellion on Poritrin. Ishmael was a pacifist, and preached non-violence - giving hope to other slaves by telling them that God will grant them freedom if they are patient.

During Aliid's slave revolt, Ishmael with the help of Rafel and others, forced [[Tuk Keedair]] to take his band of slaves to freedom. Keedair made sure to warn them that he is no pilot and the only coordination he remembered was of [[Arrakis]]. Eventually, using the [[space-folding]] technology, they arrived on the desert planet and crashed on the sand.

The slaves soon realized the world was hostile, with scarce moisture, no vegetation and poor fauna, under a hot sun. Several scouting attempts resulted in tragedy. After five months of waiting, 1/3 of the slaves were dead.

Then, [[Jafar]] found them, hearing the claims of Tuk Keedair about the lost slaves, and came to find them. He accepted them to the band of the [[Wormrider]] outlaws after the death of [[Selim Wormrider]] and the Poritrin slaves joined their population.

Ishmael met Selim's widow, [[Marha]], who indoctrinated the ideals of Selim. Ishmael took care of her son, [[El'hiim]], and even saved his life when it was endangered by [[Scorpion]]s in the desert. Eventually Ishmael and Marha felt a mutual attraction and they were joined in marriage. Around that time Ishmael became the [[Naib]] of the Wormriders' village

In the following years Marha died. El'hiim insisted that she would receive treatment from scientists of the [[Arrakis City]], but Ishmael, having now adopted the ideals of Selim, denied to trust the offworlders. Marha had listened to her husband and In El'hiim's view that had led directly to her death. Marha made Ishmael swear to shelter and advise her son.

===Selim and El'hiim===
When El'hiim grew up. he became the Naib of the [[Wormrider]]s but his stepfather perhaps had applied too much pressure, unwittingly forcing him to turn in another direction. El'hiim but was changed by the new experiences and was radically different than his father. To Ishmael's dismay, the young Naib trusted offworlders and insisted that they should buy commodities by trading spice.

Ishmael often scorned his stepson about their conflicting views, but respected his position as the Naib. Eventually the village was assaulted by [[slavers]] but they were repelled successfully.

Ishmael decided to re-educate El'hiim. They both went to a pilgrimage in the [[Tanzerouft]] riding a [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]], and make him remember the wild way of living on Arrakis. However on their return home, they found their village devastated by slavers who returned during their absence, kidnapping several young men and women. The young Naib realized from a fabric tissue that the attackers were from [[Zanbar]] and knew where they were.

El'hiim traveled to Arrakis City where the authorities promised to enforce certain regulations against kidnapping. Not trusting the word of the outsiders, Ishmael organised a meeting of the Zensunnis at their main settlement in the faraway cliffs. Accompanided by a reluctant El'hiim, they reached the slavers' camp; they counted about a dozen. After disabling the lighting with [[maula rifle]]s, they fell on them with their crystal and wormtooth [[knives]]. During the fray, Ishmael caught [[Wariff]], the unrepentant [[Tlulaxa]] man who saved years ago. Ishmael remembered the words of his aggressive friend Aliid and started to endorse them; he commanded his men to seek payment in blood and return it to the desert as water.

Following the successful kanla raid, Ishmael and El'hiim argued about Ishmael's violent attack on the slavers, particularly the draining of their enemies' blood to take their water. While El'hiim preferred trade and contact with offworlders, Ishmael advocated returning to the ways of Selim Wormrider and retreating to the deepest deserts. Unable to reconcile their differences, Ishmael challenged his adopted son to a duel and disowned him, slapping him twice as with the custom to invoke deep insult. With El'hiim unwilling to fight him, Ishmael demanded a sandworm duel. 

During the sandworm duel, Ishmael and El'hiim charged their sandworms at each other. However, the duel ended in El'hiim's favor when Ishmael lost control of his sandworm, allowing El'hiim's sandworm to gain the upper hand and drive his sandworm away. Having lost the leadership of the clan, a defeated Ishmael led several Zensunni supporters from El'hiim's village into the dangerous Tanzerouft desert. There, he and his followers vowed to build their own isolated settlements and avoid contact with outsiders.

Warrick
{{Expanded}}

[[File:Fremen-cabalgusanos-by-aaron-miller.jpg|thumb|Fremen Wormrider by Aaron Miller]]

'''Warrick''' was a [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] from [[Red Wall Sietch]], the blood-brother of [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]] and first husband of [[Faroula]]. Friends from early childhood, Warrick accompanied Liet Kynes, on many of the routine and everyday occurrences that Liet experienced as a teenager. 

==Dominic Vernius==
As the two grew into men, they discovered the hidden hideout of the former [[Earl]] [[Dominic Vernius]] who had established an underground base on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]' [[Southern Polar Region]]. Discovered by the Earl's men while delivering the annual [[melange/XD|melange]] tribute to the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]], Warrick and Liet were led before the renegade nobleman. The exiled leader of [[House Vernius]] agreed to spare the lives of the young duo, and Warrick and Liet agreed to help the help Dominic better hide his base. Released by Vernius, Warrick and his close friend never told of the Antarctic location.

==Marriage to Faroula==
As the two progressed into adulthood, their eyes were caught by a young Fremen women named Faroula, daughter of the [[Naib]] of their sietch. Liet confided in Warrick that he had written poetry about Faroula, but the ever confident Warrick sadly stated that Liet would probably never share the words with her. Warrick further re-iterated that he, too, was interested in the teen Fremen maiden. Finally, Faroula issued a marriage challenge to both, including Warrick, leaving them a note in each of their quarters, that she could be found in the far away [[Cave of Birds]]. The first of the two young males to find her, would be her betrothed.

Warrick summoned a Giant [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]],and used his [[Maker hooks]] to guide the beast across the sands of [[Dune]]. Warrick arrived at the Cave just a few moments earlier than Liet did, and as Warrick and Faroula pledged their lives to each other, Liet slowly turned around, and did not interrupt his friend's tender moment.

==The Coriolis Storm==
Liet left the Sietch soon afterwards, embittered about his loss of the hand of Faroula, and headed for the Antarctic regions of the planet. Warrick and Faroula were formally married soon afterward, and within a year, their son, [[Liet-chih]] was born. A few months later, Liet gave word to the Sietch that he was returning to his extended family. Liet gave word to Warrick, and told him to meet him in the Southern Polar Region. Warrick was overjoyed, and the two had a short-lived reunion.

On the way back to their ancient homestead, a fierce [[Coriolis storm]] began to come near them from faroff in the desert. The sandworm that they were riding fled deep into the sand as the giant storm approached. A small out-cropping of rock, only big enough for one man, was the only shelter that the duo could find. The two lifelong friends struggled as to whom should use the rock shelter, as the other would almost certainly die, due to being exposed to the fercious sand winds. Warrick debated that Liet should use the shelter, as he was the son of [[Umma]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]]. Liet demanded that Warrick use the shelter, as he had a wife and child to take care of. As neither would "take no for an answer", and the storm was almost upon them, they left their fate to chance, to throwing [[stick]]s. Warrick cast first, and rolled a score of seven; Liet acquired a nine. As the two argued still further, the storm came upon them, and Warrick pushed Liet into the enclosure.

==The Water of Life==
Warrick was critically wounded and blinded, the skin scoured from his face and parts of his body, and Liet took him back to the Sietch. Warrick chose to drink the [[Water of Life]] in an attempt to discover more about the [[Lisan al Gaib]] and died in the process.

Over the years, his sietch had prospered, the population had not decreased, and their hidden stockpiles of water grew with every cycle of the moons.

His tribe took in [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes]] after he assisted and saved the life of young [[Stilgar]] during a fight with Harkonnen troopers. Heinar was troubled about what to do with the stranger, and after consulting with the elders [[Jerath]], [[Aliid (Fremen)|Aliid]] and [[Garnah]], he decided to execute him.

==As a Fremen Soldier==
Enno was trained by [[Gurney Halleck/XD|Gurney Halleck]] on [[Arrakis]] to learn to swim as the old musician warrior knew that the Jihad would take the soldiers to water-oriented worlds. Halleck placed a [[Corrino]] [[solari]] at the bottom of a giant water tank, and declared that whomever retrieved the coin would win a prize. Enno strived to be the most faithful of Paul Atreides' soldier fanatics, and brought up the metallic object from the water, though he was deathly afraid of the liquid. Unfamiliar with swimming, he almost drowned in the process, and had to be revived by medics.

Later, as Gurney led the Fremen against the forces of [[Lord]] [[Colus]] on the planet [[Galicia]], Enno encouraged the Fremen to not only attack whatever soldiers Colus could muster, but to also cause extensive civilian damage. Enno and the Jihadists burned down villages, with families inside, as he believed it to be the will of the [[Emperor]]. Even after Colus surrendered to Halleck, and Gurney agreed to spare his life, Enno secretly beheaded the man, and placed his head on a spike. Much to the dismay of the Fremen troops that Halleck led, Gurney called for Enno to be brought forth, and personally slit his throat; and placed Enno's head on the spike outside Colus' former villa.

Zensunni/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Zensunni}}

[[File:C306782831b898192fcecff680c9e755.jpg|thumb|Rogue Zensunni -Fanart]]

'''Zensunni''' was a religious belief system prominent with many cultures spread across the [[Known Universe]], especially those descended from disadvantaged and enslaved peoples. 

== History ==
They were followers of a schismatic sect that broke away from the teachings of [[Maometh]] about [[1381 BG]]. Most scholars name [[Ali Ben Ohashi]] as leader of the original schism but there is some evidence that Ohashi may have been merely the male spokesman for his second wife, [[Nisai]] <ref>[[Terminology of the Imperium]]</ref>.

In accordance with their devotion, the Zensunni believed that they owed no allegiance to any secular
government and the sect found most of its followers in those peoples already disposed to self-government; on [[Terra]] the Zensunni represented a small fraction (in [[1572 AG]] there were less than 50,000) and they preferred nomadic isolated life in places such as the [[Sahara Desert]].

Their [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|migration]] started in [[2800 AG]] when [[Siridar]] [[Baron]] of [[Terra]], [[Charles Mikarrol]], forcefully sent two million Zensunni to [[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]], to comply with [[Elrood V]]'s order who wished to populate the planet.

During their stay on [[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]] Zensunni developed understanding of neural physiology and this understanding led to the [[distrans/DE|distrans]]; Zensunni never relied on [[thinking machines]]. Over several generations, on [[Rossak/DE|Rossak]], under the guidance of their [[Sayyadina/DE|Sayyadina]] they rolled back 16,000 years of language change. On [[Harmonthep/DE|Harmonthep]] they invented the first [[paracompass/DE|paracompass]] and on [[Ishia]] they developed the [[stilltent/DE|stilltent]]. The Zensunni had been used as laborers of many different types.

Zensunni homeworld was considered to be legendary [[Nilotic al-Ourouba]].

Later, the Zensunni predisposition was manipulated by the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]], via their [[Missionaria Protectiva/DE|Missionaria Protectiva]] arm and [[Panoplia Propheticus]] strategy, for their own political objectives. Their last station, [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], was of particular interest in this regard. The exclusivity of the critical [[spice/DE|Spice Melange]] on the planet made the resident [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]], staunch followers of Zensunni, of natural interest to the Bene Gesserit. It is theorized an early contact with the [[Bene Gesserit/DE|Bene Gesserit]] which would explain because of the interrelation between the BG and the Fremen Motherhood. 

The emergence of the powerful [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]], and his adoption of Fremen ways, gave Zensunni beliefs a dramatic new popularity. After his ascension to [[Emperor]] Paul embarked on a ferocious jihad that brought great violence and turmoil. The stark contrast of these actions vis-à-vis pacifist Zensunni beliefs was not lost on some of the faithful.

The [[Preacher]] sought to reawaken the relapsed Fremen to their Zensunni heritage

== Core Beliefs ==
Little is known of the evolution of the Zensunni faith. What is beyond doubt is that the Zensunni belief was an amalgamation of two ancient religions: ''[[Sunni]] Islam'' and ''[[Zen]] Buddhism''. The Zensunni religion is noted chiefly for its emphasis on the mystical and a reversion to "the ways  of the fathers." The Zensunni mixed heritage of Zen and Sunni traditions became mingled with other deep-strata convictions during their long [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|quest]]. 

Its underlying purpose was to answer the''[[sunnah]]'' — the ten thousand religious questions posed by the [[Shari-a]] — with mystical understanding, and not with the more usual rational approaches

Their religion was severe in the extreme. It demanded close obedience to an authority figure who must have literally had the power of life and death over his subjects which in Fremen religion materialized on the [[naib/DE|naib]].

As a faith, Zensunni has beliefs such as the existence of [[Auliya]] as God's handmaiden and the ''[[ilm]]'' and ''[[figh]]''

A cult of mystics practiced ''[[siayla]]'' "Light of Truth", held annually among the Zensunni to discuss the progress made toward their religious goals during a year.

Their interest in messianic psychology, for instance, was augmented by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]]'s long-range planning. "Hearthside supersititions" were accumulated in non-desert surroundings. The addictive spice-water ecology entered the Fremen society on Arrakis. So it is not easy to
be certain what parts of their theology (Urn), ritual and behavioral assumptions were as ancient as their Terran origins. 

Zensunni beliefs parallel the cultural patterns of the [[Orange Catholic Bible/DE|OCB]]: a model calls of a Creation for the benefit of Humankind, the Fall of Man, and a tempestuous battle at some predetermined but unspecified End, between Good and Evil.

The Zensunni were monotheists, believing in a god who does not interfere in day-today events but determines the overall pattern of temporal affairs;  merciful and compassionate rather than vengeful. Since the later Fremen prohibited tombs, this indicates that a spiritual rather than bodily afterlife was large in their anticipations, with water at the core of the dreams of paradise (yet [[Leto II/DE|Leto II]]'s satisfactory description of the Paradise to Come implies that physical senses would be rekindled after death). [[Pardot Kynes/DE|Pardot Kynes]]' plans for the terraforming of [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]] certainly harmonized with the Fremen's ultimate hopes. On their way to Paradise, the Fremen expected a grand [[Kralizec|devastation]], the Typhoon
Wind at the end.

The ancient model of specific Beginning and Ending, when thrived, was neither peculiar nor consistent and all-inclusive: Each system, separate satellite, and sometimes different communication groups or "sects" of "all-believers" on a single satellite, believed that they were the Chosen; its population alone would survive the climax-battle, and reinforced their community through prejudice against strangers (the "unwashed" or the "infidel") who did not accept their metaphysics and rituals- This tendency to splinter instead of embrace is noteworthy because, a heritage of persecution and enslavement and flight can compress a culture of believers into patient fanatics. Defeat and exile were transformed by the faithful Wanderers into [[hajr]] and eventually into vengeful triumph — [[jihad]] — where the true believers struck back and justified the long-nurtured reciprocity of faith in the Creator and Creator's faith in The People.

Sandworm/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Sandworm}}

[[Image:sandworm heretics.jpg|thumb|a sandworm of Arrakis.]]
This article is about the creature, Sandworm. For information on the novel ''Sandworms of Dune'', by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J Anderson]], see ''[[Sandworms of Dune (novel)|Sandworms of Dune]]''. 
 
The sandworm was a native life-form of the planet [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]. It lived in the vast deserts and sand dunes that stretched across the surface of the planet. Simply put, the sandworm was an essential factor in the creation of the [[Spice Melange/XD|melange]]. 

Sandworms lived beneath the sand. Attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations. This was an effort to defend their territory, of which they were highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, was extremely rare, save for the mysterious [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]], who had achieved some kind of mastery over the beast. 

==Characteristics==

The Sandworm was the predominate lifeform on Arrakis, both honored and feared; vital and deadly. The sandworms were extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sensed each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. 

===Size===

By anyone's standards, Sandworms could grow to an enormous size. Dr. [[Wellington Yueh/XD|Wellington Yueh]] cited that specimens "up to 450 meters long" were spotted by observers in the deep desert. To make a comparison, the largest animal on earth was believed to be a Blue whale measuring in at only 33 meters, or about 12% of an average sandworm's length. 

Many things commonly associated with Arrakis are surrounded in myth and mystery, and the sandworms are no exception. Some people believe that worms from 700 to even 1000 meters existed in the southern pole regions. This was neither confirmed nor denied. See [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] during his trial of the sandrider for further reading regarding their maximum observed size. 

===Age===

Due to the difficulty of studying these creatures, not much was originally known about the wild sandworms. The longevity of the sandworm was supposedly extreme, estimated in the thousands of years. 

===Appearance===

[[File:Hr-giger-dune-worm-xii.jpg|thumb|Sandworm as envisioned by H.R. Giger]]
Their skin was thick, rough, and orange colored. It served the simple function of armor and was comprised of many scales, each a few feet in size. These scales overlapped and interlocked to form the armor that protected it against internal sand invasion. 

As the Fremen discovered, this armor, while all but impenetrable, could be exploited. By prying open one or more of the scales, the integrity of the armor would be compromised; sand was now free to enter into the sandworms softer insides. This would cause intense irritation for the sandworm. The beast would then roll itself until the prone scale was at the highest point from the desert floor, thus minimizing the amount of sand that could enter. 

A fremen poised to "ride" the beast as it rolled its open scale towards its highest point could literally mount the worm. As long as the scales remained open, the sandworm would not submerge. [[Maker hook]]s were then placed towards the front of the beast to control lateral movement. As a result, wormriding became a viable, even sacred, method of transport for the Fremen across the surface of the planet. Indeed, distances were even measured in "sandworms". A 20-worm ride would be a far, long and difficult journey. 

A sandworm's internal workings resembled that of a massive blast furnace, producing intense heat and flames. This in turn provided the environmental link of supplying oxygen to the nearly plantless Arrakis. The mouth was positioned at the forward end of the creature and could easily consume gigantic objects such as [[spice harvester]]s. 

===Smell===

The smell of the sandworm has been particularly documented. A strong, flinty, cinnamon smell exuded from the beast, especially from the mouth. Some said it could be smelled before seen. The presence of the spice melange was intense and so was its odor. 

===Lightning===

The approach of a sandworm towards its breach-point was often indicated by the dry lightning that frequently occurred in the area; a result of static electricity being discharged into positively-charged air. 

===Diet===

The main component of the sandworm's diet was sand, and other inorganic and dry components of the Arrakis crust. It is also believed they sifted the [[sand-plankton]] for nourishment. 

===Water Poisoning===

Water was fatal to a sandworm, even in small doses. Water that entered a sandworm's body would act as catalyst to accelerate its metabolism to the point that it became unstable and its life support failed. This was a violent and presumably painful death for the sandworm. It was necessary however, in so far that the byproduct of the sandworm/water mixture was the highly toxic poison called the [[Water of Life]], which [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mothers]] used on various occasions. 

===Creation===

The process of sandworm creation began when [[sandtrout]] banded together after converging on a store of water deep beneath the surface of Arrakis. Indeed, water did occur naturally on Arrakis. However, due to the aforementioned process, it was always destroyed. The sandtrout/water mixture was then converted it into a liquid chemical that the sandworm was capable of digesting without being poisoned. On a side note, this chemical could erupt up to desert's surface in a violent explosion called a [[pre-spice mass]]. 

The sandtrout that survived this event would then coalesce and complete the metamorphosis into a young sandworm. 

==Cultural Impact==

Insofar as the sandworm was essential to the creation of the spice melange, on a macro scale the sandworm had an enormous impact on humanity. 

To the planet's Fremen population, the creature was a spiritual symbol of their faith and saw them as physical embodiments of the One God of their original [[Zensunni/XD|Zensunni]] religion. Within Fremen culture the sandworm had several additional names, notably The Maker and [[Shai-Hulud]], which variously meant Old Man of the Desert, Old Father Eternity, or Grandfather of the Desert. 

Young sandworms were used by the Fremen for special ceremonies. Inducting a new [[Sayyadina]] or reverend mothers was a prime example of the sandworms essential cultural role. 

==History==

===Atreides Empire===

After the rise of the [[Atreides Empire]] and the propagation of the Arrakis-variant of the Zensunni religion across the known universe, the reverence paid to the sandworm spread to other worlds. This continued through the rule of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], due to the fact that he had become something of a hybrid, both man and worm. 

The terraforming of Arrakis posed a grave risk to the sandworm, which found life outside the arid desert fatal. The terraforming reversal process had begun by the end of Leto's reign, and he himself devolved back into sandtrout at his death. These events saw the sandworm once again thrive on Arrakis for approximately another 1500 years. During Leto II's reign some smaller sandworms were also removed and shipped off with colonizing vessels during the [[Scattering/XD|Scattering]]. This exercise yielded questionable success. 

===Death on Rakis===

The hostile actions taken by the [[Honored Matres/XD|Honored Matres]] saw the termination of all life on Rakis, including, it was believed, the remaining sandworms. However, this was not before [[Miles Teg/XD|Miles Teg]] and [[Darwi Odrade]] had managed to capture a sandworm. Held in an artificial environment on [[Chapterhouse/XD|Chapterhouse]], the secret and temporary base of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, this worm would have been the key to re-seeding its population. 

===On Other Planets, In Other Places===

====Chapterhouse====

The first place that Odrade's sandworms began a new spice cycle was on the Bene Gesserit homeworld of [[Chapterhouse]]. After their introduction, the sand trout began to turn the once-lush world into a desert. Eventually, [[Mother Commander]] [[Murbella/XD|Murbella]] of the combined Gesserit/Matres group, The [[New Sisterhood]], was able to pay for starships and other off-world materials with the melange that the worms produced. 

====Qelso====

Odrade's sisters also colonized the lush climate world of [[Qelso]], and after only 30 years, the sandworms turned it into a very inhospitable place to live. [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]'s [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]'', visited the planet as they fled from the [[Enemy/XD|Enemy]]. They tried to convince the inhabitants of Qelso they were fighting a losing battle, to which the natives did not agree. Later, when Duncan assumed his role as the combined [[Evermind]] and Ultimate [[Kwisatz Haderach/XD|Kwisatz Haderach]], Idaho revisited the planet. He left sentient [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]] robots with the [[ghola/XD|gholas]] of [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]] and [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet Kynes]], to help divide the planet into lush areas and sand areas. 

====Synchrony====

On the Day of [[Kralizec/XD|Kralizec]], when tantamount change came to the universe, the ghola of Leto Atreides II and [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana Brugh]] were left aboard the ''Ithaca'' as prisoners near the [[Cathedral]] on [[Synchrony]]. To disrupt the ordered pattern of life for the Thinking Machines and their rulers, [[Omnius]] and [[Erasmus]], Leto and Sheeana released the giant six sandworms and their leader, [[Monarch]], held in the ''Ithaca's'' cargo bay. The worms cascaded over and under the surface of Synchrony, in which they destroyed buildings and caused chaos and mayhem. After the banishment of Omnius and the sharing of Erasmus and Idaho, Leto decided to merge his cellular sturcture with that of the giant worms; in which he believed he fulfilled his role in the universe and his personality. 

After Idaho gave Synchrony to the a combined custodianship of Bene Gesserit, [[Bene Tleilax/XD|Tleilaxu]], and Thinking Machine overlordship, the worms still produced spice in a segregated portion of the planet. 

====Buzzell====

A ghola of the famed [[Tleilaxu Master/XD|Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff/XD|Tylwyth Waff]] produced a genetic variant of the sandworm, which thrived in water, called the [[seaworm]]. Under [[Spacing Guild/XD|Guild]] guidance, and with their funds and technology, Waff introduced this changed worm into the seas of the water-world of [[Buzzell]]. These worms produced a super-potent version of melange called [[ultraspice]] in a liver-like organ in their body. 

====On Rakis Again====

After Waff provided the Guild with the seaworms of Buzzell, he began what he considered his most holy mission—returning the worm to Rakis. He released a variant of the sandworm in the sands which had re-inforced armor-piercing appendages at the mouth of the giant creature. Waff's attempt to re-seed [[Arrakis/XD|Dune]] with these creatures failed, as they died over the period of a week. 

On the Day of Kralizec, as Waff was about to give up in futility, he heard a deep rumbling far underground. Sandworms, with the consciousness of Leto II, the Tleilaxu [[Prophet]] within them, burst forth from deep underground the planet. It had turned out that the worms had survived the Matres bombardment forty years earlier, and would thrive again on the world.

Pardot Kynes/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Pardot Kynes}}
'''Pardot Kynes''' [d[[10174 AG|. 10174 AG]]] was an Imperial [[Planetologist]]. At the request of Emperor [[Elrood IX/XD|Elrood IX]], he moved to [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]] to study the planet various natural phenomena. He remained there and married a native [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] woman, [[Frieth]], with whom he had his only child, [[Liet Kynes/XD|Liet-Kynes]].

== History ==

===Early life===

[[Image:Pardo & Liet.jpg|thumb|left|Pardot (left) & Liet on Arrakis]]
Kynes' parents were bureaucratic functionaries, sent to work in the Imperial prison of [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]] when he was just a child and went along with them.

Rumors said that his parents had displeased Emperor Elrood IX somehow, and they had been transferred in disgrace. But young Pardot Kynes had found the wastelands fascinating. After the tutors were finished with him, he'd spent his days exploring the blasted wilderness. He used to take notes and study the scarce ecology that had managed to survive the ancient atomic holocaust.

Later the family was transferred to [[Harmonthep]] but young Pardot returned to Salusa and wrote definitive, complex reports on the ecology of the planet which were published. Once he was pursued by [[Laza tiger]]s there, and survived.

He was an expert and well-respected ecologist, geologist, and meteorologist, with added specialties in botany and microbiology. He could live off the land just about anywhere since his needs were few; the most important of him being the harvesting of scientific knowledge. After Salusa he moved to [[Bela Tegeuse/XD|Bela Tegeuse]] and other worlds.

Eventually he was chosen by Elrood IX among many candidates and was called to [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]]. There his first experience of the astonishing structures amazed him since he was not accustomed to civilized luxury. There, the Emperor ordered him to move to Arrakis and study the planet, hoping to find how the [[Spice Melange|spice melange]] was created.

=== Study of Arrakis Ecology ===
Shortly after his arrival to Arrakis, Kynes became fascinated by the planet's ecology. Specifically, he began to study moisture on the planet, as well as the relationship the Fremen maintained with the land. The inhospitable Harkonnens suffered his presence since he was there by the Imperial order. During one of his first months, he sent to the Emperor two regular progress reports.

Over time, Kynes came to understand the relationship between the [[sandworm/XD|sandworms]] and the spice melange, and the cycle by which spice and sandworms were created. Moreover, Kynes came also to understand the role moisture and water played in this cycle, and how to harness it. Kynes' ideas on reclaiming moisture on Arrakis lead to him developing a plan for the terraforming of the planet, which would eventually see it become a paradise. The strength of Kynes' theories was bolstered by the fact that he accidentally discovered a giant salt pan in the deep desert. This salt pan was evidence that there had once been open water on Arrakis, eons prior.

=== With the Fremen ===
{{quote|Remove yourself.|Pardot Kynes|Dune}}.

Through his studies of Arrakis ecology, Kynes became intrigued with the Fremen, and came to realise that their ways of survival in a harsh environment with brutal overseers in the [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnens]] were sources of strength for them. Indeed, Kynes knew that the Fremen had potential as a people.

During an expedition into the deep desert, Kynes discovered three Fremen youths were being attacked by six Harkonnen bravos near the village of [[Windsack]]. Kynes managed to kill three of the Harkonnens; the two Fremen youths managed to kill the rest while Kynes tended the fallen one with his [[medpak]]. One of them, [[Ommun]], took his [[groundcar]] with his injured companion, [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]], and Kynes was left with [[Turok]], who guided him to his [[Red Wall sietch|sietch]].

There his fate was to be decided by [[Naib]] [[Heinar]]. The issue was debated hotly, especially since the man was an Imperial agent, but killed Harkonnens. Moreover, he spoke of open water returning to Arrakis, with lush greenery. Eventually the sietch leaders decided that Kynes would be killed. When Kynes' killer, [[Uliet]], confronted him, Kynes reportedly said "Remove yourself", and shoved the man aside. It is unclear of the events that immediately transpired. Regardless, the would-be attacker fell on his own [[crysknife]]. This was taken to be a sign by the Fremen that Kynes was to be listened to. Eventually, most Fremen took to Kynes' vision for Arrakis' future. He taught the Fremen children, including his son, the language of ecology, and eventually managed to have the Fremen infiltrate the Imperial system on Arrakis by having some of them man the [[Biological Testing Stations]].

Weeks after his arrival in the sietch, he composed his first report to the Emperor after a long time, which he delivered to Arrakeen. Then he [[Fremen wedding|married]] [[Frieth]], Stilgar's sister who tended him while he stayed with them.

=== Terraforming Arrakis ===
This infiltration allowed for tools to make their way into Fremen seitches, where they were used to cut deep into rock to create [[catchbasin]]s and [[windtrap]]s that would collect water. Kynes had the Fremen collect copious amounts of data on the climate, biology and ecosystems of the planet. Through his research, [[sandtrout]] were discovered. Indeed, it was through the sandtrout that Kynes learned the relationship between the spice and [[Shai-hulud]].

After discovering how melange was created, Pardot Kynes turned his attention to planting greenery. First he began with a certain [[poverty grass]], then moved to others including:
* [[Poverty grass]]
* Ephemerals - [[chenopods]], [[pigweed]]s, [[amarinth]]
* [[Scotch broom]]
* [[Low lupine]]
* [[Vine eucalyptus]] (from [[Caladan]])
* [[Dwarf tamarisk]]
* [[Shore pine]]
* [[Candelilla]]
* [[Suguaro]]
* [[Bis-naga]]
* Shrubs and bushes, including [[camel sage]], [[onion grass]], [[gobi feather grass]], [[wild alfalfa]], [[burrow Bush]], [[sand verbena]], [[evening primrose]], [[incense bush]], [[smoke tree]], [[creosote bush]].

Following this, Kynes then introduced various animals, including:
* Burrowing animals: [[kit fox]], [[kangaroo mouse]], [[desert hare]], [[sand terrapin]]
* Predators, including the [[desert hawk]], [[dwarf owl]], [[eagle]], [[desert owl]]
* Insects, namely [[scorpion]], [[centipede]], [[trapdoor spider]], [[biting wasp]], [[wormfly]]
* The [[desert bat]]

Once Kynes saw the introduction of all these forms of life, he then began to plant more than two hundred different food plants, including [[cotton]], [[melon]]s, [[coffee]] and [[medicinal]]s.

Kynes married into a Fremen seitch and had a son, Liet Kynes. However, he was killed in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] when Liet was nineteen. Liet continued his father's work, both in an official capacity as Imperial Planetologist, but also as Fremen leader, steering them as a people toward an ultimate goal, one that Pardot Kynes had envisioned would take approximately five hundred years. This plan, however, was interrupted by the arrival of [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]].

Liet-Kynes/XD
{{Ex-Or,DE|Liet Kynes}}
[[Image:Pardo & Liet.jpg|thumb|Pardot & Liet (right) on Arrakis]]
'''Liet-Kynes''', also known as '''Weichih Kynes''' was the son of [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] and his wife [[Frieth]] and the father of [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]] (who became the concubine of [[Emperor/XD|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]]), as well as the adopted father of [[Liet-chih]]. Liet was a prominent imperial planetologist/ecologist of [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]], the [[Judge of the Change]], and the secret [[Abu Naib]] of all [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] at the time [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]] took control of Arrakis in 10,191AG.

==History==
During Liet's childhood, he grew up with Warrick, who was a fellow [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] from [[Red Wall Sietch]]. Friends from early childhood, Warrick accompanied Liet Kynes, on many of the routine and everyday occurrences that Liet experienced as a teenager. Among Imperials, Liet was known by the name Weichih.

===Dominic Vernius===
As the two grew into men, they discovered the hidden hideout of the former [[Earl]] [[Dominic Vernius]] who had established an underground base on [[Arrakis/XD|Arrakis]]' [[Southern Polar Region]]. Discovered by the Earl's men while delivering the annual [[melange/XD|melange]] tribute to the [[Spacing Guild/XD|Spacing Guild]], Liet and Warrick were led before the renegade nobleman. The exiled leader of [[House Vernius]] agreed to spare the lives of the young duo, and Liet and Warrick agreed to help the help Dominic better hide his base. Released by Vernius, Liet and his close friend never told of the Antarctic location.

===Marriage to Faroula===
As the two progressed into adulthood, their eyes were caught by a young Fremen women named Farola, daughter of the [[Naib]] of their sietch. Liet confided in Warrick that he had written poetry about Faroula, but the ever confident Warrick sadly stated that Liet would probably never share the words with her. Warrick further re-iterated that he, too, was interested in the teen Fremen maiden. Finally, Farola issued a marriage challenge to both, including Liet, leaving them a note in each of their quarters, that she could be found in the far away [[Cave of Birds]]. The first of the two young males to find her, would be her betrothed.

Liet summoned a Giant [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]],and used his [[Maker hooks]] to guide the beast across the sands of [[Dune]]. Sadly, Liet arrived at the Cave just a few moments later than Warrick did, and as Warrick and Faroula pledged their lives to each other, Liet slowly turned around, and did not interrupt his friend's tender moment.

===Salusa Secundus===
Liet left the Sietch soon afterwards, embittered about his loss of the hand of Faroula, and headed for the Antarctic regions of the planet. He left [[Dune]], and joined Vernius at another of his secret bases on [[Salusa Secundus/XD|Salusa Secundus]]. Liet soon tired of the [[House Corrino/XD|Corrino Empire]] prison world, and Liet headed back to Arrakis.

A few months later, Liet gave word to the Sietch that he was returning to his extended family. Liet gave word to Warrick, and told him to meet him in the Southern Polar Region. Warrick was overjoyed, and the two had a short-lived reunion. Warrick explained to Liet that he and Faroula had formally married in Liet's absence; and within a year, their son, [[Liet-chih]] had been born.

===The Coriolis Storm===
On the way back to their ancient homestead, a fierce [[Coriolis storm]] began to come near them from far off in the desert. The sandworm that they were riding fled deep into the sand as the giant storm approached. A small out-cropping of rock, only big enough for one man, was the only shelter that the duo could find. The two lifelong friends struggled as to whom should use the rock shelter, as the other would almost certainly die, due to being exposed to the fercious sand winds.

Warrick debated that Liet should use the shelter, as he was the son of [[Umma]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]]. Liet demanded that Warrick use the shelter, as he had a wife and child to take care of. As neither would "take no for an answer", and the storm was almost upon them, they left their fate to chance, to throwing [[stick]]s. Warrick cast first, and rolled a score of seven; Liet acquired a nine. As the two argued still further, the storm came upon them, and Warrick pushed Liet into the enclosure.

===The Water of Life===
Liet survived unscathed, but Warrick was critically wounded and blinded; the skin scoured from his face and parts of his body. Liet took him back to the Sietch, to the gasps and horrified look of Faroula and the rest of the Fremen. Warrick announced that he had received a prophectic vision from [[Shai-Hulud]] during the sandstorm, and that more would be revealed about the [[Lisan al Gaib]] if Warrick drank from the [[Water of Life]].

After a few short days, [[Sayyadina]] [[Ramallo/XD|Ramallo]] arrived and administered the deadly Water to Liet's close friend. Warrick was quickly poisoned, but began spouting forth utterances as he suffered towards mortality. He vaguely spoke that "they will not be able to control him" in reference to the Lisan, but Ramallo could not adequately interpret his oraclur speakings. Soon, Warrick died in the process.

===Death of Pardot & Birth of Chani===
Almost immediately, Liet married his best friends' widow, with the blessings of the Sietch, and a few years later, little [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani]] was born to the Fremen couple. Sadly, Liet's father, Pardot, perished in a cave-in as he checked on the progess of one of the terra-forming stations. Liet-Kynes inherited his father's mantle and served as both the planetary ecologist of Dune and leader of the Fremen. He continued his father's vision of gradually terraforming the planet from a harsh desert world into a temperate world with precipitation, greenery, and open water.

===Involvement with House Atreides===
[[Image:Kynes.jpg|right|thumb|135px|Dr. Liet Kynes, as portrayed by actor Max Von Sydow in the 1984 ''Dune'' Movie.]]
Upon the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, Kynes acted as arbiter of succession in regard to the change of [[fief]], as ordered by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV/XD|Shaddam IV]]. Kynes' role was to report to the [[Landsraad/XD|Landsraad]] and the Emperor regarding the legality of the processes used by the Atreides in taking control of the planet, after [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] was ordered to leave.

Through his intelligence network, [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Duke Leto Atreides]] quickly came to realise that, as well as maintaining official imperial duties, Kynes also possessed some authority with the Fremen. Reports indicated that Kynes had "gone native". As a result, Duke Leto attempted to show Kynes as much as possible that he was taking control of the planet in an honourable fashion. Moreover, Leto realised that if he could get Kynes on side, it could possibly go a long way in winning the Fremen over, who had long-standing suspicion and distrust for the [[Faufreluches]] due to their lack of concern for the welfare of the native inhabitants of Arrakis.

===Loyalty and Death===
Kynes' act of saving the Atreides served to illustrate a point: the Atreides, through their honourable ways, could instill fanatic loyalty in people, to the point where they would give their life for them. Indeed, in the case of Liet-Kynes, this is indeed what happened. Upon the return of House Harkonnen to Arrakis, Kynes was captured as an accomplice to the Atreides, the Fremen, and witness of the dishonourable ways of the Harkonnens. He was abandoned in the desert without water or a stillsuit, and ultimately killed when heat exhaustion, dehydration and delirium prevented him from escaping a massive [[spice blow]].

== Legacy ==
Kynes was survived by his daughter, Chani, who later became concubine of Paul. As a result, he was grandfather to the [[God-Emperor]], [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto II]], and his twin sister, [[Ghanima Atreides]]. Kynes' descendants continued the terraforming of Arrakis, until it became a lush and fertile world.

==Ghola During Kralizec==
Kynes was one of the first historical figures reborn as part of [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]]'s ghola project aboard the [[no-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]''. His ''[[Ghola/XD|ghola]]'' grew up on the vessel, and formed a close bond with the ''ghola'' of his former friend [[Stilgar/XD|Stilgar]]. His memories are successfully restored, however Kynes refused to discuss the experience with the other ''gholas''.

After a decade of wandering, the no-ship found the planet [[Qelso]], which was slowly being converted to a desert by [[sandworm/XD|sandworm]]s seeded previously by the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]]. Kynes and Stilgar stayed behind to help a group of natives both slow the advance of the desert, but prepare for the inevitable aridity of the world. Later, following [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]'s merging with the independent robot [[Erasmus]], Duncan returned to Qelso with an army of [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machine]]s to halt the spread of the desert.

Buer Agarves/DE
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Screenshot_2019-03-10-01-17-46-1.png|thumb]]


'''Buer Agarves''' ([[10185 AG]]-[[10219 AG]])- once a [[Tabrite]], then aide to [[Zia]], who directed [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]]'s temple guards during her regency. 

He was a round-faced small man, characteristicly nervous, with sensual good looks and an unshakable faith in the divinity of the Atreides. Agarves kept a Diary fragments of which were used as a source for the [[Dune Encyclopedia]].
==Biography==
A relative to the [[Naib/DE]] [[Stilgar/DE]], Agarves was born at [[Sietch Tabr/DE]] to [[Zagros]] and [[Nacher]]. He was the only son in a family of four sisters. When he was 6 years old, he witnessed the arrival of [[Paul Atreides/DE]] and his mother [[Jessica Areides/DE|Jessica]]. Among his playmates were the sons of Stilgar and [[Harah/DE]] in the [[yali]] of Paul. He was trained in language and other skills and the ways of desert travelling. He enjoyed playing around the [[Sietch/DE]] and hunting [[scorpions]] by light of a [[handglobe]].

When he was 24 he witnessed the return of Paul with pregnant [[Chani/DE]]. He heard the dramatic events attending the birth of the Atreides twins, including how blind Paul threw a [[crysknife/DE]] killing [[Scytale/DE]], the [[Face Dancer/DE]], something that greatly increased his awe for Paul.

Following Muad'Dib's disappearance into the desert, Stilgar brought Agarves to [[Arrakeen/DE]] where he succumbed to the softness of luxurious urban life and water-fat, "like a [[sandworms/DE|worm]] to the sound of a [[thumper]]" as a comentator noted. At first he served in the [[Temple Commissary]], then held several minor positions in the [[Office of the Minister of Finance]] and a short stint in the [[Agriculture Experimental Center]]. 
===Service to Alia===
It was then when he then came to the attention of [[Zia]], the Amazon aide of [[Alia Atreides/DE]] and commander of the Temple guards, and was brought into regent Alia's service.

One of his first duties was to accompany [[Javid]] to Sietch Tabr with messages from Alia. In his notes, Agarves attended Javid the morning they went to Stilgar's quarters. As he stood aside to allow Javid to enter, [[Duncan Idaho/DE]] turned and stabbed Javid with his knife. Agarves drew his own but feared to challenge the fabled Idaho. As he was frozen in indecision, he watched as Idaho goaded Stilgar into a killing rage resulting to Idaho's death.

He returned to recount the outcome of that final mission and to carry Stilgar's "final obedience". Apparently he had seen many of Alia's rages and feared for reprisal if she learned he had stood by and done nothing. So he gave the [[Temple Records]] account "the small lie", reporting that he had been summoned by Stilgar to behold the dead bodies of Javid and Idaho being prepared for [[Huanui]], only after Stilgar had killed Idaho. Alia asked him if he could do anything, and Agarves feared that she penetrated his lie, but Agarves felt justified.

{{quote|For who knows, what the Heavenly Regent wanted me to do? Kill Idaho for killing Javid? Or Stilgar for Idaho? Who can know the mind of the Womb of Heaven?|Buer Agarves|Diary}}

It was common knowledge that he soon took [[Javid]]'s place in Alia's bed and became her "little plaything". Alia commanded him to kill Stilgar promising him to become Naib of Tabr. Shocked by the order, Agarves actively started looking for his old Naib who had fled to the desert with [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima]] and [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]]. With the limited resources Alia allowed him, and her frequent recallings to Arrakeen, his plan proved fruitless. Alia confessed that her initial command was a result of ravaging grief but now she had forgiven him and only wanted Stilgar to return to Sietch Tabr; Alia also gave him as a parting gift new boots, where a transitter was secreted. Agarves,who was now revlted by her excesses, believed her and left for [[Red Chasm Sietch/DE]]. Stilgar's friend [[Nurel]] was persuaded to send a [[distrans]] to Stilgar requesting a parley. 

Stilgar, who had taken refuge with his party in an abandoned [[djedida]] consented, and Agarves with 9 companions were taken blindfolded there. Agarves delivered Alia's terms of pardon to Stilgar, and also denounced her openly. Shortly after however, her forces, who followed his transmitter, swarmed in the meeting room. Shortly before being overwhelmed, and exactly as Alia had hoped, Stilgar stabbed Agarves in his chest.

Rothar
{{encyclopedia}}

[[File:Seli,.jpeg|thumb]]

'''Rothar''' was a [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] and the first wormrider.

In [[7265 AG]] Rothar was in a party investigating a new spicesand when a large [[sandworm/DE|Sandworm]] appeared nearby. His peers scrambled to the safety of a nearby outcropping of rocks before the worm drew too near. Rothar, evidently too stunned by the worm's arrival to move, found himself only centimeters from the creature's side as it rose from the sand; he seized the leading edge of one
of the worm's ring segments and held on tightly, perhaps in an attempt to avoid the worm's flashing teeth.

The sandworm rolled quickly, raising the segment the young Fremen had opened high above the surface of the sand (thereby putting
Rothar on top of its body, as well). It then sped off into the desert, with Rothar as passenger.

Within days, the first crude [[maker hooks/DE|maker hooks]] (designed to catch and hold open the edge of a worm's skin segments) had been fashioned and volunteers from every [[sietch/DE|sietch]] were becoming sandriders. 

Refined techniques were discovered with the price of many lives of the earliest practitioners who were killed in the attempt; but within another generation the Fremen's means of travel was firmly established.

'''Naib Stilgar''' was a [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] who was the [[Naib]] of [[Sietch]] [[Sietch Tabr|Tabr]] and the Governor of [[Arrakis]] from 10196 AG onwards. He was a close friend and chief advisor to [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul-Muad'Dib Atreides]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and with Kynes {{C|10140s-10191}} ===
Stilgar was born in [[Red Wall Sietch]]; he was the brother of [[Frieth]]. By the year [[10154 AG/XD|10154 AG]], he was a young man and good friends with [[Turok]] and [[Ommun]].  This year he and his friends were saved by [[Planetologist]] [[Pardot Kynes/XD|Pardot Kynes]] from bullying [[House Harkonnen/XD|Harkonnen]] bravos. The act resulted in a lifelong friendship and in Stilgar adopting Kynes' dream of transforming Arrakis into a clement and green planet along with the other Fremen. By [[10166 AG]], Stilgar, Turok and Ommun had become the Planetologist's most loyal and devoted guerilla lieutenants. They had also become the secondary leaders under Kynes of the many Fremen sietches who had joined the plan to terraform Arrakis by [[10170 AG]]. 

Stilgar himself brought the news of Pardot's death in a cave-in at [[Plaster Basin]] to his nineteen-year-old son [[Liet-Kynes/XD|Liet-Kynes]] in [[10174 AG]]. In the years following this event Stilgar developed an equally close relationship with Liet, the new Planetologist. Stilgar led a raid on [[Hadith Sietch]] in [[10175 AG/XD|10175 AG]]. Stilgar became Naib of Sietch Tabr later in the year when he [[call out|called out]] and defeated the existing Naib. He went on to establish himself as one of the most respected and fearsome Fremen.

=== Desert War {{C|10191-10193}} ===

==== Change of fief ====
Upon the change of the Arrakis fief in [[10191 AG]] from [[House Harkonnen/XD|House Harkonnen]] to [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]], Stilgar was befriended by Atreides [[Swordmaster]] [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]], who had been sent in advance by [[Leto Atreides I/XD|Duke Leto Atreides]] to gauge and study the Fremen. In Idaho's reports to Leto, Idaho had judged Stilgar to be a 'good example' of the Fremen of Arrakis. Indeed, through Idaho's relationship with Stilgar and his tribe, he became so impressed with the Fremen and their ways that Idaho accepted dual loyalties to the Atreides and to Stilgar.

====Open war====
After House Harkonnen [[Siege of Arrakeen|attacked]] Arrakis and House Atreides went renegade, beginning the [[Desert War]], the remaining members of the Atreides family, namely the Ducal heir [[Paul Atreides/XD|Paul Atreides]] and his mother, the [[Jessica Atreides/XD|Lady Jessica]], sought refuge with Stilgar and his tribe, who spared them after trying to take their water and being bested. Stilgar soon became a good friend of Paul's. However, over time, as Paul developed his [[prescience|prescient]] powers, Stilgar became more of a religious follower. As the War reached it's climax, Stilgar fought during the [[Arrakis Revolt]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Arrakeen]] in [[10193 AG]], after which Paul became Emperor and Stilgar was granted the stewardship of Arrakis.

=== Muad'Dib's Jihad {{C|10193-10205}} ===

====Sack of Kaitain====
In [[10194/XD|10194 AG]], Stilgar led the forces of [[Muad'Dib's Jihad/XD|Paul's loose Jihad]] on [[Sack of Kaitain|the sack]] of the former Corrino capital world of [[Kaitain/XD|Kaitain]]. The world fell easily to Stilgar and his [[Fedaykin]] forces, as [[Elias]] and other troops, ransacked the buildings of [[Corrinth City]]. As the [[Fremen/XD|Fremen]] gutted the [[Imperial Opal Palace]], the [[Imperial Necropolis]], and destroyed countless museums, members of the [[Landsraad]] became concerned about the Dune-warriors sensibilities.

Paul arrived on Kaitain in [[10196 AG/XD|10196 AG]] to address the Landsraad for the first time since assuming the Royal Throne, the Emperor explained that the destruction of Kaitain was the true ending of the [[Corrino Empire/XD|Corrino Empire]]. Stilgar listened behind Paul, as many of the nobles fell into line behind [[House Atreides/XD|House Atreides]]. Others, such as [[Earl]] [[Memnon Thorvald]], of [[House Thorvald]], had witnessed the sack of Kaitain firsthand, stormed out of the Assembly, to foment a rebellion.

====Near-Death on Jericha====
Stilgar led many battles throughout the [[Atreides Empire]] for [[Muad'Dib (Paul Atreides)/XD|Muad'Dib]], but later in the year of 10196, Stilgar had a life-changing experience on the planet [[Jericha]]. As Stilgar led [[Muad'dib's Jihad/XD|Jihadi]] troops against the rebel guerilla forces of Earl Memnon Thorvald; the Atreides' commander, [[Burbage]], had warned Stilgar of attacking Thorvald's forces in the mountains in a frontal assault, and told Stilgar to attack in stealth.

Stilgar ignored the warnings of Burbage and attacked first with [[ornithopter]]s and other air craft. The forces of Thorvald were arrayed in the mountains and had [[suspensor]]-suppressing equipment, which casued all of the aircraft to crash. Still committed to a forceful attack, Stilgar and the Jihadi forces had to confiscate [[ruh-yak]]s from the local Jericha townsfolk, and make a dangerous journey up into the hill country. As the ruh-yaks crossed over the river, Stilgar and his Fremen, began to panic, and some started to drown. As Stilgar had a near-death experience as the river water filled his lungs, Burbage lifted him out of the water, and began pumping his lungs, and saved his life. Stilgar decided to retire to Arrakis, and become Paul's chief advisor.

=== Later life {{C|10205-10217}} ===
In [[10205 AG]], at the end of Paul's Jihad, Stilgar helped him settle the [[Tupile Treaty]] and the matter of the [[Ixian Confederacy]]. In [[10207 AG/XD|10207 AG]], when Paul walked into the desert, blind, Stilgar executed the [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam/XD|Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[Korba/XD|Korba the Panegyrist]] and the Guild [[Steersman]] [[Edric]], disobeying Paul's prior orders against this. A few months later, Stilgar and Jessica secretly agreed to take the water of Paul's concubine [[Chani Kynes/XD|Chani Kynes]], who had died in childbirth, for safekeeping while the [[Regent]] [[Alia Atreides/XD|Alia Atreides]] was engrossed in her search for the rebel [[Bronso of Ix/XD|Bronso Vernius]] of [[Ix/XD|Ix]] and his associates.

In [[10219 AG|10217 AG]], later in the regency of Alia, who had become possessed by the [[ego-memory]] of Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen/XD|Vladimir Harkonnen]], Stilgar declared Sietch Tabr neutral in the war between the allies of the Lady Jessica and her grandchildren and Alia. However, he killed the Duncan Idaho ghola (Hayt) who was Alia's wife, after Duncan killed [[Javid]], violating sanctuary, and so was forced to turn against the Regent. After this, he was instrumental in allying the Fremen tribes with the allies of Jessica. Upon the ascension of [[Leto Atreides II/XD|Leto Atreides II]] not long after, Stilgar thought of a time earlier in the year when he thought of slaying Leto while he was sleeping, and privately noted that it was now 'too late'.  

===Legacy===
Stilgar lived a long and prestigious life, thanks in no small part to his diet of [[Spice Melange/XD|melange]], a pervasive ingredient in all Fremen food and drink. Stilgar's descendants flourished well into the reign of Leto II the [[God-Emperor]], and probably beyond.

He wrote a preface for the book ''"Muad'Dib, The Man"'' for the Princess [[Irulan Corrino/XD|Irulan]].

=== Ghola during Kralizec ===
Stilgra  was one of the first historical figures reborn as part of [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]] [[Reverend Mother/XD|Reverend Mother]] [[Sheeana Brugh/XD|Sheeana]]'s ghola project aboard the [[No-ship/XD|no-ship]], the ''[[Ithaca]]''. His ''[[Ghola/XD|ghola]]'' grew up on the vessel, and formed a close bond with the ghola of his former friend, Liet-Kynes. Stilgar's memories were successfully restored through a recreation of his near-death experience on Jericha.

After a decade of wandering, the no-ship found the planet [[Qelso]], which was slowly being converted to a desert by [[Sandworm/XD|sandworms]] seeded previously by the [[Bene Gesserit/XD|Bene Gesserit]]. Stilgar and Kynes stayed behind to help a group of natives both slow the advance of the desert, but prepare for the inevitable aridity of the world. Later, following [[Duncan Idaho/XD|Duncan Idaho]]'s merging with the independent robot [[Erasmus]], Duncan returned to Qelso with an army of [[Thinking Machines/XD|Thinking Machines]] to halt the spread of the desert.

Stilgar was played by Everett McGill in the [[Dune (1984 movie)|1984 Dune movie]]; by Uwe Ochsenknecht in the [[Dune (2000 miniseries)|2000 Dune miniseries]]; and by Steven Berkoff in the [[Children of Dune (2003 miniseries)|2003 Children of Dune miniseries]].

Chani Kynes/DE
[[File:Chani_bw.png|thumb]]Lady '''Chani Atreides''', born as '''Chani Kynes''', was the [[Fremen/DE|Fremen]] daughter of [[Liet Kynes]] and mate of [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]]. She died giving birth to [[Leto Atreides II/DE|Leto Atreides II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides/DE|Ghanima Atreides.]]
==Biography==
===Early life===
Chani was born in 10177 in [[Sietch Tabr/DE|Sietch Tabr]], the daughter of the secret leader of Liet Kynes and [[Falra|Faroula]]. [[Stilgar]] and his wife [[Misra]] stood as her godparents and performed the [[Water of Conception]] ritual for her.

Her father was mostly out, and sometimes had to steal some days from his work at the palmaries to visit her. Her father occasionally took her to the planting sites and tutored her about his work. He was very proud of her quick intellect. Liet however did not wish for Chani to inherit him as an Imperial servant and have a double life like him, and decided that she'd live entirely as a Fremen.

Chani was raised mostly by [[Falra|Faroula]], with some assistance from Misra and the other woman. She was only 3 years old when Falra was killed in a rockslide and Chani was taken into Stilgar's household and soon became a part of the Naib's family. She attended the spirit-releasing ceremony without weeping.

By the age of 5 Chani was helping at the sietch gardens, captured [[sandtrout/DE|sandtrout]] for the [[deathstill]], or dispatched enemy wounded after battles. Later she learned to perform occupation she would be required to now as an adult, like weaving, to making coffee, making and mending [[Stillsuit|stillsuit.]]

Chani was in a small group of girls in their puberty who retreated with [[Reverend Mother/DE|Reverend Mother]] [[Ramallo]]. On their last day the group went on a ''[[hajra]]'' to one of the tribal holding basins. They seated around Ramallo, altered a small quantity of the [[Water of Life/DE|Water of Life]] and bid each of them drink from it. Then, as the girls entered the drug-induced trance, Ramallo told them that the basin held the future life of their people, and each of them held a small portion of that in their bodies. The talk relaxed them, as their minds pondered the future of their tribe, and Ramallo (already in an advanced age and without an apprentice) probed for the one who would take her place, and it was Chani who demonstrated the most necessary traits: compassion, intelligence and courage, conscious of her own mortality while discounting it for their people. Chani was initiated in the following tribal assembly, and returned to Tabr three months before the war that erupted on Arrakis.
===Meeting Paul===
Stilgar had received an order from Liet-Kynes to take a band out into the desert with Chani along as part of the group in search of Paul Atreides and his mother, the BG [[Jessica Atreides/DE|Lady Jessica]] and messages sent back to the sietch by the [[Shadout Mapes/DE]] had indicated that Jessica might be something more. Ramallo seconded that decision and wished to hear Chani's impressions of the encounter. Chani was filled with wonder by the murmurings that her son was the [[Lisan al-gaib]], but she was more impressed by the out-freyn Sayyadina, who had bested Stilgar in single combat using her [[weirding way]]s. The hot-tempered [[Jamis]] challenged Jessica's part in the legend and Paul killed him with a knife, without receiving a scratch, proving he is not a soft outworlder. 

Ramallo did not survive long enough for Chani to succeed her and Jessica "passed within" to become a Reverend Mother and taking Ramallo's place and had converted the [[Water of Life/DE]] for the tribe, distributing it among them to induce the [[spice orgy]]. Sensitive to the wishes of the others, who wished to enjoy their communion without the discordant note of Usul's alien mind, she drew Usul away. The two of them retreated to her private quarters, scarcely feeling the presence of the rest of the tribe. She reminded him that they both lost their fathers to the [[House Harkonnen/DE|Harkonnens]], and Paul shared his visions with her in the spice-trance. The two became inseparably joined.

In the following months Usul had to learn the Fremen ways and adapt. Chani was the [[Sayyadina]] of the Rite when Usul became a [[sandrider]], and observed in fright the struggle between him and Stilgar. She rejoiced in the legend and power growing around him, exulting in his victories, while she herself killed any challengers she considered unworthy of facing him, adding to his status despite Jessica's misgivings concerning their "marriage of youth". She gave birth to [[Leto Atreides II the Elder|Leto Atreides II the Elder,]] named in honor of the martyred Duke. 

The most frightening moment was after Paul's three-week sleep in the Waters of Life. When Chani came to revive him shetested his reaction to the illuminating poison in its raw state (something that Jessica had not thought to try). In the final battle for Arrakis in 10193, the boy Leto was killed, something that broke her after withstanding so many deaths. Paul Atreides wrested control of the planet and forced the abdication of [[Shaddam IV/DE|Shaddam IV]], but Chani took no joy in the victory and could take comfort only from Paul's presence. He knew about his death already when Chani came to brought him the news.

===Atreides Reign===
Chani spent the following three years in negotiations preceding Paul's formal acceptance by the [[Landsraad/DE|Landsraad]] and the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]] as an assistant to Lady Jessica in bargaining with the deposed emperor. As his Royal Concubine they had practiced contraception in the Fremen way during the years when his full attention was required for the negotiations. She must have won many of the concessions during endless round of talks, resulting to Jessica often saying, that she hoped never to have to negotiate any kind of terms against a Fremen  since their ferocity in battle paled before their determination at a conference table.

During this period five attempts were made on her life. Once, the assassin managed to infiltrate her apartments but he did not succeed in his aim and Chani managed to dispatch him with her [[crysknife]]. She burst into the Council Chamber, her robe stained with her assailant's blood and her hand poised on the sheathed crysknife's handle. Jessica — as Chani had anticipated — focused her attention on Princess [[Irulan Corrino/DE|Irulan]], soon to be Paul's Consort-in-name. She was genuinely stunned, and a brief expression of surprised delight escaped her (as she had been angered by her secondary place) before her Bene Gesserit training could conceal it, convincing Jessica of her innocence.

Paul's reign was officialized in 10196 and for the next twelve years Chani served him as wife, companion, and advisor. They tried for a royal heir,  but as Irulan was administering her a potent contraceptive drug through her food, Chani could not conceive. Her continued childlessness caused her great pain. In spite of revulsion at the thought of Paul's making Irulan his wife-in-fact, Chani was so distressed by her inability to provide an heir for House Atreides that she at last suggested that he allow Irulan to have her chance as the only logical source for progeny. This suggestion made Paul at first angry and suspicious that Irulan might have used Chani to advance her schemes for power, and told her that Irulan was too dangerous and her position would be secured. 
===Pregnacy===
Chani was convinced that the Imperial physicians could be of no further help, and reverted to the Fremen traditions; after praying and consulting older women from among the tribes, she embarked on a special diet that was supposed to promote fertility. A trusted friend from Tabr brought to her the ingredients and Chani prepared her meals, not allowing anyone else to touch the food. Within weeks, Chani was pregnant, but during her first session with the doctors traces of the contraceptive were found in her system, now being cleared by the new regimen. Long-term ingestion of the contraceptive, interacting with the [[spice/DE|melange]], had harmed Chani: from the moment the twin fetuses occupied her womb, her metabolism had sped up to a terrifying rate and had to eat 3-4 times her ordinary food along with increasingly larger doses of the spice. The interactions of the contraceptive and the increased intake of the melange accelerated the pregnancy; the children would be born in less than six months, assuming she would survive.

Usul asked her to spare the Princess, but nothing could calm Chani's hatred toward her. During the rest of her pregnancy a fog surrounded her, limiting her vision until she could see only as far ahead as the birth. In her preoccupation with it, Chani was affected (as from a distance) by external problems, like the plot against the emperor, Paul's blindness in the wake of the stonebumer attack. She could not be certain even of what she was feeling among her fast changing emotions, or why. She snapped at Paul for wearing a shabby old jacket, and having been told that "even an emperor has his favorite clothing" she found herself giving water to the dead. She once told Paul that her life would have to begin again from the day of labour, and his silence only added to her confusion.

As she was sure he would, Paul returned with her to Tabr for the children to be born. When she was conversing with the ghola of [[Duncan Idaho/DE|Duncan Idaho]], on a spot she chose for a look out over the desert, the moment came, and with his guidance she made it back into the sietch. Her last thought, was that she was unsure if Usul knew she carried twins, and before she abandoned herself to the pains of labor. Less than an hour after the onset of contractions, calling for her Usul, Chani died giving birth to their son and daughter. 
===Death===
[[Scytale]], the [[face dancer]], prospected pf restoring her as a [[ghola]] and bargained with [[Alia Atreides/DE|Alia Atreides]] then Paul who killed him. [[Bijaz]] made the same offer until Duncan Idaho slew him, putting his master out of temptation's reach, and her body was taken to the [[deathstill]].

Even Irulan joined at the ceremony held that evening to release her spirit, astonishing the friends of Chani, triggering muttering and anger since it was believed that she would defile the ritual. When her turn came, she walked to the pile of Chani's belongings heaped on the cavern floor, picked up a small stone pendant and said that noble character and noble birth are different things. In [[Fremen language]] she concluded "''Ish yara al-ahdab hadbat-u''" (a hunchback does not see his own hunch). It was the first sign of Irulan's defection from the Bene Gesserit before becoming one of the adults responsible for raising Paul's and Chani's twins.

Fremen/DE
{{DE-Or,Ex|Fremen}}{{Stub}}[[File:Fremen_clothing (art by Matt Howarth, The Dune Encyclopedia).png|thumb|Fremen - Illustration by [[Matt Howarth]]]]

The '''Fremen''' were a sub-culture of [[human]]s, the natives of the planet [[Arrakis/DE|Arrakis]], descended from the [[Wandering Zensunni/DE|Zensunni Wanderers]]. They were hard in survival, adapted in the harsh environment of the planet.

They formed an integral part in the establishment of the [[Atreides Empire]] and [[Fremen Jihad|Muad'Dib's Jihad]] launched by [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Atreides]], their adopted leader, after which their life dramatically changed.
==History==
===Origins===
{{main|Wandering Zensunni/DE}}
The Fremen are believed to come from the [[Zensunni/DE|Zensunni]] ultimately considering [[Poritrin/DE|Poritrin]] their homeworld.

In [[7193 AG]], all known Zensunni in the Imperium ended their ''[[hajra]]'' when transported to Arrakis. This was organized in deep secret by the [[Spacing Guild/DE|Spacing Guild]], when they brought them from [[Ishia]], [[Rossak/DE|Rossak]] and perhaps [[Harmonthep/DE|Harmonthep]]. This served the purposes of both sides: it gave the Zensunni a home on a world where they would be too difficult to dig out. It also gave the Guild a permanent entree to Arrakis and its spice.

The Guild ensured that the Zensunni were established deep enough inside the desert far from those settlers already on Arrakis (concentrated chiefly in [[Arrakeen/DE|Arrakeen]], the seat of government). From that point on, the Zensunni recognized themselves not as a religion but as a people, and they called themselves "Fremen". 

===During Muad'dib===
Then, while villages and cities grew and water resources increased, the discipline that marked Fremen society was forgotten and individualism became socially accepted. [[Leto II Atreides]] imposed restrictive policies, empasizing learning only agricultural skills in his pastoral empire. He also cut communications and interstellar travel to provide a feudal piece. 

Eventually the Fremen grew soft and more isolated from each other, with less enemies. Once the struggle for survival was removed, they lost their will to live.

In [[12758 AG]] Leto II declared them an endangered population and his [[Fish Speakers]] moved them to the [[Fremen Museum]] which replicated the ancient sietch ways. Leto treated them as his playthings, nurturing them but while constraining the scope of their lives.

==Appearance==
[[File:Fremen clothing.png|thumb|Examples of Fremen attires.]]
Casual clothing favored tones of yellow, green, blue, crimson for trouser and jerkin. Formal clothing required a black/buff cloak of [[merino]] wool. Women tended to choose earth tones, sand-color or beige. They wore [[tilsam]]'s or medallions with religious themes. Older men wore chains with rings symbolizing the [[water rings]] they won in battle, and a small turban or scarf.

Men's trousers were made of a merium-weight brocade weave, while women's of a fine cotton (like the expensive sheer cotton from [[Loomar]]). Women wore a ''[[guimlik]]'' and a sheer gown, the ''[[entary]]''. Children wore a ''[[tshka]]'' under the jacket.

In house they wore heelless slippers or boots. Women in dressier occasions wore a high-heeled boot of soft kidskin.

Women also wore water-rings as jewelry at the waist, braided into the hair or as part of a headdress, attached with sheer veil.

Also, Fremen's eyes were blue-within-blue, as an effect of spice addiction.

==Culture==
The Fremen broke away to pursue an ultraconservative way of life  according to the ways of the fathers. During the first days of their exile on Arrakis, they used to sacrifice virgins, a practice that briefly returned during the rule of Leto II Atreides.

Dune was a planet which by nature promoted self-sufficiency and individualism. While farming is a social activity, survival on Dune was depended on hunting and gathering, favoring the strong individual; while a cold climate drives people closer for survival, arid climate means that some survive while others die. In short terms, the necessity of life-and-death decisions does not promote social ties.

Each tribe was commanded by a [[Naib/DE|Naib]] who had absolute authority of life and death. However he could be challenged if his rule was unacceptable.

The core of their society was the ''[[sietch/DE|sietch]]''. Many sietches existed on the planet, and one was capable of containing thousands of people. The sietches did not have a close contact however and each individual did not care about how many other sietches besides his, existed. 

Fremen lived on simple fare. [[Kulon]]s carried the family's belongings. They rose at sunset and slept at dawn.<ref>This is implied in the article FREMEN COOKING, but other articles suggest otherwise.</ref>
===Language===
{{main|Fremen language}}
The Fremen spoke a language descendant of the Arabic of [[Terra]]. They were highly conservative and believed it to be a treasure that they ought to preserve and it would be a sin to spurn it with other tongues since it preserved the wisdom of the fathers.

===Family===
Fremen children were raised by their individual households and not communally, but every adult in a community accepted some responsibility for their welfare; the nearer relationship to the child's parents, meant greater obligation.<ref name=chani/>Chani Kynes</ref>

Independence was encouraged in all sietch youngsters so that they not burden the tribe. The Fremen had learned centuries earlier that weak, dependent children could jeopardize an entire sietch by demanding time and attention their parents could not spare, while contributing nothing to the tribal welfare.<ref name=chani/>

===Education===
The earliest lessons Fremen children were taught was that wasting water, in any form, was an unpardonable sin, and thus crying was not allowed since it wasted the body's moisture.<ref name=chani/>

A Fremen was educated from childhood till maturity by all members of a sietch in order to maintain the water principle. A way to train and educated their mind and way of thinking was the [[Riddle Game]].

[[Pardot Kynes/DE|Pardot Kynes]] started the first formal sietch schools, dreaming an eco-siociological change and taught about vegetation, snow, rivers, lakes and other things that didn't exist on Arrakis. [[Paul Atreides/DE|Paul Muad'dib]] during his rule converted their culture to a militaristic and young Fremen started to learn interstellar assault tactics in the [[Arrakeen War College]].

===Nutrition===
The Fremen ate only two meals, a lighter on rising and a heavier at dawn with dessert, like a [[tabara]]. During the night no more food was eaten, except a drink or coffee after a nap.

The donkeys provided them milk, made into butter, cheese and ''[[kvetch]]''. They were provided fruits (dates, figs, apricots, portygul, Caladanian melon) vegetables and nuts from nearby villages. There were also terraform planting areas and high-altitude temperate zones where they could gather some.

Meat ([[desert hare]] and [[chukka]]) was roasted or stewed with root, served on a torn-open flat bread.

Menstruating women followed a special diet which reduced the water level of their bodies, minimizing therefore the water loss and protecting from a dehydration shock.

In [[10169 AG]] [[Sietch Tabr]] was a the place where the first attempts to raise corps with chromoplastic-lined pits, [[dew collector]]s and other means. The first plants to be cultivated were coffee, [[tabaroot]] and vegetables from [[Salusa Secundus/DE|Salusa Secundus]] which lasted for a small harvest in 3 seasons. 

The plantings expanded to other [[sietch]]es and other species of vegetation in secrecy. Dew collectors could help the growths survive for one year with only pollination necessary by humans. Trained children usually cared for these gardens.

Following Arrakis' planetary transformation, crops could be easily raised as on any other world.

===Life cycle===
Minutes after a baby Fremen was born the amniotic fluid was saved and distilled and was then fed to the infant by its godmother (usually one of the mother's best friends) in the presence of a Sayyadina; this feeding was the baby's first, given before it was returned to the mother to nurse. 

As the baby drank, it was the godmother's duty to say to it, ''Here is the water of thy conception''. In this way, the child was seen as having been tied to its parents by the bond of water, as well as being tied, by extension to the rest of the tribe.

Cowards, weaklings, and other such undesirables were never given the opportunity to clutter the gene pool; as further insurance, children born out of wedlock were left in the desert, a sacrifice to Shai-Hulud.

A Fremen was educated from childhood till maturity by all members of a sietch in order to maintain the water principle. A way to train and educated their mind and way of thinking was the [[Riddle Game]]. Education concerning issues such as menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing was considered too vital to be left to the individual parents. At puberty, the girls were taken on a week's retreat (''[[hajra]]'') by the Reverend Mother of their sietch, during which the special functioning of the female stillsuits was explained to them, the ingredients and preparation the moisture-reducing diet during menstruation, the birth-control method of their mate counterparts, and the most reliable means of determining the most fertile days during their cycle.

On their return to the sietch, the young women were welcomed as new adults and received their own ''[[yali]]'' in their parents' households. More responsible tasks were assigned them, and they were considered eligible for marriage. Those selected by their Reverend Mothers during the last day of the retreat were also considered eligible for the Sayyadina.

Young males, or ''[[wali]]'', were those yet to meet another male in mortal combat. Those could not marry since the only men who would father children would be those who had already proven themselves capable of survival. At that, or some other point, the male Fremen was given a [[Fremkit/DE|Fremkit]].<ref>DE p. 251</ref>

A menstruating woman would be put on a sophisticated diet which dramatically decreased the body water level. This not only lessened the amount of moisture available to be lost, but also dropped the level gradually to avoid a sudden shock. Stillsuits for women included a third processing unit for reclaiming the water of blood. Eventually the menstrual cycle gradually lengthened and even leveled off at 56 days. Menopause, was considered a passage nearly as important as puberty. It was customary for a woman's mate, children, and friends to gather for a small party celebrating the safe completion of her fertile years.

When a Fremen died, the body had been run through the [[deathstill]] under the supervision of d Sayyadina and body fluids contained in a bag. A formal memorial service was conducted so that his shade would leave in peace and visit no harm on the tribe at the rising of the sunset on the evening of the death. 

All the members of the sietch would gather around a mound made up of the dead's belongings and water bag. The naib would speak first reminding the others mat the moon rose for their lost comrade and would summon the spirit away that night. He would then declare himself a friend of the deceased, describe a time when he had personally been helped or taught by the dead person, take one item, and claim certain items for the deceased's family and the crysknife, which would be left with the remains in the desert. 

The other members of the tribe would follow the procedure. A Sayyadina came forward last for the water bag to verify its measurement and to turn the [[water rings]] over to the appropriate person.

The tribe then chanted a prayer committing the spirit  and their destinies to Shai Hulud. The sietch watermasters took charge of the bag and poured into the communal basin with the entire tribe serving as witnesses. The dead was honored thus by preserving the living after them survive with their fluids (dishonored members would never be afforded this honor).

The counters for water released by the bodies of Fremen who had died a natural death, or by those of strangers found in the bled who were treated as a water-gift from Shai-Hulud, were consigned to the care of the sietch's Naib and considered held in common by all the people. Those tallying the water once held by enemies killed in group combat were similarly treated.

==Water==
The water was the scarcest and most precious element on Arrakis and it was carefully collected from any source imaginable and consumed carefully. It was considered unlucky to leave free water standing unused unless stored in one of the sietch's evaporation-proof basins.

Every ceremony involving water was conducted or supervised, by a [[Sayyadina/DE|Sayyadina]] (Fremen priestess) initiated in the rites and trained in their practice. In the event that no Sayyadina was available, it was permitted for the female in the group with the greatest knowledge of such matters to be temporarily consecrated into the office. Common pools of water were kept in sietches for all its members to drink from.

Water was even taken from the newborn's amniotic fluid or bodies of the dead. Each pre-dawn [[dew gatherer]]s with scythelike dew reapers, gleaned the available moisture from whatever plants grew near the sietch; then they earned the morning's harvest to a Sayyadina to receive her blessing before carrying it to the tribe's communal basin.

As the water was consumed, the head of the family chanted: "Now do we consume that which will one day be returned for the flesh of a man is his own, but his water belongs to the tribe "

The communal pool provided the sietch with water daily (although less than a liter for a family of ten). The Sayyadina distributing the water to the head of each family gave her blessings, and prayers of thanks were offered to Shai-Hulud. Other bodily fluid was recycled by the stillsuits or in the [[reclamation chamber]]s of a family, whence it was re-distributed before retiring for the night.

[[Water Rings]] were metallic counters that represented the volume of water released by a body processed through a deathstill and also possessed great social significance, helping to regulate much of the interaction between the sexes. 

Water was also seen as the ultimate bond between individuals whether or not they belonged to the same tribe. For instance, a person from one sietch who saved the life of a member of another was owed a water debt, not only from the person saved but from their tribe as well. The [[water bond]] was considered a heavy burden, and was paid and cancelled as quickly as possible.

The water of one group's dead, if shared with another, also created a bond this one indissolvable. Once such a sharing had taken place, the two groups were no longer seen as distinct, since water, once mixed, was impossible to divide.

Equally, if one could force or convince a stranger or enemy to drink of his blood, he became ''[[Wadquiyas]]'' with the tribe: joined to them as one of their own, and safe from having his water taken unless he offended the tribe. Because of this custom, no Fremen would ever attempt to wound an enemy in a fight by biting, no matter how a certain victory would grant to him).

Pledges of loyalty to a single person, (e.g. to a naib of a tribe), were also made in the name of the water of the individual. A tribe's pledge to its leader did not end, nor its acceptance of the new leader's rights begin, until the funeral service for the dead naib was completed and his water free.

Freemen of Dune
{{Expanded}}

[[File:Dune+(1984+Putnam+hardback,+front+cover)-1.jpg|thumb]]

The '''Freemen of Dune''' was the term that evolved from the [[Free Men of Dune|Free Men]] group of Zensunni, which [[Ishmael]] had lead into the [[Deep desert]], away from his stepson [[El'hiim]]. The term "Freemen" was eventually shortened in [[Galach]], into "[[Fremen]]".

'''Chani Kynes''' is a character in the 2021 film ''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]''. She is a member of the [[Fremen]] of [[Arrakis]] and she becomes close with [[Paul Atreides/2021 film|Paul]]. Chani is portrayed by [[Zendaya]].

== Character description ==
''Chani was born on Dune, raised in the ways of its free people the Fremen, and shaped by its wilds to be a confident and dangerous warrior. A relentless defender of the people she loves, she will rise defiant against any outsider seeking to endanger the natural beauty of her world.''<ref>https://www.dunemovie.com/</ref>

== History ==
===Paul's visions===
Chani is absent for most of the Atreides' move to [[Arrakis]], appearing only in visions Paul has when he dreams. She does, however, narrate the most of the story, explaining the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]]'s rule over [[Arrakis]] and their sudden departure, which leads the way for the upcoming massacre of [[House Atreides]].

After the majority of House Atreides is assassinated, Chani appears as a member of the [[Fremen]] tribe under [[Stilgar/2021 film|Stilgar]] when Jessica and Paul escape into the desert. She welcomes Paul into their tribe, but seems blissfully unaware that the two share a connection.

== Physical appearance ==
Chani is young biracial woman with blue-within-blue eyes. She wears a [[stillsuit]].

== Personality ==

== Differences from the original character ==
Chani Kynes is adapted from the [[Chani Kynes|character of the same name]] from the original [[Dune (novel)|''Dune'' novel]]. In the books, Chani's father is [[Liet Kynes]]; since [[Liet Kynes/2021 film|Liet]] is portrayed by a woman in the film, she will presumably be Chani's mother instead.
