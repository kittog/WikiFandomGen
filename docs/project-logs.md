## project logs

### 12.03.2022
Done today: mostly research & brainstorming around the project. As we are free to create a corpus around any topic, we are allowed to be as creative as we wish! Thinking of building a corpus with articles on a fandom.
Questions: database format? how to process wiki markup content?
