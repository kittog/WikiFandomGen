## project logs

### 12.03.2022
Done today: mostly research & brainstorming around the project. As we are free to create a corpus around any topic, we are allowed to be as creative as we wish! Thinking of building a corpus with articles on a fandom.
Questions: database format? how to process wiki markup content?

### 12.04.2022
* New docs in `/data` : *kpop* & *citypop* wiki articles. (.txt files)
* First tries with `markovify` module : quick model implementation & text generation.
* Issues: how to deal with images? templates used in wikipages? (how to process data before training?)
